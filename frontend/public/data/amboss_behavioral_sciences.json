The use of two or more serotonergic medications (in this case, fluoxetine and sumatriptan) increases the risk of developing serotonin syndrome, which causes autonomic stimulation (e.g., hyperthermia, diaphoresis) and neuromuscular hyperactivity (e.g., tremor, hyperreflexia). Other medications associated with serotonin syndrome include SNRIs, MAOIs, TCAs, buspirone, ondansetron, tramadol, linezolid, amphetamines, and MDMA.",

He has had 5 jobs in the past 8 months. He quit each job after 3–4 weeks because he found the work beneath him. He was imprisoned 6 years ago for credit card fraud. He was released from prison on parole a year ago. He was expelled from school at the age of 13 years for stealing school property and threatening to assault a teacher. He has fathered 6 children with 4 women. He says that he does not pay child support because he needs the money for his own personal expenses. Examination of the forearm shows a 6 cm long, 0.5 cm deep wound with neat edges on the dorsal surface of the left forearm. There are bruises on the left shoulder, back, and the proximal phalanges of the right hand. On mental status examination, the patient is alert and calm. His mood is described as cheerful. His thought process, thought content, and speech are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The girlfriend reports that he was started on a new medication for treatment of depressed mood, low energy, and difficulty sleeping 2 weeks ago by his physician. She says that he has had unstable emotions for several months. Over the past 3 days, he has not slept and has spent all his time “training to climb Everest.” He has never climbed before this period. He also spent all of his savings buying mountain climbing gear. Physical examination shows ecchymoses over his right upper extremity, pressured speech, and easy distractibility. He is alert but not oriented to place. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of this patient's current behavior?",

Antidepressant monotherapy (especially venlafaxine and tricyclic antidepressants) in a patient with undiagnosed underlying bipolar disorder increases the risk of developing hypomania or mania.

Moreover, following remission of his manic episode, he should be started on maintenance therapy with a mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium, valproic acid).

The initial management of akathisia consists of switching to an antipsychotic drug with a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (as was done for this patient) or lowering the dose of the prescribed antipsychotic. When compared to high-potency typical antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine), low-potency typical antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine) have a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. However, low-potency typical antipsychotics are associated with a higher risk of anticholinergic effects (e.g., blurred vision, dry mouth) and antihistaminergic effects (e.g., drowsiness), as observed in this patient. Additional α-1 receptor blockade effects may cause orthostatic hypotension.\n\nSee “Overview of adverse effects of antipsychotics” table.",

Long-acting benzodiazepines with active metabolites (e.g., diazepam or chlordiazepoxide) are preferred because they result in a smoother withdrawal course. However, in a patient with advanced liver disease or acute alcoholic hepatitis, short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines with minimal first-pass metabolism and no active metabolites, such as lorazepam and oxazepam, should be used. Delirium tremens has a 5% mortality rate and must be treated urgently.\n\nAlcohol is a CNS depressant. Chronic alcohol use results in an adaptive response to persistent inhibitory tone. This response includes decreased sensitivity to GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) and upregulation of the NMDA receptor (which is activated by glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter). Cessation of alcohol use results in decreased inhibitory tone, which results in the manifestations of alcohol withdrawal (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension, tremors, anxiety, hallucinations, seizures).",

The treatment of MDMA intoxication focuses on controlling the patient's hypertension, arrhythmias, hyperthermia, and hyponatremia. Mild hyponatremia can be treated with fluid restriction. If the patient develops severe hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures, confusion), hypertonic saline is indicated.",

Because study B's 95% confidence interval of the HR excludes 1.0, this study had sufficient statistical power to detect a difference between the groups.

The patient has sickle cell anemia and has been to the emergency department 2 times over the past year because of similar symptoms. Her mother gave her acetaminophen, but the pain continued. Physical examination shows swelling and severe tenderness in her fingers and hands. The diagnosis of an acute sickle cell crisis is established and intranasal fentanyl is ordered for pain control. When the physician informs the patient's mother, she refuses to give consent for the treatment. She says, “My daughter already has this awful illness, she can't get addicted to opiates too. I'm a social worker and have seen so many people get hooked on morphine and then overdose. Most of the time they got it from their doctor first!” Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Some conditions such as acute pain in sickle cell disease require specific pain management. Analgesia for moderate to severe pain associated with vasoocclusive crises may include opioid therapy. The physician has an ethical obligation to act in the patient's best interests and relieve her suffering by providing adequate pain control. However, these ethical principles must be balanced with the need to respect parental autonomy and obtain informed parental consent. In this case, parental consent is required before providing medical care and the patient's mother has raised a valid concern. Therefore, the most appropriate response is for the physician to acknowledge the mother's concerns and reassure her by providing information on the low risk of opioid addiction with short-term inpatient opioid therapy. Studies have shown that the prevalence of opioid use disorder in the sickle cell population is similar to or lower than the prevalence in the general population, with lower mortality as a result of opioid use compared to other chronic pain conditions (e.g., migraines, fibromyalgia).\n\nGenerally, parents and legal guardians may refuse any treatment for a minor under their care. Refusal is only acceptable if that decision does not pose a risk of serious harm to the minor.",

Two years ago, he was diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, for which he underwent radiation therapy. He moved to the area 1 month ago to be closer to his daughter but continues to live independently. He was recently diagnosed with osteoblastic metastases to the spine and is scheduled to initiate therapy next week. In private, the patient’s daughter says that he has been losing weight and wetting the bed, and she tearfully asks the physician if his prostate cancer has returned. She says that her father has not spoken with her about his health recently. The patient has previously expressed to the physician that he does not want his family members to know about his condition because they “would worry too much.” Which of the following initial statements by the physician is most appropriate?",

Common manifestations of inhalant use include mood swings (due to rapid onset and short duration of action), irritability, slurred speech, anorexia, conjunctival injection, poor concentration, ataxia (manifesting as, e.g., dysdiadochokinesia), and an eczematous rash in the perioral area (i.e., the glue-sniffer's rash, which is caused by the drying effects of hydrocarbons), all of which are seen in this patient. In severe cases, inhalant use can cause cardiac arrhythmias and severe central nervous system toxicity (e.g., seizures, coma, and death due to respiratory depression).",

She has experienced intermittent nausea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting every few weeks for the past 6 months. During these periods, she vomits up to 15 times daily. She reports that she takes hot showers multiple times daily, especially during phases of nausea, to alleviate her symptoms. She has no history of serious illness besides undergoing knee surgery for repair of a torn anterior cruciate ligament last year. She does not take any medications. She drinks alcohol socially up to 3 times per week and does not smoke cigarettes. She has been using marijuana 4–5 times per week for 5 years. The patient appears ill. Her temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. An abdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's condition?",

He describes the pain as a sharp, substernal chest pain that radiates to the right shoulder; he says “Please help me. I'm having a heart attack.” He has been admitted to the hospital twice over the past week for evaluation of shortness of breath and abdominal pain but left the hospital the following day on both occasions. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol but is a known user of intravenous heroin. He has been living in a homeless shelter for the past 2 weeks after being evicted from his apartment for failure to pay rent. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The patient seems anxious and refuses a physical examination of his chest. His cardiac troponin I concentration is 0.01 ng/mL. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes. While the physician is planning to discharge the patient, the patient reports numbness in his arm and insists on being admitted to the ward. On the following day, the patient leaves the hospital without informing the physician or the nursing staff. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Acute dystonic reactions are thought to occur as a result of an imbalance between decreased dopaminergic signaling (due to the antipsychotic medication) and increased cholinergic signaling (due to downregulated dopamine). The first-line treatment for acute dystonic reactions is a drug with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, diphenhydramine). Care should also be taken to avoid antipsychotics with a high propensity for EPS. Patients who receive haloperidol may also benefit from prophylactic treatment with benztropine to prevent acute dystonic reactions.\n\nAcute dystonic reactions can also affect the extraocular muscles (oculogyric crisis) and laryngeal muscles (causing life-threatening laryngospasm).",

Bromocriptine is not indicated for the treatment of acute dystonic reactions.",

He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

Employing strategies that aim to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and therapeutic alliance, such as scheduling frequent follow-up visits, and a patient-centered approach often improve patients' medication adherence. Frequent follow-up visits also enable closer monitoring of the patient's medication use. Other strategies to improve medication adherence include providing written instructions, optimizing the treatment plan (e.g., prescribing once-daily scheduled medications when possible), and using the teach-back method.",

Older adults, especially those with dementia, are at increased risk for abuse. Older adult abuse is most commonly perpetrated by caregivers (e.g., spouse, nursing home staff) and can be physical, psychological, or financial, or take the form of neglect. Physicians are legally and ethically obligated to report suspected abuse. When a physician suspects abuse, they should privately speak with the affected patient, ask for further information, and offer assistance.\n\nFinally, this patient's decreased MCV and hemoglobin are consistent with microcytic anemia (e.g., due to insufficient iron intake) but do not indicate an increased bleeding risk.",

He is convinced that his female classmates at the community college he attends are secretly laughing at his scrawny appearance. Over the course of the semester, he has attended fewer and fewer classes out of embarrassment and shame. He is also concerned that his hair is thinning and applies topical minoxidil to his scalp 3 times daily. He spends 2 hours daily anxiously examining himself in the mirror. Today, he is wearing a long-sleeved shirt and a hat. His BMI is 26 kg/m^2. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

        "explanation_why": "Sleep restriction can be used in patients with chronic insomnia to reduce sleep latency. This intervention is characterized by deliberate, controlled limitation of the time spent in bed to the patient's estimated average sleep time in an attempt to consolidate fragmented sleep and decrease sleep latency. The physician's recommendations are not aimed to restrict the total time spent in bed. Instead, the physician's instructions describe a more specific behavioral intervention to associate the patient's bedroom with sleep.",

She has not responded to therapy with several disease-modifying agents and has required at least two pulse corticosteroid therapies every year. She has seen several specialists and sought out experimental therapies. During this time period, her disease course has been rapidly progressive. She currently requires a wheelchair and is incontinent. Today, she says, “I'm not going to allow myself to hope because I'll only be disappointed, like I have been over and over again.

Nephrogenic DI is the most common complication of long-term use of lithium, the first-line mood stabilizer for patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium is believed to cause nephrogenic DI by interfering with ADH signaling in the collecting duct cells, which results in reduced expression of water channel aquaporin-2 in these cells.",

This impairs the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine and results in the production of large amounts of dilute urine (up to 15 L/day).",

Polydipsia, polyuria, hypernatremia, and a low urine osmolality would not be expected. SCCs of the lung can secrete PTHrP, which can, in turn, result in hypercalcemia with subsequent neuropsychiatric disturbances and nephrogenic DI, which this patient has. However, the neuropsychiatric disturbance would usually be acute or subacute, unlike this patient's chronic psychiatric disorder.

He quit his job 1 year ago and stopped attending social events because his frequent urination has been disruptive. He spends most of his time at the library trying to learn what could be causing his symptoms. He would like to undergo a CT scan of his entire body to evaluate for cancer. Physical examination and laboratory studies show no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation.

Similarly, the odds of patients without seizures having a history of MDD is 35  (= b) divided by 70 (= d). The odds ratio of exposure is calculated as: (a/c) / (b/d) = ad/bc = (20*70)/(35*16) = 2.5. Based on this study, the odds of a patient with an unprovoked seizure having a history of MDD is 2.5 times higher when compared to patients without seizures.\n\nThe odds of an unprovoked seizure in a patient with MDD, i.e., event odds (disease odds), is the ratio of the number of patients with MDD who develop an unprovoked seizure (a = 20) to the number of patients with MDD who did not develop an unprovoked seizure (b = 35). Similarly, the odds of a seizure in a patient without MDD is 16 (= c) divided by 70 (= d). Consequently, the odds ratio of disease is calculated as: (a/b) / (c/d) = ad/bc = (20*70)/(35*16) = 2.5.

Her boyfriend says that, during this period, she has slept and eaten very little and has been unable to focus at work. She says that she feels “empty inside” and has been hearing voices telling her that she is worthless. She first heard these voices 7 months ago when they started to make fun of her. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is slow and monotonous; she abruptly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them. She occasionally directs her attention to the ceiling as if she were listening to someone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Displacement is a neurotic defense mechanism in which the affected individual redirects negative emotions about one person to a neutral third party (i.e., person or object), which is often a subordinate or less threatening entity. An example of displacement would be if the biochemist yelled at an intern for not showing enough initiative after having received negative feedback himself. In this case, the biochemist attributes emotions he has about himself to another person (his wife), which is better described by a different defense mechanism.",

    "hint": "To answer this question correctly, first calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) (i.e., the number of individuals that must be treated for one person to benefit from treatment), which is the inverse of absolute risk reduction (1/ARR). Then, as the second step, consider that the question asks for the number of persons who would benefit if 200 patients were treated!",

In this study, the ARR is the risk in the placebo group, 350 / (350 + 1050) = 0.25, minus the risk in the losartan group, 300 / (300 + 1200) = 0.20. Thus, the ARR = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05. The NNT is therefore 1/0.05 = 20 patients. However, the question asks how many deaths will be prevented if 200 patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction < 30% were treated with losartan in addition to an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker.",

In this case, stratification by biological sex revealed that asthma was a significant predictor of MI risk in females, but not in males. Thus, there is an interaction between asthma and biological sex that may have gone unnoticed if males and females were analyzed together.\n\nEffect modification is distinct from confounding, but they are often confused. Stratification by the variable in question would not reveal a difference between groups if the variable was a simple confounder.",

This apparent benefit results from a higher detection rate of disease (rather than a true delay of death) that is longer in duration but lower in severity. Patients with aggressive forms of a disease develop the disease and die within a timespan that is shorter than the screening interval and may never be screened. Length-time bias thus affects the measured survival, not incidence, of disease.",

An observation period of 8 years is unlikely to be long enough to observe a statistically significant difference in rates of mesothelioma between those exposed and those not exposed to asbestos. Malignancies and other chronic diseases typically have very long latency periods. It can therefore take years to study disease pathogenesis and the influence of factors that may modify the risk (e.g., a new treatment). Infectious diseases, on the other hand, have a very short latent period (incubation period).",

Since the relative risk of developing diabetes among those exposed to clozapine compared to those in the haloperidol group (not exposed) is  (30/300) / (21/300) ≈ 1.43, the attributable risk percent is thus approximately (1.43-1) / 1.43 = 0.30, or 30%.

The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers of children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers of children without developmental disorders. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01).

The chimpanzee solves the puzzle when he is able to place a set of wooden blocks sequentially inside the next biggest block. When a puzzle is solved successfully, a 30-second audio clip of a pop song plays. 15 seconds after that, a tangerine drops into the chimpanzee's room. After 2 days of this regimen, the chimpanzee undergoes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of his brain while hearing the audio clip, which shows markedly elevated neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra.

The UCS is repeatedly paired with a neutral stimulus, i.e., the pop song, eventually leading to the response by itself.

Support groups are one of the best ways for patients with chronic illness to connect with other people who have undergone similar experiences and to get information about their conditions. Attending a support group can help reduce feelings of isolation and build a sense of community. Patients with cystic fibrosis should avoid direct contact with other affected individuals to prevent cross-infection. While in-person support groups hold the risk of transmission of harmful bacteria between patients, virtual support groups are a reasonable alternative that is preferred in these patients.\n\nKeep in mind that multiple choice exams ask for the single best answer, which is particularly challenging with statement-type answer options. In clinical practice, there is usually more than one correct way to reply to a patient. In exams, it is important to identify the answer choice with the most correct information, even if you prefer different wording.",

The left ventricular obstruction in HOCM, however, typically results in a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur rather than a mid-to-late systolic murmur, which is heard in this patient. Moreover, the combination of hypothermia, bradycardia, low body weight, and dry, scaly skin suggests a different diagnosis.",

Furthermore, autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto disease) is associated with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which is likely present here. MVP may, in turn, predispose individuals to arrhythmias and syncope. However, hypothyroidism typically manifests with weight gain despite poor appetite.

While this patient has features of dehydration (e.g., dry mucous membranes, hypotension), which is an independent risk factor for heat exhaustion, her low core body temperature rules out heat exhaustion. Moreover, patients with heat exhaustion or dehydration are typically tachycardic.

An acute amphetamine overdose can cause loss of consciousness due to seizures or arrhythmias. Chronic amphetamine use can result in low body weight (due to appetite suppression), irritability, and features of dilated cardiomyopathy, such as an apical, systolic murmur due to functional mitral regurgitation (MR). The murmur associated with MR, however, is typically holosystolic. Moreover, an acute amphetamine overdose usually manifests with tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia rather than bradycardia, hypotension, and hypothermia, which are seen here. While tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia may be absent in the case of chronic use as a result of drug tolerance, chronic amphetamine use would not explain this patient's dry, scaly skin or anemia.",

        "explanation_why": "Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder in which (typically young and female) individuals severely restrict caloric intake because of a distorted body image and an intense fear of weight gain. Excessive exercise is commonly seen in this disorder. In addition to low body weight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m^2), severe caloric restriction leads to a variety of clinical features (e.g., hypothermia, secondary amenorrhea, osteoporosis, dry skin, pancytopenia, electrolyte abnormalities), some of which are seen here. Cardiovascular manifestations include sinus bradycardia, mitral valve prolapse, and hypotension, all of which can lead to syncope. Treatment includes nutritional rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and, in the case of underlying depression or anxiety, SSRIs.",

Bradycardia, which can lead to lightheadedness and syncope, may be a sign of increased intracranial pressure due to an intracranial tumor (e.g., brain metastases). However, this patient does not have other features that suggest increased intracranial pressure, such as altered mental status, headache, and/or blurry vision. The presence of hypothermia, dry, scaly skin, and an apical systolic murmur suggest a different diagnosis.",
        "explanation_but": "Damage to the hypothalamus by a tumor can also cause hypothermia, which can result in bradycardia. Severe marantic endocarditis, which can be caused by adenocarcinomas, can also cause an apical murmur if the mitral valve is affected. However, both these scenarios are extremely rare; a different diagnosis is much more likely in this patient.",

He says, “Please help me, I don't want to die.” He has experienced several similar episodes over the past 2 months, which occurred without warning in situations including open spaces or crowds and resolved gradually after 10 to 20 minutes. He has been staying at home as much as possible out of fear of triggering another episode. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He drinks 2 bottles of beer daily. He appears anxious and has a flushed face. His pulse is 104/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?",

    "hint": "This patient's history of 10–20 minute episodes of palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, and fear of dying that occur in both crowded and open spaces is suggestive of panic attacks. The presence of recurrent panic attacks for ≥ 1 month with behavior modification due to fear of subsequent episodes is consistent with panic disorder.",

While benzodiazepines are useful for the short-term management of panic attacks, they should not be used long-term because of the high potential for addiction and the development of tolerance. For long-term management, cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment, followed by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if pharmacotherapy is necessary.",

While NPH can manifest with dementia and urinary incontinence, this patient has no gait disturbance, which is characteristic for NPH. Moreover, in NPH, pharmacotherapy would be preceded by removal of small amounts of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture to alleviate symptoms and support the diagnosis.",

The width of the confidence interval is an indicator of the uncertainty in the estimator statistic (in this case, the mean IQ). Smaller study populations are more subject to the effects of chance, leading to less precision in the estimate of the mean which manifests as a wider confidence interval. In contrast, increasing the sample size will mitigate the effects of chance, providing a more precise estimate of the true mean that manifests as a narrower confidence interval (decreased range).",

It is dependent on the variability (i.e., standard deviation) of the measured values (in this case, IQ scores) and the sample size (SEM = SD/√n). By increasing the sample size, the sample means approach the true population mean, resulting in a smaller SEM. In contrast, a greater standard deviation and/or a smaller sample size will increase the SEM, resulting in a less accurate estimate. The SEM is commonly used to calculate confidence intervals that indicate, with a given level of confidence, the range of values within which the true mean of the underlying population falls.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the standard deviation and the SEM. The standard deviation is a measure of the variability of a sample, whereas the SEM is a measure of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean.",

A simple example would be trying to estimate the mean body weight of a population using an incorrectly calibrated scale (e.g., one that consistently shows a weight 3 lb less than the true weight). A change in sample size would not predispose to this type of error. Random error, on the other hand, is inherent in any sample statistic that estimates a true population parameter.

They have marked sedative effects, similarly to benzodiazepines, but are less effective as anticonvulsants and anxiolytics due to their receptor specificity. Nonbenzodiazepines can be effective for treating sleep-onset insomnia and/or sleep maintenance insomnia, depending on their half-life. Zaleplon has a very short half-life (∼ 1 hour), making it a suitable agent for this patient. Because of their risk of dependence and abuse potential, they should only be considered for short-term use and at the lowest possible dosage.\n\nFurther options for pharmacological treatment of sleep-onset insomnia include melatonin, ramelteon, suvorexant, and short-acting benzodiazepines.",

        "explanation_why": "Antipsychotic-induced pseudoparkinsonism is generally treated with dose reduction or discontinuation of the offending drug. However, if this does not suffice or is not feasible due to active psychotic illness, pharmaceutical treatment should be initiated to provide symptomatic relief. Centrally-acting muscarinic antagonists, e.g., benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, are the preferred treatment for pseudoparkinsonism associated with antipsychotic drugs in most patients. Elderly patients, however, should be treated with amantadine to avoid the potential anticholinergic side effects of muscarinic antagonists (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive impairments, delirium).",

All cases in which the graft survives past this point are part of this first group. The probability of survival to 10 years is given as 64% (probability of event “A” + “B”). The conditional probability is therefore 64 divided by 90 (i.e., 64/90), which is approx. 0.71, or 71%.",

Neurological examination shows horizontal nystagmus. Her gait is wide-based with small steps. Her hemoglobin concentration is 9.1 g/dL. A peripheral blood smear mean shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Homocysteine levels are elevated. Methylmalonic acid levels are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely direct cause of this patient's anemia?",

Folate deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia and is associated with increased MCV, hypersegmented neutrophils, increased homocysteine levels, and normal methylmalonic acid levels. The ataxia, nystagmus, and confusion in this patient can be explained by acute intoxication, alcohol-induced cerebellar atrophy, and/or Wernicke encephalopathy.",

Confusion may also occur in longterm deficiency. However, vitamin E deficiency usually manifests with hemolytic anemia, and this patient has no signs of hemolysis (e.g., jaundice, dark urine). In addition, it would not cause hypersegmented neutrophils.

However, opioid intoxication would typically manifest with bradypnea that is more pronounced than what is seen in this patient, as well as with hypotension, hypothermia, and possibly seizures. Moreover, miosis would typically be seen on physical examination, rather than the normal pupils observed here.",

In addition to features of sympathetic overactivity, acute cocaine overdose can also cause hallucinations (including tactile hallucinations such as formication) and paranoid ideation. Benzodiazepines are used to treat acute cocaine overdose and alpha-1 blockers (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) are recommended to treat the associated hypertension. The use of beta blockers, especially nonselective beta blockers, in suspected cocaine overdose is controversial due to concerns about unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which can worsen hypertension and coronary vasospasm. Chronic use of cocaine can cause nasal septal perforation (if used intranasally), periportal hepatitis, acute pulmonary toxicity and crack lung (if inhaled), myocarditis, and pulmonary artery hypertension.",

She claims that her boyfriend is “extremely selfish” and “does not care for her.” She says she feels lonely and wants her boyfriend to pay attention to her. Her boyfriend says that they have broken up 10 times in the past year because she is prone to outbursts of physical aggression as well as mood swings. He says that these mood swings last a few hours and can vary from states of “exuberance and affection” to states of “depression.” On examination, the patient appears well-dressed and calm. She has normal speech, thought processes, and thought content. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

A better endpoint measurement for screening tests is mortality rates between the screening groups, which minimizes this bias.",

She says her symptoms usually occur within a few blocks of her apartment but she can avoid a “full attack” if she can get home fast enough. Over the past year she has adjusted her life to avoid “attacks” by working from home, having her groceries delivered to her apartment, and having her friends and boyfriend come to her apartment to visit. She says she knows it's excessive, but she has to have her boyfriend accompany her when she leaves the house, otherwise she would be too afraid of being alone outside her home. Within a few hours after each episode, physical examination and laboratory studies have shown no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by an inordinate fear or anxiety surrounding situations that are perceived as difficult to leave or situations in which it might be difficult to seek help. These situations can trigger symptoms of a panic attack such as dyspnea, chest tightness, palpitations, dizziness, diaphoresis, and a feeling of impending doom. Individuals with agoraphobia actively avoid situations that could trigger these symptoms. This condition typically develops before 35 years of age, is more common among women, and has a strong hereditary component. Diagnosis requires the presence of symptoms over a period of ≥ 6 months in ≥ 2 of the following settings: areas outside the home (e.g., when going for a walk), open spaces (e.g., bridges, parking lots), enclosed places (e.g., stores, theaters), lines or crowds, or public transportation; the symptoms also must not be explained by other related conditions (e.g., social anxiety disorder).\n\nThe presence of symptoms in only one setting is consistent with a diagnosis of situational phobia (a type of specific phobia) rather than agoraphobia. Treatment of agoraphobia includes cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs.",

During the first therapy session, the patient recounts the numerous encounters that he had with his abuser. At the end of the session, the therapist, who lost her own son in a car accident when he was 15 years old, refuses to let the patient take the bus back alone to his custodial guardian's home. She offers to take him back in her own car instead, saying, “This way, I will rest assured that you have reached home safely”. The therapist's behavior can be best described as an instance of which of the following?",

His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness.

He spends most of his time alone in his room because he believes he is being followed by the Secret Service. He was fired from his job 3 months ago after threatening a colleague. He appears suspicious of his surroundings and asks the doctor questions about “the security of the hospital.” The patient exhibits a flat affect. During the physical examination, he tells the doctor that he recently bought a gun and says, “It's for protection. I only bought it to prevent people like my neighbor, who works for the Secret Service, from invading my property.” When asked if he plans to kill his neighbor, he replies, “I don't and I hope I won't have to. He usually tries to enter my house in the mornings, claiming he wants to bring my newspaper.” Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Most states have passed “Duty to Protect” laws, which allow a breach of patient confidentiality (by informing third parties as appropriate) or restriction of patient autonomy (through civil commitment) if there is potential for the patient to harm themselves or others. These laws require the health care provider to evaluate aspects such as the identity of the person at risk, imminence and certainty of the harm, and type of harm (e.g., physical harm, death) before making a decision. In this scenario, although the patient has expressed that he does not plan on hurting someone other than in self-defense, it is unclear if he can distinguish benign from hostile actions, and there is a potential threat to the neighbor's life if he brings him the newspaper again.\n\nThis patient should undergo evaluation for schizophrenia and, if the diagnosis is confirmed, receive antipsychotic treatment. Most patients with schizophrenia are treated on an outpatient basis, and it is better to have the patient voluntarily receive care before considering civil commitment. If this patient were to receive outpatient care (voluntarily or through community treatment orders), law enforcement authorities should be informed so that they can warn the person at risk (e.g., the neighbor of the potential risk of going near the patient's house). Law enforcement authorities (e.g., judicial magistrate) should also be notified after involuntary admission.",

In a real-life scenario, it might be appropriate to confront a colleague in private before or in addition to reporting them.

Reporting a colleague who is impaired and/or has a potential substance use disorder to the local PHP is the most appropriate action by the resident, as it is her ethical duty to protect patients from harm. In addition to this ethical duty, there are also legal requirements, especially if impairment is strongly suspected (e.g., if there is reasonable evidence or impairment has been witnessed first-hand). The laws and exact wording vary from state to state and physicians should be familiar with the requirements of their state of practice.\n\nThe PHP is supervised by the state medical board and aims to prevent, detect, and manage disorders that cause physician impairment. After the PHP receives a report, which can be submitted anonymously, a thorough assessment of the potentially impaired physician is performed. If impairment is confirmed, management options are offered; the PHP is not obliged to notify the state medical board about the impaired physician's condition if the physician voluntarily accepts treatment. If the physician refuses treatment, the PHP will report the physician's condition to the state medical board, which may lead to an involuntary referral for treatment and disciplinary action. After treatment, the PHP monitors the physician with regular assessments and/or laboratory tests for 1–5 years depending on the condition underlying the impairment.",

Abdominal examination shows a palpable bladder that is tender to palpation. A pelvic ultrasound performed by the emergency department resident confirms the diagnosis of acute urinary retention. An attempt to perform transurethral catheterization is unsuccessful. A urology consultation is ordered and the urologist plans to attempt suprapubic catheterization. As the urologist is called to see a different emergency patient, she asks the emergency department resident to obtain informed consent for the procedure. The resident recalls a lecture about the different modes of catheterization, but he has never seen or performed a suprapubic catheterization himself. Which of the following statements by the emergency department resident is the most appropriate?",

The use of opioid analgesics is appropriate for this patient with worsening pain. Many patients on hospice care use long-acting opioid analgesics, which are associated with a higher risk of developing respiratory depression compared to short-acting formulations.",

She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump and scheduled doses of intravenous hydromorphone. The on-duty physician increases the dose of the scheduled intravenous hydromorphone and then signs out to the covering physician, letting the covering physician know the names of his patients, their locations, and the reasons for their admissions. Overnight, the patient continues to report uncontrolled pain. The covering physician decides to get some sleep in case he has a busy night. He is awoken during the night by one of the nurses, who informs him about the patient's pain. The covering physician orders a one-time dose of intravenous hydromorphone. Shortly after the ward nurse administers the dose, the patient becomes confused, and her respirations decrease to 10/min. Physical examination shows constricted pupils and decreased bowel sounds. An iatrogenic opioid overdose is suspected. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this medical error?",

Miscommunication during patient handoffs can ultimately result in errors that compromise patient safety. In this scenario, there was a change in the patient's medications (i.e., the increased dose of scheduled intravenous hydromorphone) that was not communicated to the covering physician. As a result, the patient received an inappropriate dose of additional intravenous hydromorphone, which led to an iatrogenic opioid overdose. Standardized handoffs (e.g., using checklists) have been shown to reduce the incidence of preventable medical errors. A proper handoff in this scenario should also include information about the patient's current medications (e.g., drug, route, amount, frequency, effectiveness), recent changes to management, and explicit suggestions for anticipated concerns (e.g., what to administer for this patient if she continues to have uncontrolled pain).\n\nIn patient handoffs, it is also important for the on-call physician to receive information on the patient's diagnoses, code status, a summary of the hospital course, and tasks to complete, and for there to be two-way communication between the physicians performing the handoff.",

In patients in early puberty, however, puberty suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics is indicated before gender-affirming hormone therapy, which is typically initiated between 13 and 16 years of age.

However, this is an irreversible physical intervention and should only be performed after other steps have been taken. Specifically, surgery can be considered after completion of at least one year of fully reversible hormone therapy and after reaching the legal age to give consent for medical procedures.

However, gender identity is established around 3 years of age; experimentation and exploration of a gender identity that does not conform to the sex assigned at birth and that persistently extends into puberty is unlikely to subside and patients should not delay appropriate care, as this may result in severe psychosocial consequences.",

The patient stopped going to swim class due to “feeling uncomfortable in swim trunks.” The patient's mother, who is accompanying the patient, reports that her child has been wearing her dresses at home and asks to be called Lilly. Since starting puberty about a year ago, the patient has stayed at home most of the time, only rarely meeting friends. The patient's academic performance has been poor for the last year despite having maintained an A average the year before. The mother further reports that her child has had mainly female friends since preschool and never enjoyed playing with “typical boy toys like cars” but instead preferred playing with dolls. The patient appears shy and in a depressed mood. Physical examination shows normal male external genitalia. There is scarce coarse, dark axillary and pubic hair. Upon questioning, the patient says “I am trapped in a male body. It just doesn't feel right to be a boy.” Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

In relation to HIV infection, the use of condoms, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV postexposure prophylaxis, and antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission are examples of recommendations that belong to the same category as that of the recommendation provided to this patient.",

In medicine, this bias can lead to diagnostic errors, e.g., when certain evidence is emphasized or left out. Framing bias is understood as an error due to inheriting someone else's thinking.",

        "explanation_why": "The availability bias describes a tendency to make judgments based on the availability of information in an individual's memory. Readily recalled information/events are believed to be more relevant and representative, whereas information that comes to mind less promptly is perceived as less likely to be true. In medicine, the availability bias typically occurs when a physician picks a diagnosis that comes to mind easily and quickly, e.g., when several patients with a similar clinical presentation were recently diagnosed with a certain condition. The availability bias often results in the correct diagnosis being made, but it can also result in diagnostic errors, as seen here.",

He is diagnosed with a thrombotic stroke and treatment with aspirin is initiated. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study is performed to determine his ability to swallow safely; he is found to be at increased risk of aspiration. Consequently, he is ordered not to have any food or liquids by mouth. A Dobhoff feeding tube is placed, tube feedings are ordered, and the patient starts receiving tube feedings. Shortly after, he develops a cough and dyspnea. An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the right lower lobe and that the end of the Dobhoff tube is in his right lung instead of his stomach. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this medical error from occurring?",

LSD is a hallucinogenic drug that primarily works by activating 5-HT_2A receptors in the CNS. Vivid visual hallucinations and/or illusions, synesthesia, and distorted time perception are characteristic effects of LSD use, but patients can also experience anxiety, agitation, and paranoid delusions (a “bad trip”). In addition, LSD has mild sympathomimetic effects (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis). Treatment consists of supportive care and reassurance. If needed, antipsychotics may be given for psychosis and benzodiazepines for anxiety.\n\nSymptoms of hallucinogen intoxication typically resolve spontaneously after 6–12 hours. Long-term complications include persistent psychosis and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.",

The annual risk of developing TD from first-generation antipsychotic use is up to 25% among older adults while the annual risk associated with second-generation antipsychotic use is ∼ 5%. Symptoms often persist despite discontinuation of the offending drug. Vesicular monoamine transporter-2 inhibitors (e.g., valbenazine, deutetrabenazine) can be used to treat moderate to severe TD. Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., benztropine) can exacerbate symptoms, as seen in this patient.",

However, symptoms of this condition typically develop in the fourth or fifth decade of life. In addition, this patient does not have other typical features of Huntington disease, including hyperreflexia, sensory deficits, and autonomic disturbances. This patient's history of chronic use of a first-generation antipsychotic indicates another diagnosis.",

In this case, the physician should politely decline while explaining their concerns and help the friend to find a more appropriate physician.",

Ever since you prescribed me these pills, my breasts hurt almost every day and it is taking a toll on my relationship; my boyfriend can't even get near me.” She has no family history of breast cancer. Breast examination shows mild bilateral diffuse tenderness and no masses. There is no redness, swelling, or warmth of the breasts. The physician apologizes for her pain and explains the risks and benefits of alternative methods of contraception. When the physician suggests a copper intrauterine device, the patient seems unsure. The patient says she does not want to use nonhormonal alternatives because they are too unsafe. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

    "question_text": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the family physician for a routine health maintenance examination. The patient and her family, including her mother and father, have all been in the physician's care for the past 20 years, and the patient regularly accompanies her parents to their appointments. During the examination, the patient mentions that she is concerned that her 70-year-old father has recently bought a parcel of land and now wants to build a new home on it. Her father worked as a contractor for 30 years before going into retirement and plans to build the house himself with only minor help from other contractors. The patient explains that she is worried her father will injure himself while working on the house and “dig himself into a financial hole.” She asks the physician whether he could speak to her father about his plans and explain to him that these would be too much of a physical and financial risk for a person of his age. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement by the physician at this time?",

The patient and her family, including her mother and father, have all been in the physician's care for the past 20 years, and the patient regularly accompanies her parents to their appointments. During the examination, the patient mentions that she is concerned that her 70-year-old father has recently bought a parcel of land and now wants to build a new home on it. Her father worked as a contractor for 30 years before going into retirement and plans to build the house himself with only minor help from other contractors. The patient explains that she is worried her father will injure himself while working on the house and “dig himself into a financial hole.” She asks the physician whether he could speak to her father about his plans and explain to him that these would be too much of a physical and financial risk for a person of his age.

Her current medications include warfarin and metoprolol. One month ago, her primary care physician increased the dose of warfarin because of subtherapeutic coagulation studies. A repeat coagulation study was ordered for the following week. Today, the physician realizes that the test results were sent back to the office 18 days ago and show a prothrombin time of 43 seconds (INR = 4.0).

        "explanation_why": "Critical test results, which require an immediate review by a physician (e.g., high PT/INR, derangements in potassium levels), can be labeled as “urgent” in order to bring these results to the attention of the caregiver sooner and thereby help prevent a delay in follow-up. However, this measure can only be implemented successfully by trained personnel (e.g., physicians, laboratory technicians, nurses); office front staff are not trained to identify critical test results; if they are instructed to label all abnormal test results as “urgent,” alert fatigue can occur and cause the physician to ignore the “urgent” label.",

        "explanation_why": "Standardization of protocols for the follow-up of test results (e.g., maintaining a record of therapeutic drug monitoring tests that need to be reviewed, or a record of tests with pending results) can help prevent medical errors that occur as a result of a delay in follow-up by the physician. Protocols help ensure a consistent level of quality and increase efficiency (e.g., reduce the variation in follow-up time and increase the likelihood of the physician reviewing critical test results as soon as they arrive). By using a standardized protocol, the physician would have been notified that the patient's INR was too high earlier, could have adjusted the warfarin dose in time, and thereby have prevented the anal bleeding.\n\nFurther examples of standardization include the introduction of checklists and guidelines as well as standardized equipment and terminology.",

However, several patient-related factors (e.g., lack of internet access, low literacy level, low motivation, inability to interpret test results), and design-related factors (e.g., poor ease-of-use) can limit the usefulness of these portals. Moreover, this step does not address the physician's responsibility to follow up on the patient's results in a timely manner and lays this responsibility squarely on the patient.",

Patients with trichotillomania often have an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depressive disorder. Trichotillomania is more common in women than men and manifests most commonly in teenagers, although it can occur at any age, particularly in the setting of multiple stressors. Hair-pulling can occur at the scalp, as seen in this patient, as well as eyebrows and eyelashes. The first-line treatment for trichotillomania is cognitive behavioral therapy, specifically habit reversal training (HRT). SSRIs may be used if there is coexisting OCD, anxiety, or depression, but the evidence for SSRIs in trichotillomania alone is limited.",

During the examination, he tells the physician that he has been having marital issues with his wife. He filed for bankruptcy 2 months ago for a business he had owned with his brother until his brother died of skin cancer a year ago. He has tried to hide his financial issues from his wife and explains that he is feeling increasingly desperate and no longer “sees the light at the end of the tunnel.” He worries about finances and what would happen if he developed cancer like his brother, and then cannot fall asleep. In the morning, he feels tired and finds it hard to start the day. The patient says the symptoms began a few months after his brother's death and then, “Everything started to fall apart. I can't concentrate, my wife will probably leave me soon, and now I have lost the business.” Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction by the physician?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Through this reaction, the physician shows empathy and specifically asks about suicidal ideation. Assessing a patient's suicide risk is the most important diagnostic step for any depressed individual. If the patient confirms that he is having suicidal ideation, the physician should also ask the patient if he has thought of a means of suicide (suicidal plan), assess the degree to which he intends to put the plan into action (suicidal intent), and evaluate whether additional risk factors for suicide completion are present (e.g., possession of a firearm, personal and family history of prior suicide attempts). If the patient is suicidal, they should be admitted to the hospital. Treatment of a major depressive episode often requires a combination of antidepressants, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.",

Although it could be normal for the patient to occasionally have some of his symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, decreased sleep, decreased concentration) as a part of grief, it is not normal to have them on a persistent basis or have unexplained weight loss over 8 months. Moreover, by saying, “You will see that things will become easier for you over time!\" the physician is making promises that cannot be guaranteed.",

However, the symptoms of grief tend to occur in waves (grief pangs), decrease over time, and are not associated with functional impairment or feelings of desperation.

At the 24-month follow-up, the investigators find that a significant number of patients were not adherent with the treatment assigned or lost to follow-up. Nonetheless, results for the patients who completed the protocol showed that pomalidomide improves progression-free survival. The investigators are worried about potential biases resulting from the significant loss to follow-up and nonadherence in the treatment group.

This analysis includes data from all patients and preserves the original randomization, giving a more accurate estimate of the efficacy of the tested treatment and minimizing selection bias when compared to data analysis that excludes drop-out patients. In the described study, the large drop-out rate as a result of nonadherence and loss to follow-up may have created selection bias and the shown improvement of progression-free survival under pomalidomide may be falsely skewed in favor of the treatment.

Internal validity is likely unaffected by the blood pressure measurement, as both studies use calibrated sphygmomanometers from the same manufacturer. External validity refers to how applicable the study is to the general population; study B is more likely to exhibit higher external validity compared to study A, which involves Berkson bias. In study A, the actual prevalence of hypertension in the general population is less likely to be accurately reflected due to this bias. Therefore, study B is expected to have higher accuracy.",

When reliability is high, the data points are more close together.Validity refers to how close the data points are to the true value: when validity is low, the data points do not approximate the true value.",

One week ago, he was suspended from school after talking back to his teacher and preventing her from finishing the class. He also refused to wait outside the principal's office because he says, the principal “is stupid.” This was his 3^rd suspension in 8 months. He frequently argues with his parents and does not respect their curfews. They have tried grounding him, but he keeps escaping through the window at night and does not answer his phone. When his parents try to confront him, he loses his temper and starts screaming at them. During the interview, the patient refuses to answer and frequently disrupts the physician.

However, additional features, such as engaging in criminal activity, disregarding personal safety and/or the safety of others, and manipulating others would also be expected in ASPD, and none of these features are seen here. Moreover, while affected individuals may develop symptoms in adolescence, the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder cannot be made until the patient is 18 years of age.",

Last week, when his teacher asked him to present his homework in class, he started shouting and cursing and threw a book on the floor. The teacher has reported that similar outbursts occur at least twice weekly for no apparent reason; otherwise, he is usually calm and sits quietly during class. His mother reports that during driving lessons he regularly becomes angry “if other people drive too slowly”, and that has led to him almost losing control of the car. After these episodes, he feels embarrassed and apologizes for his actions. When asked about his behavior in these situations, he says, “I feel a sudden rage inside of me, my mind is racing, and I can feel my heart pounding.” His mother is concerned that he may not be able to get his driver's license if he cannot control himself. He is otherwise healthy, takes no medications, and does not use illicit drugs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

When asked about his behavior in these situations, he says, “I feel a sudden rage inside of me, my mind is racing, and I can feel my heart pounding.” His mother is concerned that he may not be able to get his driver's license if he cannot control himself. He is otherwise healthy, takes no medications, and does not use illicit drugs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

DMDD typically manifests before 10 years of age and outbursts usually occur ≥ 3 times weekly. Unlike this patient, individuals with DMDD typically remain persistently irritable between outbursts of aggression and do not usually express feelings of remorse or embarrassment after episodes.",

Alternatively, diagnosis is established if the outbursts occur ≥ 3 times a year with injury to others or destruction of property. The peak age of onset for intermittent explosive disorder is 14–17 years. Treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy (e.g., SSRIs). Affected individuals are at increased risk for self-harm and may continue to experience aggressive episodes throughout life.\n\nA urine toxicology screen should be obtained to rule out drug-induced etiologies of aggression. For children 6–18 years of age in whom a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder is suspected, adjustment disorder should also be excluded.",

Recently, he started blinking more frequently for no apparent reason. In the past, he would repeatedly twist his neck, often for several minutes at a time. He has also been copying gestures and sounds that others do since 6 years of age. She reports that the movements worsen when he is tired. When asked about the blinking, he says, “Sometimes I suddenly feel like I must blink and, when I do, I feel much better.” He does not take any medications and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 80^th percentile for height and weight. On physical examination, the boy continues to blink excessively. The conjunctiva is clear and pupils are equal and reactive to light. When the physician asks the boy to keep his eyes open, the blinking subsides. During the examination, the boy repeats some of the words of the physician at increasing speed, but he is otherwise alert and oriented. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

TS characteristically has a waxing and waning nature, with exacerbation of symptoms occurring during times of stress or fatigue. Tics are commonly preceded by an urge or sensation that is relieved by the tic itself and are often suppressible. Management includes counseling for the patient and caregivers and behavioral therapy, including Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) and habit reversal training. Pharmacotherapy is indicated in severe or refractory cases and includes alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., guanfacine, clonidine), first-generation neuroleptics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine), second-generation neuroleptics (e.g., risperidone), and dopamine depleters (e.g., tetrabenazine). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an alternative therapy reserved for patients with severe, distressing tics refractory to behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy.",

The patient was arrested by the police after he was found running naked in the streets at night and talking to his “fellow prophets.” His girlfriend reports that he has not slept for over a week, although he reports feeling “great and refreshed.” She says that he recently disrupted a family wedding by announcing that he had invested all his and his girlfriend's money in shares of a spacecraft company in order to fund his presidential campaign. The patient's girlfriend also says that he has been overly active for the last 10 days, constantly walking back and forth and talking with sweeping gesticulations. Three weeks ago, his mother died from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. He has a history of major depressive disorder but has not had a depressive episode for more than a year. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, his speech is pressured, he is easily distractible, and he tells many anecdotes.

In addition to meeting the criteria for a manic episode, this patient has a history of major depressive disorder, which is supportive of bipolar I disorder, though not necessary for the diagnosis. In bipolar I disorder, mood changes may be accompanied by mood-congruent psychotic symptoms, as seen in this patient (auditory hallucinations as suggested by his talking to the “fellow prophets”). Any stressor (e.g., the death of the patient's mother) can trigger a mood episode (e.g., mania, major depressive episode) in bipolar I disorder. An acute manic episode is a psychiatric emergency and requires immediate management, including assessment of suicidal behavior and treatment with a mood stabilizer and/or an atypical antipsychotic, depending on the severity of the manic episode.\n\nTo remember the features of a manic episode, think “DIG FAST”: D = Distractibility, I = Irresponsibility, G = Grandiosity, F = Flight of ideas, A = Activity increase, S = Sleep deficit, T = Talkativeness.",

Her husband reports that she refuses to eat, often stays awake at night, and has lost 7 kg (15 lb) over the past month. He says that her symptoms began after the death of her estranged son 2 months ago. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and pacemaker implantation 5 years ago. Her current medications include metformin, lisinopril, clopidogrel, and temazepam. She appears fatigued and emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 142/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-healed midline scar over the sternum. A pacemaker is palpable below the left clavicle. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and a tearful affect. When asked about active suicidal ideation, she says in a soft voice, “It is not worth living anymore. My son is dead because I failed to reconcile with him. He is saying that my death will make him happy.” Laboratory studies including thyroid function tests, serum electrolyte concentrations, and a 24-hour urine cortisol concentration are within reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Elderly patients with MDD such as this woman frequently have multiple contraindications to psychiatric drugs or do not tolerate them well, making ECT preferred in this population. Furthermore, elderly patients with MDD are more responsive to ECT compared to pharmacotherapy and improve quicker than younger patients after ECT. Other indications for ECT include MDD in pregnant women, MDD refractory to pharmacotherapy, schizophrenia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. There are no absolute contraindications for ECT and it is safe in patients with pacemakers and other automatic implantable devices.",

He noticed that the trembling increases after drinking coffee, and since then he has begun restricting his consumption of caffeinated beverages. He also has mild nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea. One month ago, the patient was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after developing a manic episode and was hospitalized for treatment with lithium. The manic symptoms resolved with pharmacotherapy and he was discharged after 2 weeks. He has not had any difficulty with his activities of daily living since his discharge. The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and two major depressive episodes. His mother died by suicide when he was 5 years old. The patient smokes one pack of cigarettes per week and does not drink alcohol. Current medications are insulin and lithium. The patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination does not show any abnormal movements at rest. When the patient is asked to extend his arms in front of his body, a fine tremor is seen in the hands and fingers bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A fingerstick glucose test shows no abnormalities. Serum lithium concentration is 0.5 mEq/L (N = 0.4–1.0).

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Approx. 25% of patients on lithium develop a symmetric, nonprogressive, fine (approx. 10 Hz) postural tremor in the distal ends of the upper extremities. This type of tremor typically occurs when lithium therapy is started or the dose is increased but can occur at any time during the course of treatment. Nausea is also a common side effect, occurring in 10–20% of patients on lithium.",

In this patient, however, the serum lithium concentration is in the low therapeutic range (0.40–0.60 mEq/L); a further decrease in the total daily lithium dose would impair therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, mild nausea and a postural tremor are side effects that can be managed by other means.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In many patients, both nausea and the lithium-induced postural tremor decrease over time; most cases are therefore managed conservatively with reassurance, avoidance of exacerbating factors (e.g., caffeine, stress), and follow-up. If the tremor persists, a reduction in the total daily dose of lithium (if serum lithium concentration is close to the upper limit of the therapeutic range), the use of short-acting lithium preparations, and/or divided doses (to reduce peak serum lithium concentrations) can be considered. If the tremor is severe or refractory to expectant management and dosage adjustment, beta blockers (e.g., propranolol), which are also used to treat other forms of postural tremors (e.g., essential tremor, physiologic tremor), can be used. If the tremor is progressive, coarse, irregular, affects parts of the body besides the upper limbs, and/or accompanies other symptoms (e.g., delirium, diarrhea, vomiting), lithium intoxication must be ruled out. Nausea can be reduced by advising the patient to take lithium during or immediately after meals, use of a sustained-release preparation of lithium, and/or divided doses.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for the lithium-induced postural tremor includes benign essential tremor, Parkinson disease, drug-induced parkinsonism (e.g., due to antipsychotic therapy, often used as an adjunct to a mood stabilizer during the acute manic episode), and metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypoglycemia).",

    "question_text": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his sister because of shortness of breath, chest tightness, palpitations, and sweaty hands for the past 30 minutes. His symptoms started when he was walking in the park with his sister. Over the past year, he has had several episodes with similar symptoms when using public transport and in crowded places. Since then, he avoids leaving his home and when he does, he says he feels safer when accompanied by his sister.

    "content_preview": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his sister because of shortness of breath, chest tightness, palpitations, and sweaty hands for the past 30 minutes. His symptoms started when he was walking in the park with his sister. Over the past year, he has had several episodes with similar symptoms when using public transport and in crowded places. Since then, he avoids leaving his home and when he does, he says he feels safer when accompanied by his sister.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by an inordinate fear or anxiety in situations that are perceived as difficult to leave or situations in which it might be difficult to seek help. These situations can trigger symptoms of a panic attack, such as dyspnea, chest tightness, palpitations, diaphoresis, and a feeling of impending doom. Individuals with agoraphobia actively avoid situations that might trigger these symptoms. This condition typically develops before 35 years of age, is more common among women, and has a strong hereditary component. Diagnosis requires the presence of symptoms over a period of ≥ 6 months in ≥ 2 of the following settings: areas outside the home when alone (e.g., going for a walk), open spaces (e.g., bridges, parking lots), enclosed spaces (e.g., stores, theaters), lines or crowds, and public transportation; the symptoms must not be explained by other related conditions (e.g., social anxiety disorder). First-line treatment of agoraphobia includes cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs.\n\nThe presence of symptoms in only one setting is consistent with a diagnosis of situational phobia (a specific phobia) rather than agoraphobia.",

The patient's only brother died of leukemia 10 days ago. The father says that since the funeral a week ago, the patient has stayed in her brother's room most of the time and only joined the parents for breakfast and dinner. She has not gone to school since her brother's death. She eats very little and stays awake most of the night. The father reports that he has heard her talking in her brother's room even though she was alone and her phone was on the kitchen table. At the dinner table, she asked if she could have two extra plates for her imaginary friends, “Anna and Joseph”. The patient says that she misses her brother a lot and that she feels tired and sad all the time. She does not have nightmares or flashbacks and remembers details of her brother's last days and the funeral. She denies suicidal ideations or feelings of guilt. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use drugs recreationally. Her only medication is a daily multivitamin. She appears calm and is attentive. Her speech is clear and organized. Her vital signs are within normal limits. During the examination, she suddenly turns to the side and says: “Yes, Joseph, this is a very good question, but wait until after the examination.” She then turns back to the physician and apologizes for the interruption. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The onset of symptoms is usually sudden (without a prodrome) and the functional impairment can be severe. After the episode, individuals gradually return to the premorbid state. Although this patient currently meets the diagnostic criteria for this condition, psychiatric diagnoses are dynamic, changing depending on the duration of symptoms and whether new symptoms arise.

            "description": "The binding of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to V2 receptors (R) promotes the insertion of aquaporin-2 channels into the apical cell membranes of principal cells in the renal collecting duct, thereby facilitating free water reabsorption and concentration of urine.In diabetes insipidus (DI), this mechanism is impaired either due to reduced pituitary ADH secretion (central DI) or defective renal ADH receptors (nephrogenic DI), in both cases reducing the insertion of aquaporin-2 channels. This impairs the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine and results in the production of large amounts of dilute urine (up to 15 L/day).",

Furthermore, both DKA and HHS are complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which is a possible diagnosis in this patient given the personal history of celiac disease, an autoimmune condition associated with T1DM, and the family history of T1DM. However, in both DKA and HHS, serum osmolality and urine osmolality are increased rather than decreased.",

        "explanation_why": "A very low dietary solute intake severely limits free water excretion and predisposes patients to developing hypotonic hyponatremia, even with normal levels of water intake. This condition, referred to as beer potomania syndrome, typically occurs in individuals with chronic alcohol use but can also occur in individuals with dietary restrictions. However, patients with this condition are typically malnourished; this patient's BMI of 25 kg/m^2 makes this condition unlikely. Moreover, polyuria and polydipsia are not reported as presenting symptoms, and low urine osmolality is usually not seen at initial presentation; polyuria and low urine osmolality typically occur only once solute intake is restored (results in brisk diuresis).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The combination of low serum osmolality and low urine osmolality indicates that vasopressin secretion is appropriately suppressed and the kidney's ability to dilute urine is intact. These findings also indicate that the primary cause of decreased serum osmolality is extravascular compartment dilution due to excessive water intake, which occurs in patients with primary polydipsia (PP, psychogenic polydipsia). This condition typically occurs in patients with psychiatric illnesses. Although the pathogenesis of this condition is not entirely understood, a central dysfunction of thirst regulation is thought to play an important role. On rare occasions, PP can also occur as a result of hypothalamic lesions that alter the thirst center's osmoregulatory setpoint (e.g., in neurosarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis). The serum osmolality and sodium concentrations of patients with this condition rapidly return to normal when limiting the water intake, as excess water is excreted by the kidney.\n\nSee “Primary polydipsia vs. central DI vs. nephrogenic DI” table.",

Patients with RAD also show minimal social responsiveness to others, which is reflected in this child's lack of involvement in cooperative play with other children. Repeated changes in foster care limit the opportunity to form selective attachments and are a risk factor for this condition. Other risk factors include child abuse and neglect. The diagnosis of RAD can only be made in children who are developmentally able to form selective attachments (i.e., at least 9 months old) and features of RAD must be evident before 5 years of age.",

        "explanation_why": "This middle-aged female patient presents with signs and symptoms indicating abnormalities in various systems: neuropsychiatric (features of psychosis), mucocutaneous (rash on sun-exposed skin, oral ulcers), hematologic (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), and cardiac (signs of acute pericarditis: high-pitched grating systolic sound, diffuse ST-segment elevations, PR-segment elevation with ST-segment depression in aVR). This multisystem involvement together with a false-positive VDRL (with negative FTA-ABS) raises suspicion for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's negative urine toxicology and reassuring electrolytes, glucose, liver, and thyroid function studies further support this diagnosis. In patients with symptoms suggestive of SLE, ANA titer screening is recommended. If the ANA titer is ≥ 1:80, patients can be evaluated according to the ACR classification criteria for SLE to support the diagnostic process. Other neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE include seizures and delirium. Management of SLE includes induction therapy with a systemic glucocorticoid and maintenance therapy with hydroxychloroquine with or without methotrexate or azathioprine.\n\nPatients taking an equivalent dose of ≥ 40 mg/day of prednisone are at increased risk for glucocorticoid-induced psychosis. Differentiating glucocorticoid-induced psychosis from neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE can be difficult. Glucocorticoid-induced psychosis tends to occur within 6 weeks of treatment initiation and resolves once glucocorticoids are discontinued.",

However, patients with PCT typically have fragile skin that blisters with sun exposure or trauma rather than mild eczematous eruptions like those seen in this patient. Healing of these lesions results in scarring and milia formation and can cause areas of hyper- and/or hypopigmentation. Furthermore, PCT commonly manifests with hepatic injury and transaminitis. Finally, pancytopenia, pericarditis, and psychotic features are not typical manifestations of PCT.",

They should also be involved in and encouraged to discuss all aspects of care (i.e., physical, psychosocial, spiritual). This should also apply in a palliative setting, where the goal is to relieve suffering and provide the best possible quality of life. Parental consent must be obtained before proceeding with any medical procedure (e.g., placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or treatment decision (e.g., transfer to hospice care). Disclosure to the child should be adapted according to age and developmental level.",

        "explanation_why": "Disclosure to a pediatric patient is essential for building a trusting therapeutic relationship. The decision of whether and how to explain the prognosis to a pediatric patient is highly individual and depends on the patient's cognitive development. Although preschoolers (< 6 years of age) are often unable to conceptualize death, it is important to help them understand their situation by giving simple and concrete information and with the help of trained specialists and creative approaches (e.g., music therapy, puppets). As children become more mature, their understanding of death develops and it may be appropriate for them to participate in medical decisions. Although this patient may benefit from disclosure about the prognosis of his condition, another aspect of palliative care should be addressed at this point.",

Two months ago, he was started on increasing doses of risperidone because of behavioral changes. His mother now reports that he has become increasingly suspicious of the mail carrier, who he believes is “a secret agent from the CIA who is spying on our family.” The patient has been hospitalized for similar episodes in the past. He is currently at the maximum dose of risperidone. Previous treatment with quetiapine was not effective. His mother reports that he has been living with her since he lost his job 3 months ago. His mother has seen him taking his medications regularly. Last month, his girlfriend left him after he attacked her because he believed that she was cheating on him. He used to smoke marijuana on a regular basis but stopped 1 year ago. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. He appears agitated. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he does not respond to any questions or instructions and continues to look to the left while nodding and smiling. Laboratory studies, including a urine toxicology screen, show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Clozapine is usually the first-line therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia because it is more effective than other antipsychotics. Clozapine is associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis. Therefore, the benefits and risks of treatment, as well as the patient's ability to adhere to treatment and follow-ups, must be weighed and discussed with the patient and their family. Before initiating clozapine, the leukocyte count and differential should also be assessed; regular monitoring is indicated during treatment. Patients should have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1500 cells/μL before beginning treatment with clozapine. Additionally, monitoring for adverse metabolic effects (e.g., weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) is also recommended since atypical antipsychotics also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome.",

He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Ten years ago, the patient was diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder after the death of his wife. Since then, his mental status has been stable. He lives alone and takes care of all his activities of daily living. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and drinks two glasses of wine daily. His current medication is metformin. Abdominal ultrasonography shows a pancreatic mass. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a suspicious mass in the head of the pancreas that is classified as unresectable. A needle biopsy specimen of the mass confirms a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. When the doctor wants to enter the patient's room to reveal the diagnosis to the patient, he is approached by the son who says, “If it's cancer, please don't tell him.” Which of the following is the most appropriate response from the physician?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Patient autonomy is one of the four core principles of medical ethics. When a patient's family or friends make a request for nondisclosure, it is critical to understand why the request has been made because this will inform physicians of how best to approach disclosure while respecting cultural differences or other concerns. Understanding the motivation behind such requests may also uncover explicit reasons not to tell the patient (e.g., grounds for invoking therapeutic privilege, patient preference to not know the diagnosis). Furthermore, it promotes rapport and a trusting relationship with the family. In most cases, cognitively intact patients should be informed of the diagnosis so that they can make appropriate medical decisions. Practical approaches to disclosing a sensitive diagnosis include understanding the patient's preference and incremental disclosure (SPIKES protocol).",

He recently enlisted in the US Army and started military training 2 weeks ago, but was not able to continue because his vision became severely blurry. He ambulates with a walking cane and wears dark glasses. He has no personal history of serious illness. His father has hyperopia. The patient appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Inspection of the eyes shows no abnormalities. Fundoscopy findings are normal. Snellen eye chart examination shows a visual acuity of 20/200 on the right and 20/100 on the left. When the physician suddenly passes a hand in front of the patient's eyes, he starts blinking. When asked to close his eyes, extend his hands, and touch the tip of his nose with his index finger, the patient touches his eyebrow and chin instead of his nose. The remainder of the neurologic examination is unremarkable. When asked to perform an additional perimetry test, the patient says “I'm really tired at this point and would really like to go home. I would really appreciate it if you could verify that I cannot see and that I cannot continue the military training.” In addition to acknowledging the patient's concerns, which of the following is the most appropriate action from the physician?",

    "hint": "This patient's physical examination findings (abnormal finger-to-nose test indicating a cerebellar condition, eye blinking as a response to a sudden hand wave indicating intact visual pathway) do not correlate with his presenting symptom (blurry vision) and additional examination findings (poor visual acuity indicating defective visual pathway). In combination with his request for a letter excusing him from military training, this should raise concern for malingering.",

However, this patient's presentation suggests that he is malingering, which is not a psychiatric disorder, but rather an intentional behavior motivated by an external reward (e.g., avoiding work, obtaining insurance money). It would be inappropriate to schedule follow-up meetings without addressing his malingering behavior.",

After the patient has calmed down or adequate sedation has been achieved, restraints should be removed immediately. Once the patient is no longer sedated, the physician should then reevaluate the underlying cause of the patient's behavior and decision-making capacity to determine whether she should be admitted or discharged. Admission is appropriate when imminent harm to one's self or others continues and/or if the patient is uncooperative, intoxicated, or demonstrates psychotic behavior. If the patient is no longer combative, the behavior was a result of intoxication, and medical examination finds no abnormalities, discharge is recommended.",

She does not speak English and asks her bilingual adult daughter to translate. Her hemoglobin A_1C is 9.1%. A physician notices that the average hemoglobin A_1C of patients with diabetes mellitus and limited English proficiency in the hospital is significantly higher when compared to patients proficient in English. The hospital conducts an inpatient study, which finds a statistically significant correlation between scores on a standardized verbal English proficiency test and scores on standardized medication adherence scales and patient-physician concordance scales. Based on the results of a subsequent root cause analysis, the hospital management renegotiates health care payment contracts with their insurance provider to allow for reimbursement of professional medical interpreter services. This intervention best addresses which of the following barriers to high-quality health care?",

Patients of all ethnicities, languages, and cultures can be affected by health illiteracy. Conversely, a patient with LEP can have a high level of health literacy in their native language. The use of professional medical interpreter services helps patients with LEP to receive information from health care providers in their native language but it does not address health illiteracy per se since the translated information can still be complex. Simplifying information (e.g., avoiding technical medical jargon, breaking down instructions into simple steps) is an intervention to improve health literacy.",

Identity devaluation can be corrected by systemic changes that increase intercultural understanding, such as hiring more bilingual physicians.

Neurocognitive testing shows he is alert and oriented to person and place but does not know the year or month. During the examination, the physician names three unrelated objects clearly and slowly.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Late initiation of prenatal care, missed appointments, medication nonadherence, multiple abortions, injuries of different ages, and frequent visits to the emergency department should raise suspicion for intimate partner violence (IPV), which often becomes more severe during pregnancy and the postpartum period.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Individuals experiencing IPV are at high risk of health impairment (e.g., injury, preterm birth, death) and should be provided with information about in-house and community resources (e.g., shelters). Risk factors for escalation should be evaluated (e.g., partner being abusive during pregnancy, victim attempting to leave their partner) and a safety plan should be established with the patient before they leave the office. This plan typically includes advising the patient to prepare an emergency kit that contains important items (e.g., documents, money), which should be stored outside the home, defining a place to go to in case of an emergency (e.g., a shelter), setting up an alarm signal for contact persons (e.g., neighbors) to call emergency services, and advising the patient to avoid areas of increased risk at home in times of escalating violence (e.g., the kitchen, where knives are stored).\n\nScreening for IPV is recommended in all women of reproductive age. If the partner is present during the patient interview, it is important to first separate the patient from the partner before addressing suspected IPV as confrontation in front of the partner can endanger the patient. Requirements for reporting IPV vary by state. Reporting IPV to law enforcement is mandatory in most states if there is evidence of weapon injury or imminent danger. If there is no such evidence, patient consent is necessary before reporting the case to authorities. If children are involved, reporting to child protective services is often mandatory. If the patient is an at-risk adult, reporting to adult protective services may be required.",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with suspected IPV should generally not be encouraged to leave their partners. Many patients are not ready to leave their partners because of financial or family dependencies, feelings of guilt, or fear of retaliation. Pressuring the patient to leave their partner may weaken the patient-physician relationship. If a patient discloses abuse by a partner, a different action is more appropriate.",

In cases of IPV affecting adults who are not considered vulnerable, reporting regulations vary between states. If there is evidence or threat of injury from a weapon, law enforcement must be notified in most states. This patient, however, shows no evidence of injury from a weapon. Furthermore, pregnant women have full decision-making capacity and patient consent is required to report cases like this one if there is no evidence of imminent danger.

    "question_text": "The chief medical officer at an obstetrics and gynecology clinic has noticed an increased refusal rate for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among teenage girls over the past 6 months. The chief medical officer meets with all physicians who provide vaccination counseling and performs mock consultations for training. In response to a simulated patient query about the risk of syncope from the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, an attending physician who has experienced very low rates of vaccination refusal says, “More than 99.99% of patients who received the quadrivalent vaccine did not report any adverse effects and only 0.008% of patients who received the quadrivalent vaccine had significant lightheadedness.” In response to the same query, an intern who has experienced comparatively higher rates of vaccination refusal says, “Approximately 50 in 100,000 patients who receive the quadrivalent vaccine report at least one adverse effect, and approximately 15% of those who reported an adverse effect had significant lightheadedness as one of the adverse effects.” When compared to the attending physician's response, which of the following types of cognitive bias is most likely to affect a patient who hears the intern's response?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Both the attending physician and the intern present the same information. However, the intern's phrasing of the response, which focuses more on the vaccine's negative outcomes, might influence patients' decision-making process and lead to vaccination refusal.",

        "explanation_why": "Framing bias is the tendency for an individual's conclusions to be unduly influenced by the way information is presented (“framed”). The framing bias in this scenario is the result of a heuristic that makes people prefer an option when its positive aspects (positive frame) are highlighted and its negative ones (negative frame) are minimized (e.g., \"glass half full\" vs. “glass half empty”). The consequences of framing biases should be considered during patient counseling and when formulating public health messages. When using a shared decision-making strategy, the effects of framing bias can be minimized by providing both the positive and negative frames, and by using patient decision aids.\n\nCognitive biases can also affect health care providers. For example, the phrasing or order of presentation of information in electronic health records or during patient handovers and patient interviews can emphasize one aspect of the patient's health information over another aspect and lead to diagnostic errors as a result of a framing bias.",

        "explanation_why": "Availability bias is the tendency to consider past events perceived as significant or readily recalled information as more representative of the truth than events perceived as insignificant or information that comes to mind less promptly. An example of availability bias would be a situation in which a patient refuses HPV vaccination after hearing about a friend who experiences syncope following HPV vaccination and fails to consider all the individuals who have not experienced any adverse event after HPV vaccination.",

An example of confirmation bias is a situation in which a patient who already believes that HPV vaccination is harmful selectively reads up on adverse events following HPV vaccination.",

    "question_text": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician as a new patient and requests a whole-body CT scan for cancer screening because she can feel that “there is something in her body.” Her medical history is unremarkable, and she takes no medications. She has had several jobs over the past 10 years but is currently unemployed and has Medicaid insurance. There is no family history of serious illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The patient explains that she has seen several physicians in the past, but all of them refused to order the requested test for her. She says, “You seem wonderful, unlike my previous physicians. They were all incompetent. I even filed a lawsuit against one of them!” On exploring the patient's fear of cancer and the reasons for her inquiry, she reports that she saw an online direct-to-consumer advertisement about whole-body CT scans. The physician explains when whole-body CT scans are performed and why the test is not indicated in her case. The patient becomes agitated and insists that the physician order the test. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the patient's request?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This response firmly yet politely rejects the patient's request. When evaluating a patient's demand for nonindicated care, physicians need to balance the core ethical principles. The ethical principle of patient autonomy, according to which a physician only assists in making decisions corresponding to the patient's personal values, is overruled in favor of beneficence and nonmaleficence in this directive counseling approach. Since there is no evidence that the possible benefits of whole-body CT scanning of asymptomatic individuals (e.g., to relieve the fear of cancer) outweigh the potential harm (e.g., radiation exposure, potential detection of ill-defined abnormalities requiring follow-up testing and interventions), the physician is acting in the patient's best interest (beneficence) and preventing harm (nonmaleficence). Moreover, denying nonindicated investigations and interventions also helps to ensure more equitable care. Finally, it is important for the physician to emphasize that the test is currently not indicated; it might be indicated in the future.\n\nThe patient's behavior in this scenario resembles splitting, a psychological defense mechanism characteristic of borderline personality disorder. Splitting involves separating experiences or people into all-good and all-bad, such as this patient's negative description of her past physicians. To minimize the effects of splitting, health care providers should collaborate toward common management goals, communicate regularly, and clarify their roles in patient care.",

        "explanation_why": "While physicians should always inform patients of their right to seek an additional medical opinion, it is not appropriate to threaten to end the patient-physician relationship because the patient insists on having a nonindicated test. Also, sending the patient to another physician will not solve the problem. Denying the request for a nonindicated screening test is the correct action, which is why the physician should refrain from apologizing. Finally, it is not true that the physician cannot do anything at this point, when the patient could be counseled on other aspects of health maintenance.",

However, x-rays in chronic osteomyelitis show bone destruction, sequestrum formation, and/or periosteal reactions. In osteosarcoma, x-rays show lytic bone lesions adjacent to sclerotic lesions (moth-eaten appearance) and/or Codman triangles. Stress fractures are not typically seen in these diseases.",

Risk factors for stress fractures include female sex, prolonged periods of high-intensity activity (e.g., dancing) without adequate rest, and poor nutrition and/or low calorie intake. Many athletes have borderline low BMI and blood pressure as well as physiological sinus bradycardia.

Additionally, x-rays in MM show lytic lesions, which appear as punched-out holes.",

The appearance is compatible with a stress fracture.The sensitivity of x-ray for the detection of early-stage stress fractures is low, although increases as the fracture heals. Examples of positive findings include a visible fracture line, sclerosis or cortical thickening, and periosteal reaction. MRI is the most sensitive modality for the detection of a stress fracture.",

He has not had problems achieving an erection and cannot recall a triggering event for his concerns. Until now, he has never talked to a physician about his concerns because he feels embarrassed.

He says that he cannot fully enjoy his sexual life and tries to avoid sexual intimacy although he feels attracted to his partner. He is happy with all other aspects of his relationship and personal life. He has hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Medications are chlorthalidone, losartan, and tamsulosin. He does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Genitourinary examination shows no scrotal or penile abnormalities.

        "explanation_why": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine, are used first-line but off-label for the treatment of premature ejaculation in patients without concomitant erectile dysfunction. The indication takes advantage of the side effect profile of SSRIs, which includes ejaculatory delay (up to 9 minutes for paroxetine) and orgasm disturbance. In addition to SSRIs, topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine-prilocaine spray) can be used to reduce the sensitivity of the penis and thereby decrease sexual stimulation. In addition to medical therapy, behavioral therapy can be offered to patients with significant psychological distress (e.g., lack of self-confidence, impaired life quality) and to those in whom psychogenic factors (e.g., anxiety, depression) play a role in the development of premature ejaculation.\n\nIn patients with concomitant erectile dysfunction, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) are used first-line because premature ejaculation is often an outcome of erectile dysfunction. Note that this drug class should be used with caution in patients who are treated with alpha-receptor blockers, such as tamsulosin, because of a risk of orthostatic hypotension.",

        "explanation_why": "To ensure personal safety when dealing with an aggressive patient, the HCP should step two arm lengths away and position themselves closer to the exit (so that there is an escape route) without blocking the patient's view or access to the exit. The HCP should then attempt verbal deescalation. Offering comfort measures (e.g., food, water) is an appropriate initial step. During verbal deescalation, only one HCP should talk to the patient; the HCP should remain calm, maintain a neutral expression, respect the patient's personal space, and avoid gestures that can be perceived as threatening (e.g., sudden movement, staring back at the patient, expressing a condescending or commanding attitude). The HCP should acknowledge the patient's feelings, ask what the patient wants, and allow the patient to choose between different acceptable options (e.g., sitting down or lying down); doing so gives the patient a sense of control while also clarifying rules and limits (e.g., informing the patient that violent or abusive behavior will not be accepted). The HCP should listen actively, use short sentences and simple words, seek out points on which they and the patient can agree, and give the patient time to process information and respond.\n\nIf the patient continues to remain aggressive despite attempts at verbal deescalation, it is appropriate to ask the patient to voluntarily take a calming medication orally before considering use of force. The use of force (e.g., physical restraints, involuntary sedation) should only be considered if all other measures fail or if the patient is actively violent. Physical restraints and/or involuntary sedation should not be used as punishment and should be removed as soon as feasible.",

    "question_text": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination. She reports that for almost a year, he has been episodically “acting out” by stomping his feet and screaming at home. She says that she sometimes scolds him during these episodes in an attempt to correct his behavior, but his tantrums have become worse and more frequent over time. According to his teachers at preschool, he is calm and plays cooperatively. He was born at term and has been healthy since. He can draw a square, hop on one foot, and brush his teeth. He can identify several colors and numbers and occasionally tells stories to his parents. He enjoys being read stories before bedtime, and he sleeps 11 hours every night and 1–2 hours during the day. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40^th percentile for both height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The mother is worried that his behavior will continue when he starts kindergarten next year and asks if it would be appropriate to gently spank her son to discipline him. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for responding to the boy’s behavior?",

Moreover, while punishment may result in a temporary decrease in unwanted behavior, it does not typically lead to behavior extinction.",

        "explanation_why": "Ignoring the child (e.g., by putting them on time-out) is one of the most effective approaches for a preschooler who is having a temper tantrum. Although ignoring the child may initially result in a temporary increase in the behavior, this approach eventually leads to extinction by eliminating any positive reinforcement of the behavior. If using a time-out, the parent should briefly explain to the child that the time-out is related to their temper tantrum. No other communication (e.g., scolding, teaching) should take place during a time-out. Physical punishment is largely ineffective and strongly discouraged because it can cause physical harm. Some forms of physical punishment are considered child abuse under state and federal laws. Physical punishment can also have deleterious effects on the child's psychosocial development, e.g., by teaching them that violence is an appropriate means of conflict resolution.\n\nWhile this is a developmentally normal behavior in preschoolers, health care providers should evaluate children with temper tantrums for conditions that can cause or contribute to tantrums (e.g., hearing and/or visual impairment, learning disabilities).",

In this scenario, the physician immediately made a diagnosis (costochondritis) and failed to consider an alternative cause for the patient’s chest pain (myocardial infarction). The physician should have taken the patient’s risk factors for cardiovascular disease (i.e., older age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension) into account and performed further diagnostic testing. An electrocardiogram is indicated for patients > 35 years of age with suspected costochondritis. If the physician had been aware of his cognitive bias, myocardial infarction could have been diagnosed at the office, which may have improved the patient's outcome. Strategies to avoid cognitive biases include education on cognitive errors, diagnostic time-outs, differential diagnosis generators, and checklists.\n\nIn many situations, several cognitive errors can occur simultaneously. Omission bias, overconfidence, and availability bias may have also occurred in this scenario.",

Misconduct can also occur outside the established physician-patient relationship and does not always constitute malpractice (e.g., research malfeasance, fraudulent advertising). Other examples of misconduct include bullying, making inappropriate comments and/or sexually harassing colleagues or patients, billing fraud, and receiving gifts from patients or pharmaceutical industry representatives. Colleagues who suspect a physician of misconduct should report their concerns to the state medical board, and, if the misconduct implies any legal liability, to the appropriate legal authorities.",

These criteria are based on the patient's medical and psychosocial history and include continued drinking despite knowing that physical or psychological problems are likely to have resulted from alcohol use, continued drinking despite exacerbation of social or interpersonal problems (e.g., divorce), inability to fulfill work obligations, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to reduce drinking, and drinking in physically hazardous situations (e.g., driving). AUD severity is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of criteria met. This patient meets several diagnostic criteria for AUD. Assessing the severity of AUD is important for the choice of treatment. Psychosocial intervention alone is the preferred treatment for mild AUD, while a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial intervention is recommended for patients with moderate or severe AUD.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Most cases of RLS are idiopathic or familial, but RLS can also occur as a result of iron deficiency, azotemia (e.g., due to diabetic nephropathy), or the use of certain medications (e.g., beta blockers, dopamine antagonists). The initial treatment of RLS consists of supportive care (e.g., sleep hygiene, exercise, avoiding coffee and alcohol) and iron supplementation. Pharmacotherapy is considered if these measures are unsuccessful. Intermittent RLS (i.e., mild symptoms < 2 ×/week) is treated with intermittent carbidopa-levodopa, benzodiazepine (e.g., clonazepam), benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (e.g., temazepam), or low-potency opioid (e.g., codeine, tramadol) therapy. For patients with chronic persistent RLS, the first-line medication is an alpha-2-delta ligand (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin). Dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole) were previously the first-line medication for chronic persistent RLS. They are now considered second-line treatment because of their associated risks, such as developing impulse control disorders and long-term augmentation, which is a paradoxical worsening of symptoms with increasing doses.",

        "explanation_why": "Combined nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) involves the use of a long-acting nicotine receptor agonist (e.g., patch) along with a short-acting nicotine receptor agonist (e.g., lozenge). This combination treats both withdrawal symptoms and acute cravings and is therefore more effective for smoking cessation than using only one form of NRT. Patients using NRT should be followed up closely to assess for efficacy and side effects. First-line pharmacological treatment alternatives to combined NRT include varenicline and bupropion, which also reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, behavioral interventions (e.g., counseling) should always be offered as part of first-line therapy to help individuals modify their smoking habits.",

Pregnancy and delivery of her first child 4 years ago were uncomplicated. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 10 years but refrained from smoking during her first pregnancy. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 13.1 g/dL and a serum β-hCG of 2,000 mIU/mL. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a gestational sac consistent with a 5-week pregnancy. When asked about her willingness to quit smoking, the patient replies that she is worried that she won't be able to quit because the frequency of her smoking has increased since the birth of her first child. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial intervention to support smoking cessation in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Behavioral counseling is the first-line intervention for smoking cessation in pregnant individuals and includes frequent (e.g., weekly) office visits and/or telephone counseling for behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and the provision of self-help materials. Although pharmacotherapy (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion) is often used in combination with behavioral interventions in nonpregnant individuals, the safety and efficacy of these medications have not been established in pregnant individuals. Therefore, pharmacotherapy is used on an individual basis in pregnant patients who do not respond to behavioral interventions, when the clinician determines that its benefits outweigh its risks (e.g., in heavy tobacco use).",

She reports that she has been married for 2 years and has argued with her husband a lot during the past 6 months because she suspects that he is cheating on her. She hasn't spoken to her sister in 4 years because her sister “always humiliates me in front of others.” She gets along well with her friends but does not talk to them about her problems because she is afraid that they will gossip about her behind her back. She works as a teacher at an elementary school. She has been monogamous with her husband for the entire marriage except for a sexual relationship with a colleague 13 months ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she has a stable mood and a neutral affect. Her thought process is goal-directed and thought content focuses on possible negative eventualities, but she demonstrates intact reality testing. Her speech is normal.

Individuals with paranoid personality disorder often present with suspicions of infidelity, unjustified fear that others will use information against them, and disproportionate reactions to perceived attacks. Consequently, individuals with paranoid personality disorder tend to be emotionally isolated and unable to form close interpersonal relationships (See “Overview of cluster A personality disorders” table).\n\nMost patients with personality disorders consider their symptoms normal; these egosyntonic behavioral traits lead to significant distress and impaired social functioning. Personality disorders typically begin in early adulthood and remain stable over time. Treatment is challenging and usually includes psychotherapy. Symptomatic treatment may be helpful in patients with comorbid traits (e.g., symptoms of anxiety, psychosis).",

He has been on testosterone therapy for 8 months; at his last visit 2 months ago, he reported mood swings and moderate acne, which have both improved. He states that he is otherwise happy with the physical changes caused by hormone therapy. He has no history of serious illness. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m^2.

    "content_preview": "A 28-year-old transgender man comes to the office for a follow-up visit. He feels well. He has been on testosterone therapy for 8 months; at his last visit 2 months ago, he reported mood swings and moderate acne, which have both improved. He states that he is otherwise happy with the physical changes caused by hormone therapy. He has no history of serious illness. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild facial acne and increased hair growth on the jaw, torso, arms, and legs compared to the last visit. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examination shows no abnormalities.

        "explanation_why": "Erythrocytosis is one of the most common adverse effects of testosterone therapy. Proposed mechanisms through which testosterone leads to erythrocytosis include increased bone marrow stimulation and increased iron turnover. Because erythrocytosis is associated with thrombotic events, hematocrit should be monitored and kept < 50%. Changes in the application method or dose reductions may help avoid adverse effects. For example, transdermal administration (e.g., gel) is less likely to cause erythrocytosis. Other possible adverse effects of testosterone therapy include acne, hair loss, dyslipidemia, exacerbation of migraines, and localized injection site reactions. Most transgender people taking hormone therapy report an improved quality of life.\n\nTestosterone is also used in athletic performance enhancement, for which erythrocytosis is a desired effect.",

    "question_text": "A 66-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 2-day history of vomiting and abdominal pain that radiates to his back. Medical history is remarkable for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. His medication includes enalapril and tamsulosin. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ketorolac is initiated. One day after admission, the patient becomes restless and insists on leaving the hospital to “run some errands” against the advice of his treating physician. When a resident tries to talk to him, the patient suddenly approaches her and screams, “I need to leave now!” A nearby nurse who heard the screaming calls the rapid response team. The arriving psychiatrist slowly approaches the patient without blocking the exit, introduces herself, and calmly asks why he would like to leave the hospital. The patient begins to shout at the psychiatrist and pulls out his intravenous catheter. The psychiatrist asks the patient to sit down and have a glass of water. The patient does not respond and starts mumbling and banging his head against the wall. The psychiatrist says, “I would also like for you to leave this hospital when it is possible.” The patient abruptly turns and throws one of his slippers at the psychiatrist. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The goal of treatment is to relieve the patient's distress while permitting a safe medical and psychiatric evaluation. In uncooperative patients, parenteral administration is required. If necessary, an intramuscular medication can be used initially to calm the patient and facilitate safe intravenous access. Treatment should be based on the suspected cause and severity of symptoms (e.g., an antipsychotic with a short-acting benzodiazepine for severe agitation). If a patient is cooperative, they should be involved in choosing the medication and administration route (oral medication is preferred).\n\nPhysical restraint is sometimes necessary as a subsequent measure if calming medication and deescalation techniques have been unsuccessful and patients continue to be a danger to themselves or health care providers.",

        "explanation_why": "Prolonged seizure duration, closed eyes, unimpaired awareness during the event, lack of postictal phase, and absence of injuries indicate psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) rather than epileptic seizures. PNES resemble epileptic seizures but are psychiatric in origin and do not result in abnormalities on neuroimaging or video EEG. PNES more commonly occur in women than in men. Individuals with PNES often have psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and/or personality disorders.\n\nInitial management involves explaining the diagnosis to the patient in a supportive and nonjudgmental manner to help them gain insight. The patient should then be referred for psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) and/or assessment for a potential underlying predisposing psychiatric comorbidity. Antiepileptic drugs are not used in the treatment of PNES.",

His mother says the patient has had difficulties with speech from an early age. He often refuses to wear shoes, repetitively flaps his hands, and is easily startled by certain sounds. She says his teacher reports that he mostly plays by himself, which consists of lining up toy trucks. Medical history is remarkable for functional constipation. His only medication is polyethylene glycol as needed. He is at the 60^th percentile for height, the 55^th percentile for weight, and the 88^th percentile for head circumference. He does not respond to the physician's questions but occasionally looks at the objects that the physician points to and uses physical gestures to show interest in objects. Hearing and vision tests show no abnormalities. Which of the following factors in this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?",

The action should preferably be framed positively (e.g., \"I will do...\") rather than negatively (e.g., \"I will not...\") and should focus on a process within the patient's control (e.g., \"attending aquatic therapy class once a week\") rather than an outcome that may not be entirely controllable (e.g., \"losing 10 pounds\"). The goal should be challenging yet achievable to avoid diminishing the patient's self-efficacy through repeated failure.\n\nFor patients with chronic pain, SMART goals help connect treatment decisions to specific benefits, set realistic expectations for analgesic therapy, and facilitate discussions on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain management options. An important aspect of setting a SMART goal is following up with the patient within a specified time frame to assess whether they are achieving the goal, to identify potential barriers to achievement, and to reassess the goal.",

His regular medications are continued, including lisinopril. Because of persistent anxiety, he is prescribed hydroxyzine as needed. A nurse retrieves a vial from the unit medication storage area to administer a dose. Thirty minutes later, the patient becomes acutely hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg and reports severe dizziness. A rapid response is called. Review of the medication administration record shows that hydralazine was administered instead of hydroxyzine. A root cause analysis conducted by the hospital's patient safety committee determines that the vials for both medications are identical in size and shape and have similarly colored blue caps and labels in a small font. Which of the following is the most effective measure to prevent this type of error in the future?",

        "explanation_why": "Medication errors are a leading cause of preventable harm in hospitals, and look-alike, sound-alike drugs frequently contribute to these mistakes. Safety standards emphasize the importance of system-level design changes that reduce reliance on individual vigilance. Collaborating with a pharmaceutical supplier that ensures medications have distinct packaging and labeling, such as varying vial sizes, shapes, fonts, and/or cap colors, along with tall man lettering (e.g., hydrALAZINE and hydrOXYzine), creates a strong visual distinction between medications. These design modifications directly address the root causes of confusion and lessen the cognitive burden on clinicians, making errors less likely during retrieval and administration.\n\nAdditional safety measures include using automated dispensing cabinets with barcode technology and software alerts, and organizing medications in a way that minimizes the chance of similar-looking vials being stored near each other.",

This type of intervention is often ineffective due to the high prevalence of alert fatigue, a phenomenon in which clinicians are exposed to a large volume of alerts and begin to dismiss them automatically without careful consideration. Furthermore, an alert that appears during the medication ordering phase does not prevent a selection error when retrieving the medication.",

        "explanation_why": "Placing a warning sticker is a type of administrative control that relies on visual reminders. While seemingly helpful, such warnings are weak interventions because they are prone to inattentional blindness, in which individuals fail to notice stimuli in plain sight. Over time, staff can become desensitized to frequent warnings, causing the sticker to blend into the background. This strategy still depends entirely on the provider noticing and correctly interpreting the warning at the critical moment of medication selection.",

While important for general competency, education and training are considered among the least effective strategies for preventing slips and lapses, according to principles of human factors engineering.
