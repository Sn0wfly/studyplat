Over the past 2 months, he has also had increasing back pain. Physical examination shows an unsteady gait. Muscle strength is decreased in both lower extremities. Sensation to pain, temperature, and position sense is absent in the buttocks, perineum, and lower extremities. Ankle clonus is present. An x-ray of the spine shows multiple sclerotic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",

    "correct_answer": "A",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are typically found in patients with prostate cancer but can also be seen in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. This patient's age, as well as his clinical and radiological findings, which strongly suggest spinal cord compression due to metastatic lesions of the vertebrae, indicate metastatic prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers and also the most common cause of bone metastases in men. It mostly affects older men (average age of onset is 66 years of age).",

        "explanation_why": "An elevated carcinoembryonic antigen can be seen in several different cancers but is especially associated with pancreatic cancer and colon cancer. Although colon cancer can metastasize to the bones and present with osteoblastic metastases, this is not a frequent finding (seen in only 5–10% of cases of advanced colorectal cancer). Instead, the liver and lungs are the most common sites of metastases for both pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma. The absence of typical symptoms associated with colorectal cancer, such as a change in bowel habits, melena or hematochezia, signs of anemia, and/or weight loss, also makes colon cancer less likely.",

In ACS, proprioception and vibration sense are preserved because the posterior spinal arteries provide blood supply to the dorsal columns. The thoracolumbar segment of the spinal cord is a watershed area and is, therefore, the most common site of infarction, as seen here.\n\nACS may occur as a complication of an aortic aneurysm itself or iatrogenically during the repair of the aneurysm (due to damage to the anterior spinal artery and/or artery of Adamkiewicz). Other causes of ACS include trauma (e.g., penetrating injury), hypotension (e.g., from severe hemorrhage), and compression (e.g., tumors, cervical spondylosis).",

    "hint": "Bilateral upper extremity weakness with diminished pain and temperature sensation (particularly in the hands) is characteristic of a central cord syndrome at the level of the cervical spine. Strength and reflexes are intact in the lower extremities because the motor fibers supplying the legs run more laterally in the corticospinal tract than the motor fibers supplying the arms.

MRI of the cervical spine without contrast is the first-line diagnostic test in patients with traumatic cervical myelopathy since it provides the best visualization of the soft tissue structures and can thus accurately delineate the extent of contusion or edema within the spinal cord. Documentation of the severity of spinal cord injury is important for follow-up and prognostication.\n\nIn addition to a non-contrast MRI, a non-contrast CT of the cervical spine may also be performed since a CT, which is more sensitive than MRI for bone pathology, can provide complementary information to the soft tissue findings obtained on MRI.",

Pregnancy is an important risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome because of physiological fluid retention, which leads to edema of soft tissue in and around the carpal tunnel. The sensory disturbances in CTS are classically worse at night and pain on flexion of the wrist (a positive Phalen test) may be present. Occasionally, the pain may radiate to the shoulder, as seen in this patient. Most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome with an onset during pregnancy can be managed by splinting of the wrist.

MS should be suspected if there are recurrent neurologic symptoms in different parts of the body (e.g., wrist paresthesia that resolves, followed by diplopia months later). MS exacerbations tend to cause symptoms that are persistent for days to weeks, until the flare resolves. Finally, MS symptoms tend to improve during pregnancy (possibly due to immunosuppression).",

A pituitary tumor of any kind can cause compressive symptoms (e.g., headache, visual changes), and this patient's amenorrhea and vaginal atrophy do suggest decreased FSH, resulting in low estrogen levels.

Hyperprolactinemia can cause galactorrhea. However, elevated FSH leads to a normal/high estrogen and would not be consistent with vaginal atrophy, which is a sign of decreased estrogen.",

        "explanation_why": "Prolactinomas are the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia has an inhibitory effect on GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), which leads to a decrease in LH and FSH (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) and subsequently a decline in estrogen and testosterone, resulting in amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea, vaginal atrophy, and endometrial atrophy. Hyperprolactinemia has a direct tropic effect on breast tissue and triggers lactation, explaining this patient's galactorrhea — a finding that is seen in 80% of premenopausal women with hyperprolactinemia. A pituitary tumor of any kind can cause compressive symptoms, leading to bitemporal hemianopsia and/or palsy of the adjacent cranial nerves III, IV, or VI. The best next step in the diagnosis of suspected pituitary adenoma is a brain MRI with contrast. First-line treatment for prolactinomas is dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline), which inhibit prolactin secretion and induce shrinkage of the tumor.",

Hyperprolactinemia results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism because prolactin inhibits the synthesis and release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which results in decreased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In men, decreased concentrations of LH result in decreased production of testosterone in testicular Leydig cells. The resulting manifestations include erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, reduced testicular volume, infertility, gynecomastia, and loss of axillary hair. The visual deficits caused by a growing pituitary adenoma develop very gradually as the mass grows and compresses the optic chiasm (causing bitemporal hemianopia) and the oculomotor nerve (causing diplopia).\n\nSee “Clinical features of hyperprolactinemia” table.",

    "question_text": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a fall that occurred while he was taking a shower earlier that morning. His wife heard him fall and entered the bathroom to find his arms and legs twitching. The episode lasted approximately 30 seconds.

On CT scan, however, glioblastoma multiforme appears as a poorly demarcated, hypodense, intraaxial lesion that tends to infiltrate along condensed white matter tracts such as the corticospinal tract and the corpus callosum. On T2-weighted MRI, glioblastoma multiforme typically appears as an expansive hyperintense signal, which represents vasogenic edema involving both the cortex and underlying white matter.

The pain occurs over her left cheek, is 9 out of 10 in intensity, radiates towards her mouth, and lasts around half a minute before subsiding. These episodes commonly occur when she washes her face, brushes her teeth, or eats a meal. She does not have visual disturbances, weakness of her facial muscles, or hearing loss. She had a tooth extracted about 2 months ago, but the facial pain has persisted. She has hypothyroidism and vitiligo. Her mother has major depressive disorder. Current medications include levothyroxine and herbal cream. She appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurological examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The efficacy of carbamazepine has been proven in several randomized controlled trials. However, it is not well tolerated by all patients because of its common side effects (e.g., hepatotoxicity, hematologic abnormalities, sedation, diplopia) and potential for drug interactions. Oxcarbazepine, which has similar efficacy and overall better tolerability, is another first-line agent for patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Surgical management (e.g., microvascular decompression) is usually reserved for patients who show no symptomatic improvement with medication therapy or who develop significant side effects.",

            "description": "Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by attacks of facial pain in the area of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. Classical trigeminal neuralgia is caused by neurovascular compression, most often by an aberrant loop of a neighboring artery (usually the superior cerebellar artery). The pain is typically very severe in intensity, has a sharp, stabbing quality, and lasts several seconds. Attacks can occur without provocation but are sometimes triggered by stimuli such as brushing teeth.",

Rhonchi are heard at the right lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. There is a small ulceration on the left foot. An x-ray of the chest shows a right lung mass with lobar consolidation. Antibiotic therapy with levofloxacin is started. Three days later, the patient has a seizure and difficulty coordinating movements with his left hand. An MRI of the brain shows an intraparenchymal lesion with peripheral ring enhancement. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage yields weakly acid-fast, gram-positive bacteria with branching, filamentous shapes. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?",

    "question_text": "A 70-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe lower back pain for the past 3 weeks. The pain was initially exacerbated by activity but now presents also at rest. The patient has not had a headache or a cough. He reports no changes in bowel movements or urination. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His current medications include metformin and lisinopril.

However, CMV encephalitis is usually seen in patients with a CD4^+  cell count < 50/mm^3, and causes periventricular white matter lesions that are diffusely contrast-enhancing rather than a solitary ring-enhancing lesion. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) rather than CMV is implicated in the pathogenesis of PCNSL and there are no approved antivirals that specifically target EBV.",

Systemic glucocorticoids rapidly decrease the size of a PCNSL and can alleviate tumor-related symptoms but should only be started after a brain biopsy has been obtained. Radiotherapy is indicated if the patient has a poor functional status (i.e., not a candidate for chemotherapy) and for patients with intraorbital or spinal cord lesions. Surgical resection is not typically a part of the management of the PCNSL. In patients with HIV-related PCNSL, administering antiretroviral therapy concurrently with definitive cancer treatment is essential for facilitating immune reconstitution.",

If ICP is normal, blood pressure should be decreased to < 160 mm Hg through labetalol or nicardipine administration. If intracranial hypertension is suspected (as is likely in this patient, given his altered mental status and sluggishly reactive pupils), blood pressure should be lowered more cautiously, as cerebral perfusion must be maintained.

He feels well but reports occasional episodes of slurred speech and weakness during the past 6 months. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 142/96 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. ECG shows a regular sinus rhythm, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and no acute abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 142/96 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. ECG shows a regular sinus rhythm, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and no acute abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "correct_answer": "A",

    "hint": "This patient's occasional episodes of weakness and slurred speech are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). This history, in combination with his peripheral vascular disease, multiple risk factors (smoking, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia), and carotid bruit indicate symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) due to atherosclerosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Duplex ultrasonography of the neck is typically the first-line imaging modality for patients with symptomatic CAS (e.g., TIA, amaurosis fugax, ischemic stroke). Some guidelines also recommend ultrasonography of the neck to screen for CAS in asymptomatic patients with a carotid bruit and multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In patients with CAS, ultrasonography shows a focally-increased velocity of blood flow. Duplex ultrasonography is an inexpensive, noninvasive test with high specificity and sensitivity for the detection of CAS. It can also quantify the degree of stenosis.\n\nAntiplatelet therapy, statin therapy, blood pressure control, and lifestyle changes (e.g., smoking cessation, weight control, regular exercise) are the mainstays of treatment in CAS. Carotid revascularization (typically with carotid endarterectomy) is indicated for patients with symptomatic disease and severe stenosis (≥ 70%).",

In this patient, a right-sided hemisection of the spinal cord has resulted in right-sided flaccid paralysis (damaged right lateral corticospinal tract), as well as a right-sided loss of proprioception, tactile discrimination, and vibratory sense (damaged right dorsal column). Additionally, damage to the right spinothalamic tract has resulted in a left-sided loss of pain and temperature sensation. These symptoms are consistent with acute manifestations of Brown-Séquard syndrome. Within 1–2 weeks after the initial injury, patients typically develop an ipsilateral Babinski reflex and ipsilateral spastic paralysis. Bladder symptoms (e.g., incontinence) are generally not present, as there is only unilateral involvement of the descending autonomic fibers.",

However, pulse pressure is an indicator of stroke volume and not a direct indicator of end-organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation aims to achieve adequate end-organ perfusion, so a change in pulse pressure is not the best indicator to evaluate fluid resuscitation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion and to restore intravascular volume. Since renal blood flow (and therefore GFR) is highly sensitive to changes in blood pressure and intravascular volume, urine output can serve as a surrogate measure to determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate. Ideally, urine output in adults should be greater than 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Therefore, a 70-kg man should have a urine output of 35–70 mL/hr. A urine output of 25mL in 3 hours suggests that his kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow and therefore that he has not received adequate fluid resuscitation.\n\nWith adequate fluid resuscitation, an increase in some of the other indices, such as pulse pressure and Glasgow coma scale, might occur before a change in urine output is apparent. However, these parameters are not specific indicators of end-organ perfusion. Other parameters, such as lactate and a base deficit, are more useful for determining the prognosis than for guiding fluid therapy.",

However, serum lactate levels are not used to determine whether fluid resuscitation is inadequate because, even after adequate fluid resuscitation and correction of tissue hypoperfusion, lactate levels may not reach normal levels (< 2 mEq/L) for a few hours. Lactate clearance may take even longer in critically ill patients as a result of a prolonged lactate half-life (due to hepatic and/or renal dysfunction) and/or increased glycolysis. In trauma patients, elevated lactate levels are associated with increased mortality and are used to evaluate the prognosis.",

He has acute myeloid leukemia and is currently receiving chemotherapy. On arrival, his temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 63/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He appears lethargic but opens his eyes to loud verbal commands. He is oriented to person and place. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and blood pressure is 148/87 mm Hg. Examination shows an area of soft-tissue swelling over the left temporal region. A CT scan of the head shows a biconvex lens-shaped hyperdensity in the left frontotemporal region. After returning from the CT scan, the patient only opens his eyes to painful stimuli and responds to questions with incomprehensible sounds. He withdraws from painful stimuli. On repeat examination, the left pupil is 6 mm in diameter and reacts minimally to light. The right pupil is 3 mm in diameter and reacts normally to light. His respiratory rate is 10/min and he is intubated in the emergency department. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

It establishes an osmolarity gradient, which draws water from the interstitium across the blood-brain barrier into the vessels and thereby decreases the intracranial pressure. Hypotonic saline would do just the opposite, further increasing intracranial pressure by drawing water into the brain, and is, therefore, contraindicated in this patient.",

However, glucocorticoids (including dexamethasone) should not be used in patients with severe traumatic head injuries because they are associated with a significant increase in acute mortality.

However, it is only the second-line treatment because it does not always allow complete evacuation of the hematoma and/or ligation of the bleeding meningeal vessel. In centers with limited neurosurgical expertise, burr hole evacuation is an acceptable alternative, because it can be performed by general surgeons, but generally it is not the preferred surgical approach.",

This procedure also helps identify and ligate the injured vessel. A delay in surgical treatment is associated with a worsening prognosis. This patient's rapid decline in consciousness (GCS is 8 following the CT scan), decrease in respiratory rate, and anisocoria suggest ongoing compression of the brain that should prompt immediate decompressive craniotomy. Further management includes countering the elevated ICP using head elevation, hyperventilation, and/or osmotic diuresis with mannitol or hyperosmotic saline solution.",

It takes much longer than a CT scan, making it unsuitable for unstable patients, such as this one. This patient's CT confirms acute epidural hematoma, and further diagnostics would unnecessarily delay treatment. Urgent treatment is indicated to prevent further neurological deterioration, permanent brain damage, and death.",

The patient was on her way to work as she lost her balance, hitting her head on the sidewalk. She had an initial loss of consciousness for a couple of minutes following the accident. She currently has nausea and a headache. She has vomited twice during the last 30 minutes. She has no history of a serious illness. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. She has never used illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 50/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. She is oriented to person, place, and time. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows bradycardia but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a bruise on the right temporal side of the head. While the remainder of the physical examination is being performed, the patient starts having a seizure. Intravenous lorazepam is administered and she is admitted to the intensive care unit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "An epidural hematoma should be suspected in any patient with severe head trauma and initial loss of consciousness that is followed by a lucid interval and then soon after by a new decline in mental status with signs of elevated ICP. The lucid interval represents the time it takes for blood to accumulate in the epidural space before compressing the brain and resulting in clinical deterioration. The length of the lucid interval depends on the severity of the trauma and the intensity of the bleeding and is typically shorter in patients with bleeding from the meningeal arteries compared to patients who bleed from a torn bridging vein (as seen with subdural hematomas).",

            "description": "Most epidural hematomas (EDH) are caused by a rupture/tear of the middle meningeal artery secondary to a traumatic head injury, typically associated with a skull fracture. The resulting hemorrhage separates the dura mater from the inner aspect of the calvarium and accumulates within the epidural space. As the dura mater is tightly adherent at the skull suture lines, an EDH does not extend beyond the sutures. An EDH would be seen on neuroimaging as a biconvex hyperdense lesion that does not cross the suture lines.",

The episode occurred 6 hours ago and lasted approximately 5 minutes. The patient has no pain. He has a 3-month history of intermittent blurriness out of his right eye and reports a 10-minute episode of slurred speech and left-sided facial droop that occurred 2 months ago. He has hypercholesterolemia, stable angina pectoris, hypertension, and a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include glyburide, atorvastatin, labetalol, isosorbide, lisinopril, and aspirin. He feels well. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 154/78 mm Hg. The extremities are well perfused with strong peripheral pulses. Ophthalmologic examination shows visual acuity of 20/30 in the left eye and 20/40 in the right eye. Visual fields are normal. Fundoscopic examination shows two grayish-white spots along the supratemporal and inferotemporal arcade. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Cardiopulmonary examination shows systolic rumbling at the right carotid artery. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia. In addition to obtaining a CT scan of the head, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "Sudden, painless, transient monocular loss of vision with cloudy discoloration along the retinal arterial supply on fundoscopy is highly suggestive of retinal artery occlusion. The most common cause in older adults is atherosclerotic emboli, which is consistent with this patient's age, extensive atherosclerotic risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, stable angina pectoris, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus), history of possible transient ischemic attack, and finding of an ipsilateral carotid bruit on examination.",

Cardiogenic emboli are the most common cause of retinal artery occlusion in younger patients (< 40 years of age) and should be suspected based on a patient history that includes, e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF), endocarditis, or valvular disease. However, while this patient does have a history and exam findings that both suggest retinal vessel occlusion and a TIA, he has no AF and there are signs of carotid artery stenosis. Echocardiography would be an appropriate step in management only after atherosclerotic causes of this patient's symptoms have been ruled out.",

While fluorescein angiography might show slow or absent filling of retinal arteries in retinal artery occlusion, it is usually indicated when the diagnosis is not otherwise clear, e.g., when ischemic retinal whitening is not clearly present on fundoscopy. In this case, such findings are apparent, as is the diagnosis of retinal artery occlusion. Fluorescein angiography would not contribute significantly to this patient's care.",

For example, migraine is the most common cause of transient binocular vision loss in young adults. This patient's vision loss was transient and he has a history of intermittent blurriness that could be consistent with migrainous aura, but the lack of other migraine symptoms, along with the monocular presentation, make the diagnosis of migrainous aura unlikely.",

Suspicion of GCA should be especially high in patients above the age of 50 with fundoscopy findings of pallid optic disc swelling without apparent emboli. While our patient's monocular vision loss and history of intermittent monocular blurriness could be consistent with GCA, he lacks additional symptoms such as temporal headache or jaw claudication, and his fundus examination reveals clearly demarcated areas of vascular involvement, which is not consistent with GCA. A temporal artery biopsy is therefore not indicated.",

She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased sensation to temperature and pinprick below her waist. She feels the vibrations of a tuning fork placed on both of her great toes.

The anterior spinal cord is at increased risk for infarction because it is supplied by the single anterior spinal artery, which has few collaterals. Therefore, significant blood loss, as seen in this patient, can lead to ischemic infarction of the anterior spinal cord.\n\nIn patients with ASA syndrome vibration and proprioception are typically preserved because the dorsal column, which is supplied by posterior spinal arteries, remains intact.",

His mother says that he did not lose consciousness but has been agitated and complaining about a headache since the event. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg. There is a large bruise on the anterior scalp and several superficial abrasions on both hands and knees. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. A noncontrast CT scan of the head shows a nondepressed linear skull fracture with a 2-mm separation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

CT angiography is used to identify the location of the aneurysm before either clipping or coiling is performed. Other measures that should be undertaken immediately include blood pressure control (e.g., with labetalol or calcium channel blockers), vasospasm prevention (e.g., with nimodipine), and control of elevated intracranial pressure (e.g., head-of-bed elevation, administration of mannitol, intubation, and controlled hyperventilation).",

Acute onset of symptoms following facial trauma is usually caused by nerve injury (e.g., transection); therefore, surgery (e.g., nerve repair) may be indicated. A delayed presentation (e.g., one day after trauma) is most likely secondary to edema within the facial nerve canal. In this patient, corticosteroid therapy is indicated to control swelling within the facial nerve canal. If this patient's facial nerve palsy does not improve or worsens, surgical decompression of the facial nerve canal is indicated.\n\nProper eye care with artificial tears and moisturizing ointments is an important part of managing lagophthalmos.",

Surgical decompression of the facial nerve puts the patient at risk for further injury to an already injured nerve, may prolong or prevent nerve recovery, and carries the risk of additional complications such as hearing loss, vestibular function loss, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and meningitis.",

Although the patient presents with clinical features associated with Bell palsy (e.g. lagophthalmos, flattened nasolabial fold, drooping of a corner of the mouth), his facial palsy is likely the result of his recent trauma. In addition, the patient does not report dermatomal pain or vesicles near the external meatus, which would be expected in herpes zoster.",

However, the patient presented with delayed facial nerve palsy (one day after the traumatic event), which indicates that nerve transection is not the underlying pathology in this patient. Moreover, the CT scan does not show evidence of a transverse fracture of the temporal bone nor is there a penetrating injury near the cheek to suggest facial nerve transection.",

Dopamine agonists inhibit the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland, leading to decreased symptoms of hyperprolactinemia and a reduction in tumor size. Treatment for prolactinoma is indicated in all symptomatic patients (e.g., those with galactorrhea, hypogonadism) or in patients with existing or impending signs of mass effect (e.g., visual impairments, headaches).\n\nBecause bromocriptine is more likely to cause side effects (e.g., nausea) and is less effective than cabergoline, it is the second-line treatment for prolactinoma. Surgery may only be considered in patients for whom pharmacological treatment has been unsuccessful or cannot be tolerated.",

CT scan of the head has a high sensitivity for SAH (> 90%) especially if performed within 6 hours of symptom onset, but small bleeds may not be detected. Even though this patient has negative head imaging, his sudden-onset headache with nausea and vomiting is highly concerning for SAH and warrants further diagnostic work-up. Expected LP findings in SAH include elevated RBCs, high protein, xanthochromia (after 6–12 hours), and possibly elevated opening pressure. CT angiography is an alternative second-line test to diagnose SAH.\n\nIt is important to distinguish SAH from a traumatic spinal tap. In SAH, the amount of RBCs remains the same in a series of collection tubes, whereas in a traumatic LP the RBC count decreases (until reaching zero) over successive collection tubes.",

This patient's tumor is in the fourth ventricle, which is the most common location for ependymoma in children and the last ventricle along the CSF pathway; as such, all ventricles become dilated with trapped CSF. Ependymomas typically appear as homogeneous enhancing masses on CT neuroimaging, often with cysts and calcifications. Ependymomas have a poor prognosis, especially when located in the posterior fossa. The next step in management for this patient would be a brain MRI to provide better images of the tumor. Treatment would likely involve surgical resection and possibly radiation therapy.",

After quickly getting off the bike and lying down, she lost consciousness. She was unconscious for a period of one minute. When she regained consciousness, she had neck stiffness, nausea, and two episodes of vomiting. She has hypertension. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her current medications include chlorthalidone and a multivitamin. She is in severe distress. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 169/102 mm Hg. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows hyperdense material between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The patient is taken to the operating room for surgical clipping and transferred to the intensive care unit. Five days later, she has new-onset focal weakness of her left lower extremity. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 148/90 mm Hg. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left lower extremity and 5/5 in the right lower extremity. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient’s current condition?",

This patient's sudden-onset neurologic deficit five days after SAH is a common manifestation of vasospasm, which occurs as a complication of ∼ 30% of SAH cases and is more common with aneurysms. This patient should be evaluated with CT scan and angiography to distinguish potential vasospasm from rebleeding and receive prompt treatment to prevent ischemic stroke.\n\nDespite its vasodilatatory effects, nimodipine does not significantly reverse angiographic vasospasm. The mechanism of ischemic risk reduction for patients with SAH is not fully understood, but it may include neuroprotection via blockade of calcium influx to the damaged neurons, impairment of platelet aggregation, and/or vasodilation of arteries too small to be appreciated on angiography.",

On arrival, he is alert and oriented. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There is a 3-cm laceration over the forehead and multiple bruises over the trunk. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The right knee is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun and intravenous acetaminophen is administered. Two hours later, blood-tinged fluid spontaneously drains from both nostrils and is made worse by leaning forward. On a piece of gauze, it shows up as a rapidly expanding clear ring of fluid surrounding blood. Further evaluation of this patient over the next 24 hours is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

        "explanation_why": "Basilar skull fracture can be associated with cranial nerve palsies. Anterior basilar skull fracture can cause cranial nerve (CN) I palsies, as well as palsies in CN V, VI, VII, or VIII. However, CN XII exits the skull at the hypoglossal canal of the occipital bone (in the posterior fossa) and thus is associated with posterior basilar skull fractures, not anterior basilar skull fractures. Additionally, most cranial nerve palsies associated with basilar skull fracture are not present until 1–3 days after injury, because the palsy is the result of compression or contusion of the nerve, which does not occur acutely. If a nerve is transected by trauma (which is uncommon), then the palsy would be present immediately.",

    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "Focal weakness and paresthesia of the left lower extremity with hyperreflexia on the same side are consistent with an upper motor neuron lesion. The MRI confirms the location of the tumor and shows a round, well-demarcated, extraaxial tumor with a dural tail in the parasagittal cortical region, which is highly suggestive of a meningioma.",

This patient's large meningioma is located on the convex surface of the cerebrum and is easily accessible via parietal craniotomy. Complete surgical resection of the meningioma ensures the lowest chance of recurrence. Focused radiotherapy (stereotactic radiotherapy) is indicated in inoperable tumors (e.g., meningiomas near the optic sheath or critical structures at the base of the skull) or if the tumor is incompletely resected.\n\nSymptoms are determined by the location of the tumor. However, most meningiomas are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally.",

This patient also does not have risk factors for a primary CNS lymphoma (e.g., immunosuppression). Moreover, both of these tumors are usually intra-axial lesions.

The condition is commonly seen in individuals who wear narrow or high-heeled footwear and is characterized by the presence of Mulder sign and Tinel sign.\n\nMorton neuroma is a clinical diagnosis based on history and provocation testing. If there is clinical uncertainty, imaging is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis or exclude alternative causes of chronic foot pain. Initial treatment includes reducing pressure on the metatarsal heads through wide footwear and orthotics. Other treatment options include ultrasound-guided corticosteroid and local anesthetic injections. Surgical resection of the neuroma may be necessary for symptomatic individuals who do not respond to other therapy modalities.",

However, initial manifestations are highly variable and individuals may have atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as subtle vocal changes. As the disease progresses, most individuals eventually develop one or both of the life-threatening symptoms: respiratory impairment and dysphagia.",

Patients experience a symmetric cape-like distribution of pain and temperature sensory loss around the upper trunk, shoulders, and upper limbs. Vibration and position sense are selectively spared because fibers of the posterior columns decussate higher up in the medulla. As syringomyelia progresses, lower motor neuron weakness develops symmetrically in the upper limbs (evident by hand weakness, areflexia, and fasciculations in this patient) because the fluid-filled cavity begins to compress the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord at the level of the lesion. As the lesion expands, patients develop an upper motor neuron palsy of the lower extremities and lower half of the trunk (due to involvement of the corticospinal tracts), as well as complete sensory loss below the level of the lesion (including loss of vibration and position sense). However, sensations around the sacral region are usually spared.",

He describes the pain as 10 out of 10 in intensity. The pain radiates to the neck and is aggravated by lying down. The patient has vomited once on his way to the hospital. He had a similar headache 1 week ago that resolved after a few hours without treatment. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 165/89 mm Hg. Pupils are equal and reactive to light and extraocular eye movements are normal. There is no weakness or sensory loss. Reflexes are 2+ throughout. Neck flexion causes worsening of the pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

Any patient who presents with a sudden, severe headache must have SAH ruled out with a head CT scan.\n\nIf the head CT scan is negative for SAH, but clinical suspicion remains high, a lumbar puncture is indicated. A negative head CT scan and negative lumbar puncture rule out acute SAH. Analgesia, IV fluids, and seizure prophylaxis are initiated if SAH is diagnosed. Further treatment depends on the suspected cause of the hemorrhage. In this patient's case (suspected ruptured aneurysm), surgical clipping would likely be attempted.",

She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome. Her current medications include metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the tuning fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the right side and shows a similar pattern. The vibration tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The most common brain tumors in this location are acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas), which usually arise from Schwann cells in the internal auditory meatus and may expand into the cerebellopontine angle. Later symptoms include unilateral facial weakness (due to pressure on CN VII) and unilateral facial pain and/or paresthesia (due to pressure on CN V) as well as gait instability due to vestibular deficits. Further management includes audiometry and cranial MRI with contrast to confirm the tumor. For patients with large tumors or significant hearing loss, the treatment of choice is surgical removal or radiation therapy. For patients with smaller tumors and minimal hearing loss, observation with follow-up may be appropriate.\n\nThe presence of bilateral acoustic neuromas should raise suspicion for neurofibromatosis type II.",

            "description": "Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells and primarily originate within the vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII. The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

Cerumen impaction typically manifests as sudden (e.g., triggered by showering or bathing) rather than progressive hearing loss. Unlike in this woman, the Rinne test would be abnormal (negative) in the affected ear and the Weber test would show a lateralization to the same ear, suggesting conductive rather than sensorineural hearing loss.",

Her daughter was with her at the time and recalls that her mother was complaining of a diffuse headache and nausea about 2 hours before the incident. The daughter says that her mother has not had any recent falls and was sitting in a chair when she lost consciousness. She has hypertension. Current medications include amlodipine, a daily multivitamin, and acetaminophen. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 158/100 mm Hg. She is disoriented and unable to follow commands. Examination shows nuchal rigidity. She has flexor posturing to painful stimuli. Fundoscopic examination is notable for bilateral vitreous hemorrhages. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. An emergency noncontrast CT scan of the head is obtained and shows a diffuse hemorrhage at the base of the brain that is largest over the left hemisphere.

    "question_text": "A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was the unrestrained passenger. His wife confirms that he has hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic lower back pain. Current medications include metoprolol, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and oxycodone. On arrival, he is lethargic and confused. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 172/78 mm Hg. The eyes open spontaneously. The pupils are equal and sluggish. He moves his extremities in response to commands. There is a 3-cm scalp laceration. There are multiple bruises over the right upper extremity. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters are inserted. A 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography in trauma is negative. Plain CT of the brain shows a 5-mm right subdural hematoma with no mass effect. Fresh frozen plasma is administered. Which of the following is most likely to reduce this patient's cerebral blood flow?",

His wife confirms that he has hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic lower back pain. Current medications include metoprolol, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and oxycodone. On arrival, he is lethargic and confused. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 172/78 mm Hg. The eyes open spontaneously. The pupils are equal and sluggish. He moves his extremities in response to commands. There is a 3-cm scalp laceration. There are multiple bruises over the right upper extremity. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters are inserted. A 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography in trauma is negative. Plain CT of the brain shows a 5-mm right subdural hematoma with no mass effect. Fresh frozen plasma is administered. Which of the following is most likely to reduce this patient's cerebral blood flow?",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Reducing this patient's cerebral blood flow can lower intracranial pressure (ICP) but also lead to ischemia. Cerebral autoregulation is controlled by the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO_2).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Hyperventilation blows off CO_2, which lowers PaCO_2 levels and results in arterial smooth muscle constriction. Based on Poiseuille's law, small decreases in the arterial radius from vasoconstriction can profoundly decrease cerebral blood flow. Since the cranial vault has a finite amount of space, decreasing cerebral blood flow allows more room for brain tissue and reductions in ICP.\n\nAlthough hyperventilation was commonly used to reduce ICP, studies have failed to show long-term outcome advantages. Prophylactic hyperventilation is no longer recommended and should only be used as a temporary measure for elevated ICP refractory to medical therapy.",

This reduction in intracranial pressure can improve cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow. However, this technique is controversial, as the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy in traumatic brain injury is unclear and would not be the most appropriate first step in management for this patient.",

This technique is most commonly used to lower ICP in patients with hydrocephalus (e.g., normal pressure hydrocephalus). However, lumbar puncture is contraindicated in any patient with increased intracranial pressure due to brain swelling, as CSF removal can release pressure in the lower spinal cord causing downward brain herniation and death.",

Decreases in ICP can increase cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow by creating more space for vessels. Unless there is evidence of brain herniation, hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with confirmed increases in ICP.",

        "explanation_why": "Mannitol acts by rapidly expanding circulating blood volume and decreasing blood viscosity. This causes an increase in cerebral blood flow and the subsequent compensatory cerebral vasoconstriction results in an initial fall in ICP. After about 15–30 minutes, it further increases cerebral blood flow by increasing cerebral perfusion pressure. Because prolonged mannitol therapy can increase ICP, it should only be used in the acute phase in patients with signs of significant increases in ICP (e.g., mass effect, impending brain herniation).",

She was riding a bike when she lost control and hit a car on the opposite side of the road. On arrival, she is unconscious. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. Her pulse is 56/min, respirations are 8/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 196/85 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm laceration over the left cheek and a 3-cm laceration over the left chest. There are multiple abrasions over her face and chest. She opens her eyes and flexes her extremities to painful stimuli. The pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light. There are decreased breath sounds over the left lung. The trachea is central. There is no jugular venous distention. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The left knee and right ankle are swollen; range of motion is limited. Two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters are inserted. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is initiated. A focused assessment with sonography in trauma is negative. An occlusive dressing is applied over the left chest wound. She is scheduled for a noncontrast CT scan of the brain. Which of the following is the underlying cause of this patient's hypertension?",

        "explanation_why": "Elevated ICP in this patient has led to a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The sympathetic nervous system is activated in order to maintain CPP by increasing systolic blood pressure, which explains this patient's hypertension and widening pulse pressure. The increased arterial pressure stimulates aortic arch baroreceptors that activate the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in bradycardia. A further increase in ICP leads to brain stem compression, which further promotes bradycardia and causes dysfunction of the respiratory center (bradypnea and irregular breathing).\n\nClinical features of elevated ICP warrant urgent neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to evaluate for intracerebral pathologies and guide further treatment, and potentially invasive ICP monitoring to confirm the diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Right eye medial deviation and elevation would be caused by unopposed CN III activity due to concomitant CN IV and VI palsies. When CN III is unopposed, the associated extraocular muscles (medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles) together produce adduction and elevation or depression of the eye. Instead, uncal herniation causes CN III palsy, resulting in pupillary dilation and absent light reflex (as seen in this patient), abduction, and slight depression of the eye (“down and out” gaze). Although severe advanced uncal herniation can eventually cause CN IV and VI palsies due to brainstem displacement and secondary hemorrhagic brainstem infarctions, CN III would also likely be impaired. In concomitant CN III, CN IV, and CN VI palsies, the eye position would be closer to a neutral gaze.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This patient has a large right-sided subdural hematoma which results in elevated ICP and cerebral edema, presenting as midline shift and herniation of the medial temporal lobe (the uncus). Initially, uncal herniation manifests with ipsilateral compression of CN III and the corticospinal tract (resulting in contralateral hemiparesis). As herniation of the ipsilateral (right) uncus progresses, displacing the midbrain and compressing the contralateral (left) cerebral peduncle (which contains the left corticospinal tract) across the tentorium, it causes ipsilateral (right-sided) hemiparesis and upper motor neuron (UMN) signs (e.g., Babinski sign) as most corticospinal fibers cross over, a process called Kernohan phenomenon. This can be confusing in a clinical setting because the patient's lesion is on the right side, but right-sided hemiplegia typically localizes a left-sided lesion (this is why Kernohan syndrome is also called false localizing syndrome). This patient's extensor posturing is a sign that midbrain compression has already begun.\n\nAfter emergency resuscitative measures (e.g., intubation, mannitol, oxygen supplementation, and head of bed elevation), emergency surgical decompression is required. As the herniation progresses, the brainstem can become compressed and displaced caudally, shearing the vessels, leading to midbrain and pontine hemorrhages, and subsequently resulting in coma, apnea, impaired circulation, and death.",

During this period, she has also had numbness on the left side of her face. She has never had such an episode before. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her father died of lung cancer 1 week ago. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She drinks one glass of wine daily. Her current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. She is oriented to person, place, and time but speaks slowly with slurred speech. Her temperature is 37°C (98.7°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows drooping of the left side of the face. Examination shows full muscle strength. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. A finger-nose test and her gait are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a right-sided carotid bruit. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within the reference ranges. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. A noncontrast CT scan of the brain shows no abnormalities. On the way back from the CT scan, her presenting symptoms resolve. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Because this patient's focal symptoms resolve spontaneously without intervention and there is no evidence of ischemia on neuroimaging, it is by definition a transient ischemic attack (TIA) rather than a stroke.\n\nIn patients with ongoing symptoms of stroke, an emergency noncontrast CT scan of the head is used to exclude intracranial hemorrhage. If there is no evidence of stroke on the emergency CT scan or in patients with resolving symptoms, a diffusion-weighted MRI can be used to detect signs of reversible ischemia and diagnose TIA. Besides neuroimaging, antiplatelet therapy should be initiated urgently because TIA is associated with a high risk of subsequent stroke.",

This diagnosis requires clinical symptoms and CNS lesions to be distributed over space and time, meaning there is a history of otherwise unexplained neurologic symptoms in the past and CNS lesions are seen on MRI in different locations and at differing stages (new and old). A suspected first episode of neurologic deficits in the context of MS (e.g., opticus neuritis) is called a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which may partially or fully resolve (like relapsing-remitting MS). However, a sudden onset of symptoms within minutes and resolution of symptoms within one hour are neither consistent with an episode of CIS nor MS.",

However, rather than causing symptoms to one specific nerve root, TOS usually compresses the lower trunk (C8–T1 nerve roots) of the brachial plexus. In a patient with TOS, Spurling's test would not recreate the patient's symptoms because the test is relatively specific for damage/irritation of the cervical nerve roots rather than the brachial plexus. Furthermore, TOS often affects vascular structures as well; patients present with arm pallor, coldness, decreased pulses, and/or cyanosis of the affected extremity, none of which is present in this patient.",

However, initial manifestations are highly variable and individuals may have atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as subtle vocal changes.

Her radiating pain and paresthesias are caused by damage and/or irritation of the C6 nerve root, which innervates the radial aspect of the forearm and the thumb. These symptoms are reproduced with Spurling's maneuver, which has a high specificity for cervical radiculopathy. This patient's weakness results from damage to the same nerve root, as C6 provides motor function to the wrist extensors. C6 nerve root damage is also causing the decreased brachioradialis reflex in this patient, as C6 supplies motor function to that muscle.\n\nOther possible causes of the patient's radiculopathy include cervical spondylosis or a tumor causing nerve root compression. Her neurologic symptoms may also be caused by infections that affect the peripheral nervous system such as herpes zoster and Lyme disease. The diagnostic workup includes MRI, which would show a laterally prolapsed disk with surrounding edema in the case of disk herniation.",

He was cycling downhill at approximately 30 miles per hour when he lost control at a curve in the road. He was wearing a helmet and did not lose consciousness. There is no personal history of serious illness and he takes no medications. On arrival, the patient is alert and oriented. He is placed on a backboard with a cervical collar around his neck. Pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple bruises over the forehead and right cheek. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There is a 2-cm laceration below the right ear. Both ear canals show no abnormalities. The right wrist is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is mild midline cervical spine tenderness as well as tenderness along the 2^nd and 3^rd ribs on the right side. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation. Neurological examination shows no focal findings. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) shows no free intraperitoneal fluid. Bedside chest x-ray shows a fracture of the 3^rd rib on the right side and no other abnormalities. ECG is normal. Two peripheral venous catheters are placed. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

It began when he was lifting a bag of cement at work. The pain has been getting worse, and he has started to notice occasional numbness and clumsiness while walking. He has hypertension and peripheral artery disease. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide and aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 133/92 mm Hg. Peripheral pulses are palpable in all four extremities. Neurological examination shows 5/5 strength in the upper extremities and 3/5 strength in bilateral foot dorsiflexion. Sensation to light touch is diminished bilaterally over the lateral thigh area and the inner side of the lower legs. Passive raising of either the right or left leg causes pain radiating down the ipsilateral leg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In patients with progressive or severe motor deficits, saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, or bilateral symptoms (as seen in this patient), an MRI is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. In patients with disk herniation, T2 weighted MRI images typically show a hypointense disk with disk space narrowing and evidence of impingement or compression of a spinal nerve or the spinal cord (e.g., compression of the thecal sac, hyperintense edema of the spinal cord). If the patient has progressive neurological deficits, rapid assessment of the lesion is required and emergency surgical correction may be necessary.\n\nWhile disk herniation is the most likely cause of this patient’s radiculopathy, an MRI would also help to rule out a neoplastic, infectious, inflammatory, or vascular etiology of his symptoms.",

His pulse is 58/min, respirations are 17/min and regular, and blood pressure is 89/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. He has flaccid paralysis and absent reflexes in the lower extremities. Sensory examination shows absent sensation below the level of the nipples including absent sensation in the perianal region. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft. Rectal examination discloses no discernable resting tone and squeezing of the glans penis does not elicit anal sphincter contraction. The remainder of the examination, including a focused assessment with sonography for trauma, shows no abnormalities. A whole-body CT scan reveals an isolated burst fracture of the T3 vertebra with no evidence of facet injury.

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This patient presents with spinal shock (flaccid, areflexic paralysis, anesthesia below the level of the injury) and neurogenic shock (bradycardia, hypotension) due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Absent sacral sparing in the spinal shock phase correlates with a high degree of autonomic dysfunction.",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with spinal shock and absent sacral sparing will have impaired micturition reflexes (often with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) and no bladder-filling sensation. This may result in acute urinary retention with painless bladder distension and subsequent complications (e.g., hydronephrosis, worsening bradycardia from bladder distention, bladder rupture). Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is the placement of a Foley catheter. Urinary catheterization also enables the assessment of fluid balance in patients who require careful intravenous fluid therapy for the management of neurogenic shock. When fluid therapy is no longer necessary, the indwelling catheter should be replaced by an intermittent catheter (ideally 3–4 days after the injury) to decrease the risk of urinary tract infection. Intermittent catheterization to decompress the bladder also prevents autonomic dysreflexia, a late complication of SCI above T6.\n\nOther important management steps in the management of SCI include venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, decubitus ulcer prophylaxis, pain control, and bowel care. Patients with SCI should undergo repeated, thorough neurological examinations with documentation of the findings. The return of any neurological function in the sacral segments after spinal shock resolves indicates an incomplete SCI and predicts the return of some degree of bowel and bladder control. The persistence of complete neurological impairment in the sacral segments after spinal shock resolves indicates complete SCI and a poor prognosis.",

Urgent surgical stabilization of the spine is typically performed if the patient has unstable injuries (e.g., bilateral facet dislocation), especially if the injury cannot be treated with closed reduction, or if the patient has progressively worsening neurological deficits. For a patient in neurogenic shock, medical management to limit spinal cord ischemia from hypoperfusion is more important before surgery is performed.",

In patients with hypotension and bradycardia, atropine or vasopressors with additional inotropic and chronotropic effects (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine) should be used.

Intubation is performed to treat airway obstruction, to protect the airway (e.g., if the patient has or is expected to develop an altered mental status), or to allow for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure. Patients are at risk of respiratory failure due to diaphragm paralysis if the SCI is at the level of C5 or above.

She also has occasional headaches and noticed a decrease in her sense of smell lately. She has never had these symptoms before. The patient's only medication is fexofenadine for seasonal allergies. She is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 61 kg (135 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/40 in the right eye and there is minimal light perception in the left eye. In the swinging flashlight test, both of her eyes dilate as the light moves from the right to left eye. Fundoscopy shows papilledema in the right optic disc and a pale left optic disc. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Optic neuropathy causes acute visual changes, but it would not cause papilledema or anosmia. Visual field testing demonstrates a central scotoma and telangiectasias around the papilla as well as microangiopathy, none of which are seen in this patient. The lack of family history of optic neuropathy also makes hereditary neuropathy unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "Frontal lobe tumors, mainly parasellar or subfrontal meningiomas, are the most common cause of Foster-Kennedy syndrome. Anosmia is typically associated with meningiomas arising from the olfactory groove (i.e., from the cribriform plate and frontosphenoidal suture), which account for 22% of all skull base meningiomas. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is a brain MRI, which is likely to show a round, sharply demarcated space-occupying lesion (resembling a snowball) with significant contrast enhancement. Management is based on the location and grade of the tumor, as well as patient-specific factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, accompanying symptoms). Treatment that reduces elevated intracranial pressure may improve visual function.",

        "explanation_why": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of optic neuritis, especially in women of childbearing age. Optic neuritis can manifest with acute vision change and a relative afferent pupillary defect. While optic neuritis may cause papillitis, which occasionally manifests with papilledema, it does not result in optic atrophy. Also, MS typically manifests with relapsing, remitting neurologic symptoms in anatomically unrelated locations (i.e., symptoms disseminated in time and space), whereas this patient's symptoms are chronic and progressive. Less commonly, MS can cause chronic, progressive symptoms, but it does not cause elevated intracranial pressure, thus it would not explain this patient's headaches.",

On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 mL in size and a midline shift of 7 mm; no skull fracture was shown. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO_2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H_2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?",

        "explanation_why": "Critically ill patients with an intact gastrointestinal tract can receive short-term enteral feeding via nasogastric tube (< 2–3 weeks) if there are no contraindications (e.g., bowel obstruction, intractable vomiting, hemodynamic instability). Enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it stimulates intestinal motility and prevents mucosal atrophy. As long as there is no facial trauma or basilar skull fractures, a nasogastric tube can be used for enteral feeding. When feeding, patients should have their backrest elevated to prevent aspiration and reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia.",

Children who are septic from meningitis may also rarely present with retinal hemorrhages. However, bacterial meningitis typically presents more acutely, in a matter of hours or days. Additionally, this child is afebrile and has a normal white blood cell count, both of which are unexpected findings in children with meningitis, particularly in meningitis due to bacterial pathogens.",

Long-term deficits resulting from SBS include sight, hearing, and speech impairment. SBS has an extremely high mortality rate, with approx. 25% of affected children dying as a result of sustained injuries. Cranial CT scan in patients with SBS often shows additional brain injuries such as chronic subdural hematoma (which would explain this patient's subacute presentation over 2 weeks), subarachnoid bleeding, and/or diffuse punctate parenchymal hemorrhages.",

Additionally, while OI is often hard to differentiate from child abuse, the low prevalence of OI makes child abuse more likely in the general population.",

        "explanation_why": "Many rodenticides contain long-acting anticoagulants, such as super warfarin. Ingestion of these rodenticides can lead to coagulopathy and pathological bleeding, usually beginning about 24 hours after ingestion. This coagulopathy could cause both retinal hemorrhages and intracranial bleeding leading to altered mental status, as seen in this patient. However, coagulopathy would likely also manifest in other locations, causing gastrointestinal bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis, and hematuria. This patient does not have any other signs of pathological bleeding, nor would this etiology explain this patient's associated rib fractures.",

However, children undergoing long-term steroid therapy would have a Cushingoid appearance characterized by obesity (unlike this child with a weight at the 5^th percentile) and a moon-like facies.

However, Schmidt syndrome is more common among women between 20–60 years of age and is associated with elevated TSH levels (primary hypothyroidism). GH deficiency (suggested by decreased IGF-1 levels) and short stature would be unexpected. Moreover, normal serum glucose along with headache and visual field defects suggest that polyuria and polydipsia in this patient are caused by central diabetes insipidus rather than diabetes mellitus.",

Headache is caused by compression of the adjacent brain parenchyma and/or stretching of the dura mater, while visual field defects are the result of compression of the optic chiasm. A craniopharyngioma can be diagnosed by an MRI of the brain, which typically reveals a suprasellar mass that extends into the sella turcica.

Her friend's elbow struck her head, just above her left ear. She did not lose consciousness, but her mother reports that she was confused for 20 minutes after the incident and did not recall being hit. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows the head tilted toward the right shoulder. A photograph of the eyes at primary gaze is shown. The finding in the patient's left eye worsens when she is asked to look to the right side or tilt her head toward her left shoulder. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the left temporal bone. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes when tested independently. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength and sensation are intact bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Plantar reflex shows a flexor response. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient has unilateral hypertropia in the primary gaze (i.e., while looking straight ahead), which can be due to ipsilateral weakness of eye depressors or contralateral weakness of eye elevators. Worsening of this patient's hypertropia in the right lateral gaze (on left eye adduction) and when the patient tilts her head to the left shoulder (on left eye intorsion) suggests ophthalmoplegia of the left superior oblique muscle (SOM).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The trochlear nerve innervates only the superior oblique muscle (SOM), which is a depressor and intortor of the eyeball. Trochlear nerve damage, therefore, causes hypertropia and vertical diplopia, as seen here. Hypertropia due to left SOM palsy worsens during right lateral gaze because the SOM is the only muscle that can depress an adducted eye. Hypertropia due to SOM palsy also worsens when the head is tilted toward the ipsilateral shoulder because the superior rectus muscle (an elevator) takes over the role of the paralyzed SOM as the primary intortor, resulting in elevation of the eye. To decrease vertical diplopia, patients with SOM ophthalmoplegia tilt their head away from the affected side (compensatory head tilt), like this patient who tilts her head to the right. The trochlear nerve is the cranial nerve that is most commonly damaged in cases of trauma, because its long course and thin diameter make it vulnerable to shearing injury.",

Weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle results in ptosis and impairment of parasympathetic function in mydriasis (as well as loss of accommodation and pupillary light reflex, which are not shown). Patients present with horizontal or horizontal and vertical double vision (diplopia) that worsens when turning the gaze away from the affected side. The ptosis, however, may prevent patients from experiencing diplopia.",

        "explanation_why": "Damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) leads to internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which may manifest with diplopia and strabismus. However, these symptoms only manifest with gaze to the side contralateral to the lesion as a result of ipsilateral adduction weakness that occurs only during horizontal conjugate eye movements. Patients also have horizontal nystagmus in the contralateral eye with abduction, and a characteristic absence of ipsilateral adductor weakness during disconjugate movements (e.g., convergence). Moreover, trauma is an extremely rare cause of INO which more often occurs in multiple sclerosis or following a brainstem stroke.",

        "explanation_why": "In addition to bilateral acoustic neuromas, which occur in almost all individuals with NF2 by the age of 30 years, NF2 can cause multiple tumors of the nervous system, such as intracranial and spinal meningiomas, schwannomas of other cranial nerves, and ependymomas. Most meningiomas are slow-growing and patients may therefore be asymptomatic for a prolonged period of time. If symptoms do occur, they usually include general symptoms of CNS tumors (e.g., seizures) or more specific symptoms that are determined by the location of the tumor (e.g., paraparesis and/or uncontrolled micturition if the tumor arises from the falx cerebri). Other typical clinical findings of NF2 include early-onset bilateral cataracts, seizures, skin nodules, and café au lait spots (see “Overview of neurocutaneous syndromes” table).\n\nThe clinical features of acoustic neuromas are caused by compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) as a result of the tumor expanding into the internal acoustic meatus. Sensorineural hearing loss, which is the most common presenting symptom, and tinnitus are due to cochlear nerve involvement, whereas dizziness, unsteady gait, and disequilibrium indicate vestibular nerve involvement.",

Almost all cases of musculoskeletal lower back pain resolve on their own within ∼ 6 weeks. Analgesia reduces discomfort, and mild to moderate activity is associated with better outcomes than bed rest. Further testing (e.g., MRI) should be considered in patients with back pain if there is high suspicion for a serious or urgent underlying cause (e.g., spinal infection) and in individuals whose symptoms have not significantly improved after ∼ 6 weeks. Muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine or tizanidine can be used as alternatives or in combination with NSAIDs for the treatment of acute lower back pain.",

        "explanation_why": "Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated in patients if a bacterial cause of lower back pain is suspected (eg, epidural abscess, osteomyelitis). This patient is at increased risk of infection (history of IV drug use); however, he has no history of fever. Furthermore, patients with lower back pain caused by infection are typically more severely ill.",

The left optic nerve is not visualized on this image, and the mass either arises from it or displaces it. The normal-appearing right optic nerve (red overlay) is well visualized.The differential diagnosis for intraconal masses depends on whether or not the lesion is continuous with the optic nerve. Differential diagnoses for masses involving the optic nerve include, but are not limited to, meningioma, glioma, and lymphoma.

Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. On arrival, she is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 77/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Examination shows drooping of the left eyelid and a constricted left pupil. Visual acuity in both eyes is 20/20. There is no swelling of the optic discs. Muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal bilaterally. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows no abnormalities. Duplex ultrasonography of the neck shows an absent flow in the left internal carotid artery.

Spontaneous carotid artery dissections generally have a good prognosis, but patients should be treated with an anticoagulant agent for 3–6 months and/or an antiplatelet agent for one year to reduce the risk of associated cerebrovascular accidents (such as TIA).",

Although this patient had unilateral extremity weakness and amaurosis fugax, these symptoms resolved within a few minutes, suggesting a transient ischemic attack. This patient presents with ptosis and miosis without anhidrosis, indicating partial Horner syndrome, likely due to internal carotid artery dissection. Brain ischemia causes full rather than partial Horner syndrome. Furthermore, there is no evidence of ischemia on CT scan 24 hours after symptom onset.",

Although metastatic testicular cancer may cause spinal cord compression, it manifests with a mix of osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions rather than osteoblastic lesions alone. In this age group (> 60 years), lymphomas are the most common neoplasm of the testes, rather than primary testicular cancers. While metastatic lymphoma can manifest with sclerotic, lytic, or mixed bone lesions, another tumor entity is much more likely to be responsible for this patient's sclerotic bone lesions.",

Instead, the liver and lung (in that order) are the most common sites of metastases in colorectal carcinoma. The absence of symptoms associated with colorectal cancer, such as a change in bowel habits, melena or hematochezia, signs of anemia, and/or weight loss, make colon cancer unlikely.",

Prostate cancer is the most common cause of osteoblastic metastases, which manifest with increased density and sclerotic appearance on x-ray.\n\nIn most patients with metastatic prostate cancer, the digital rectal examination (DRE) reveals asymmetric areas, indurations, or frank nodules within the prostate, but the absence of findings on DRE alone does not exclude prostate cancer.",

        "explanation_why": "Subfalcine herniation is the most common cerebral herniation syndrome and is usually due to cingulate gyrus herniation under the falx cerebri, causing compression of the ipsilateral pericallosal arteries (branches of the anterior cerebral artery), leading to consequent contralateral lower limb weakness. Unlike other cerebral herniation syndromes, patients with subfalcine herniation have no pupillary changes and, in the early stages, can have a normal mental status. Severe subfalcine herniation will cause obstruction of the contralateral foramen of Monro leading to noncommunicating hydrocephalus from dilation of the contralateral lateral ventricle.\n\nThis patient's subfalcine herniation is most likely due to traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subdural hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage), given her recent fall involving head trauma. Without emergent diagnosis and treatment, expanding intracranial hemorrhage can cause rapid progression of subfalcine herniation to brainstem herniation and death. Emergency noncontrast head CT confirms the diagnosis and neurosurgical consultation is necessary for likely craniectomy.",

Her symptoms resolved after she drank some juice. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include metformin, glipizide, enalapril, and atorvastatin. She appears anxious. Examination shows decreased radial and brachial pulses on the right upper extremity. The skin over the right upper extremity is cooler than the left. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.

Hypoglycemia can manifest with lightheadedness, weakness, blurred vision, and nausea, with improvement of symptoms after oral intake of glucose (e.g., drinking juice). However, the association between arm activity (e.g., painting a mural) and her symptoms makes a drug side effect less likely. Additionally, medication side effect would not explain decreased pulses in this patient's right arm.",

Given this patient's vascular risk factors (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension), she most likely has an atherosclerotic occlusive plaque in the right subclavian artery. Reduced blood flow explains the heaviness, paresthesia, decreased pulses, and cooler skin of her right arm (i.e., upper extremity ischemia). Furthermore, exertion of the arm leads to retrograde blood flow through the vertebral artery so that the distal subclavian “steals” blood from the brain and causes her presyncopal symptoms (lightheadedness, nausea, and blurred vision) that resolve with rest.\n\nTreatment for subclavian steal syndrome involves control of atherosclerotic disease and antiplatelet therapy. Depending on the severity and location of the occlusion, percutaneous or open revascularization may be performed.",

If there is stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery, this leads to hypoperfusion of the upper extremities on the affected side (B). This is compensated by a contralateral circulation, in which there is increased blood flow from the unaffected side to the affected side via the vertebral arteries. As a result, there is hypoperfusion of the vertebrobasilar territory and corresponding central nervous system symptoms.",

However, CES typically manifests with asymmetric muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, and saddle anesthesia due to damage of the lower motor neurons, which is not consistent with this patient's symmetric muscle weakness and hyperreflexia. In addition, bowel and bladder dysfunction are late findings of CES and would not be expected within hours of injury. Lastly, because of nerve root compression, the pain usually radiates along the sensory distribution of the nerves affected.",

While bed rest can be considered in patients with severe unspecific back pain, early mobilization is indicated in most patients with back pain due to muscular or ligamentous strain.

Vancomycin is part of the recommended empiric antibiotic therapy for spinal infections. Although vancomycin has excellent coverage of gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, it does not cover gram-negative pathogens and is therefore usually administered in combination with a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for spinal infections is indicated in patients with suspected spinal epidural abscess, new or progressive neurological symptoms, and/or signs of hemodynamic instability or sepsis; if none of these features are present, antibiotic therapy can be delayed until the causative organism is identified.

        "explanation_why": "Although the falx cerebri, the supratentorial convex surface, and the sphenoidal wings are the most common locations of meningiomas, in rare cases they also occur at the foramen magnum. Since meningiomas are slow-growing tumors, patients usually present after several months to years of slowly progressive symptoms. Early features include neck pain, which is typically worse with neck flexion and maneuvers that increase ICP (e.g., coughing, sneezing). Later, patients with meningiomas at the foramen magnum present with long tract signs and a characteristic pattern of symptom distribution: sensory and motor deficits typically start in one extremity and spread to the others. Late presentation is characterized by spastic quadriparesis (hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign), gait disturbances, and lower cranial nerve palsies (CN IX–XII), which most likely accounts for this patient's dysarthria and atrophy of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.",

The mass is continuous with the adjacent thickened and enhancing dura (arrowhead). This is known as the “dural tail sign.”The dural tail sign suggests lesion originates from the dura mater.

Muscle atrophy is another common feature of syringomyelia and most commonly affects the small muscles of the hand. Other signs of lower motor neuron lesion, such as fasciculations and areflexia (rather than this patient's hyperreflexia), may also be present. While spastic paraparesis of the limbs is a possible feature of syringomyelia due to involvement of the pyramidal tract and first motor neuron, quadriparesis is uncommon.",

The pain radiates to the back of her right leg and is worse at night. She reports decreased sensation around her buttocks and inner thighs. During the last several days, she has had trouble urinating. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and was treated with lumpectomy and radiation. Her only medication is anastrozole. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows 4/5 strength in the left lower extremity and 2/5 strength in the right lower extremity. Knee and ankle reflexes are 1+ on the right. Resting anal sphincter tone is normal, but the squeeze tone is reduced. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The onset of symptoms is typically sudden, whereas this patient's symptoms have developed gradually over 3 weeks. In addition, distal paresis in patients with CMS is usually symmetric, in contrast to this patient's asymmetric weakness. Finally, CMS is not associated with decreased sensation of the thighs.",

        "explanation_why": "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) can occur following injury to the CNS and is an important differential diagnosis to consider for any neurosurgery patient presenting with hyponatremia. SIADH causes euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia. Increased activity of antidiuretic hormone decreases free-water clearance, which results in a low serum osmolality (< 280 mOsmol/kg H_2O), and inappropriately concentrated urine (> 100 mOsmol/kg H_2O). Since patients with SIADH are typically euvolemic and therefore do not retain sodium through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there will be normal to high urine sodium excretion (> 20–30 mEq/L). Given the severity of this patient's hyponatremia, she should be treated with restriction of oral fluids and administration of hypertonic saline. The correction of hyponatremia should be gradual (maximum increase of 10–12 mmol/L within 24 hours, or 0.5 mmol/L/hour) and under ICU observation, as rapid correction can lead to central pontine myelinolysis. In patients with SIADH and severe hyponatremia, the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists such as tolvaptan may be considered if serum sodium either continues to drop or fails to rise by 2 mmol/L after 24 hours.",

Furthermore, a hemorrhage from a neoplasm could manifest with the sudden onset of a severe headache and altered mental status. However, peak incidence is during the first decade of life. In addition, since most medulloblastomas arise within the cerebellum, the lack of any cerebellar signs (e.g., gait ataxia, truncal instability, intention tremor, double vision) makes medulloblastoma less likely. Fever and a 3-week history of tooth pain suggest another etiology for this patient's symptoms.",

However, most patients present with focal neurological signs and seizures, which are absent in this patient. While focal inflammation of the temporal lobe (which is commonly affected in HSV encephalitis) can cause a slight elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), this patient's sluggish pupils and bilateral papilledema suggest severely elevated ICP, which is not characteristic of HSV encephalitis. Finally, the subacute course of this patient's symptoms, with a history of toothache preceding focal left-sided headache, is not consistent with this diagnosis.",

Brain abscesses often initially manifest with headache and fever, and, as the abscess grows within the limited space of the cranial vault, patients develop signs of elevated intracranial pressure, such as vomiting, papilledema, and altered mental status, as seen here. Rupture of the abscess, which likely occurred in this patient, can cause acute worsening of headache and signs of meningeal irritation, as demonstrated by the Brudzinski sign.\n\nThis patient should undergo brain imaging (CT or MRI) to confirm the diagnosis. Needle aspiration or excision of the abscess should also be performed, both for treatment and culture sample collection. Streptococcus and Bacteroides spp. are some of the most common pathogens isolated from brain abscesses caused by odontogenic infection.",

            "description": "MRI brain (T1-weighted; axial view; with contrast) of a 5-year-old girl presenting after a seizure.\n\nAn oval-shaped well-defined structure is located within the right temporal lobe. It demonstrates smooth ring enhancement with lack of enhancement centrally (red overlay). The lack of central enhancement is due to pus (green overlay). There is low signal surrounding this structure representing edema (blue overlay). Pus and edema appear hypointense, as fluid appears as low signal on T1-weigted images. \n\nThis is an example of a brain abscess. The main other differential is a primary brain lesion or a cystic metastasis. Other MRI sequences, along with clinical information, are required to help differentiate between these differentials.",

However, most patients present with unilateral periorbital edema and proptosis from increased pressure within the cavernous sinus, and palsies of the cranial nerves located within the cavernous sinus (III, IV, V1, V2, VI), none of which are seen here. In addition, meningeal irritation, as demonstrated by the Brudzinski sign in this patient, is not characteristic of cavernous sinus thrombosis.",

Once the ventricles enlarge, homeostasis between CSF production and resorption is established and intracranial pressure normalizes.\n\nCSF shunting is the main treatment for NPH.

    "question_text": "A 5-month-old male infant is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of progressive enlargement of his head circumference. His parents report that he has been healthy except for an episode of tonsillitis 3 months ago treated with penicillin. The patient was born at term by a lower segment transverse cesarean delivery because of a transverse lie. He has met all developmental milestones. His immunizations are up-to-date.

Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality in newborns and young infants in whom the anterior fontanelle is still open because it allows direct visualization of the brain. Moreover, ultrasound does not involve radiation and does not require sedation of the patient.\n\nAlthough standard MRI is safe for infants, sedation is required, making it less appropriate than ultrasonography. Ultra-fast MRI techniques, however, do not require infant sedation and can be used as an alternative to ultrasonography. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in older children in whom the anterior fontanelle has closed (it usually closes at 12–18 months of age).",

He has been increasingly irritable over the past month, has been feeding poorly, and has had multiple episodes of vomiting. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 50^th percentile for height, 40^th percentile for weight, and 98^th percentile for head circumference. He appears lethargic. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a bulging anterior fontanelle. The child is unable to stand without support and falls if he attempts to walk. Muscle tone is increased and deep tendon reflexes are 4+ in the lower extremities. Examination of the back is unremarkable. An MRI of the brain shows symmetrical enlargement of all four ventricles. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",

    "hint": "In a patient with a history of recurrent ear infections, the combination of headache, seizures, clinical features of increased intracranial pressure (nausea and papilledema), and an MRI showing a well-defined rim-enhancing mass with surrounding edema in the temporal lobe strongly indicates a pyogenic brain abscess. Fever may be mild in this condition because the infection and immune response are at first limited to the location of the abscess.",

However, antibiotic treatment is typically initiated after a more invasive first-line procedure for diagnostic sampling has been performed. Antibiotic therapy alone may be attempted for small (< 2.5 cm) uncomplicated abscesses with a known pathogen. This patient with a large peripheral abscess and signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema) requires a more urgent management step before proceeding to antibiotic treatment, which should be initiated immediately after the first-line intervention.",

Following drainage of the abscess, intravenous empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated with a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole. Vancomycin should be added if infection with Staphylococcus is suspected (e.g., patients who develop a brain abscess following penetrating trauma or neurosurgery, or among patients with bacterial endocarditis). In addition to surgical drainage and antibiotics, patients with evidence of cerebral edema or increased ICP should be treated with a short course of glucocorticoids.\n\nAntibiotic therapy without aspiration and surgical drainage may only be attempted in patients with a small (< 2.5 cm) uncomplicated brain abscess with a known pathogen.",

The pain begins after walking one to two blocks and radiates bilaterally down the buttocks with cramping and tingling. He reports that the pain is worse while walking downhill and is relieved by sitting and leaning forward. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55 years and an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at the age of 60 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His current medications include sitagliptin, metformin, atorvastatin, metoprolol succinate, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 150/87 mm Hg. Examination shows full muscle strength. Sensation is reduced bilaterally in the feet and toes. Straight leg raise test is negative. X-ray of the spine shows degenerative changes.

    "hint": "Bilateral buttock pain that worsens with lumbar extension (e.g., walking) and is relieved by lumbar flexion (e.g., sitting, leaning forward) is consistent with neurogenic claudication, which is commonly seen in lumbar spinal stenosis.

The most characteristic findings include dull pain in the neck and lower back independent of positioning, limited mobility of the spine, and morning stiffness that improves with activity. In addition, onset is usually prior to age 40 and the disease follows a gradual, progressive course. Although the x-ray findings described in this case could indicate ankylosing spondylitis, the typical clinical features are absent in the patient, making it an unlikely diagnosis.",

Because in IIH the intracranial pressure is uniformly elevated in the ventricular system and the subarachnoid space, there is no risk of cerebral herniation and, therefore, a lumbar puncture may safely be performed. An opening pressure > 20–25 cm H_2O confirms intracranial hypertension, and normal CSF studies rule out other common causes of intracranial hypertension (e.g., meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage). Once the diagnosis is confirmed, discontinuation of potential causes (e.g., vitamin A supplements), a low-sodium weight loss program, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) would be recommended.",

During this period, she has noticed brief episodes of visual loss in both eyes lasting several seconds, especially when she suddenly stands up or bends over. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 98 kg (216 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes with mild peripheral vision loss. Fundoscopic examination shows bilateral optic disc swelling. An MRI of the brain shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed; opening pressure is 310 mm H_2O. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 4/mm^3 (75% lymphocytes), a protein concentration of 35 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 45 mg/dL.

Patients with newly-diagnosed IIH should discontinue any offending agents (e.g., vitamin A analogs, tetracyclines), adopt a low-sodium weight loss diet (if overweight), and begin acetazolamide. Although the mechanism is not clear, CAIs are believed to reduce the rate of CSF production, thereby decreasing intracranial hypertension.",

By leaning forward, the spinal canal is widened and spinal cord compression is reduced. Therefore, leaning forward will most likely relieve this patient's back pain. Activities that flex the lumbar spine, such as sitting, cycling, or walking uphill, also help widen the spinal canal and alleviate pain in patients with spinal stenosis.\n\nThe exacerbation of lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms by certain postures that narrow the spinal cord (walking downhill, standing, walking) is called pseudoclaudication. In contrast to vascular claudication, which is a result of arterial vessel narrowing and impaired metabolic demands of muscle tissue, pseudoclaudication is thought to result from increased metabolic demands of a compressed and ischemic spinal cord.",

Increased gut transit time due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy may lead to bacterial overgrowth, which can also cause vitamin B_12 deficiency. However, there is no data to suggest that patients with pernicious anemia are at an increased risk of developing type 2 DM.\n\nType 1 DM is more commonly associated with pernicious anemia because both have underlying autoimmune etiologies.",

Approximately 90% of patients with pernicious anemia have chronic atrophic gastritis, which likely accounts for the increased incidence of gastric carcinoma. These patients are also at increased risk for gastric carcinoid tumors as a result of chronic hypergastrinemia, which induces gastric cell hyperplasia.\n\nPatients with newly diagnosed pernicious anemia should undergo a single endoscopic examination and gastric biopsy within 6 months to confirm the presence of atrophic gastritis and rule out dysplastic changes. Endoscopy should be repeated if they develop dyspeptic symptoms. Surveillance endoscopies may also be performed every 3 years in certain high-risk patients (e.g., those with severe columnar metaplasia at the initial biopsy).",

He has hypertension and cirrhosis as a result of alcohol-associated liver disease. He does not smoke, and he no longer drinks alcohol. His current medications include lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide daily. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows discrete scleral icterus and jaundice. Ascites and gynecomastia are present. Neurological examination shows nystagmus with fast beats toward the left. He has dysmetria and tremor when performing left-sided finger-nose testing, and dysdiadochokinesia with rapid alternating movements. He has a wide-based gait and a pronator drift of the left arm. He has full range of motion in his arms and legs without rigidity. He has full muscle strength, and sensation to light touch is intact.

If signs of spinal cord compression are present, treatment consists of immediate neurosurgical decompression of the spinal canal via laminectomy, followed by evacuation of the hematoma. During the procedure, the dura should be inspected and active bleeding sites (usually the venous vessels) should be controlled. Any coagulopathies should be treated (e.g., with anticoagulation reversal).",

He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

She has been in good health since this treatment. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. There is a well-healed scar on the left side of the chest. There is no lymphadenopathy. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.

While WBRT was once commonly used following surgical resection to minimize local recurrence, focal radiation therapy (which has far fewer side effects) has largely replaced this treatment modality in postoperative patients.",

However, about half of these patients also have fever or neurologic deficits. Often brain abscesses arise via hematogenous or direct spread, so many of the patients affected have a concurrent infection. Although brain abscesses can also arise without concurrent infection, this patient's recent history of breast cancer increases the likelihood that her brain lesion is a metastatic tumor (that would not respond to antibiotics).",

The headaches are often accompanied by nausea and sometimes relieved by vomiting. She stopped going to her ballet lessons 2 weeks ago because she was embarrassed about falling frequently and having increasing difficulty performing the steps. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg. She has a broad-based gait. While standing with both feet together and raising her arms, closing her eyes does not affect her balance. She is unable to perform rapid, alternating movements with her hands. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Additional features include light, pale hair and blue eyes (due to decreased melanin production). Since most patients are asymptomatic until severe and often irreversible complications have occurred, direct measurement of phenylalanine levels is an important part of newborn screening for metabolic disorders.

        "explanation_why": "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication in preterm infants and usually occurs within the first five days after birth. This complication is typically seen in neonates of < 1500 g birth weight and born before 32 weeks' gestation due to the fragility of the germinal matrix. Additional risk factors include peripartal chorioamnionitis and hypoxia (as suggested by this patient's low Apgar scores). Most infants with IVH are asymptomatic, but saltatory (over several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible. Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, bulging anterior fontanelle, and neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures, cranial nerve abnormalities as suggested by poor pupillary light reflexes and roving eye movements), all of which this patient has.\n\nCranial ultrasonography is the preferred method to diagnose IVH in newborns. Since most patients are asymptomatic, screening ultrasounds are routinely performed in infants with a birth weight < 1500 g and delivery before 30 weeks' gestation.",

    "question_text": "A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of difficulty speaking. The symptoms began abruptly one hour ago while he was having breakfast with his wife. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin.

If left untreated, a pinealoma may obstruct the passage of cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space (e.g., via aqueductal stenosis) leading to obstructive hydrocephalus, a common sequela of pinealoma. Obstructive hydrocephalus typically manifests with headaches, vision abnormalities, nausea, vomiting, and impaired ambulation (e.g, ataxia) due to increased intracranial pressure.\n\nThe most common type of pinealoma in children is a pineal germinoma that typically secretes β-hCG, eventually leading to precocious puberty.",

During this period, he has had multiple episodes of dizziness and tingling sensations in his arms and hands. A year ago, he underwent closed reduction of a dislocated shoulder he sustained after a fall. He underwent surgical removal of a saclike protuberance on his lower back, soon after being born. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. His neck is supple. Neurological examination shows sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and normal gross motor function. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral optic disc swelling. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

Neurological examination shows sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and normal gross motor function. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral optic disc swelling. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

In a young patient, stroke symptoms (e.g., unilateral weakness, hyperreflexia, facial droop) and signs of DVT should raise concern for paradoxical embolism. This patient should have an immediate stroke workup (e.g., noncontrast head CT, possible thrombolysis). Furthermore, ultrasonography should be performed to confirm DVT. Because paradoxical embolism is a diagnosis of exclusion, all other causes must be excluded after the patient has been stabilized. Given the risk of pulmonary embolism and recurrent cerebral emboli, this patient should be started on anticoagulant therapy once cerebral hemorrhage is ruled out.\n\nSuspected patent foramen ovale should be confirmed with echocardiography so that it can be surgically or percutaneously closed to prevent recurrent emboli.",

He collided head-on into another player while wearing a mouthguard and helmet. Immediately after the collision, he was confused but able to use appropriate words. He opened his eyes spontaneously and followed commands. There was no loss of consciousness. He also had a headache with dizziness and nausea. Upon arrival, he is no longer confused. He feels well. Vital signs are within normal limits. He is fully alert and oriented. His speech is organized and he is able to perform tasks demonstrating full attention, memory, and balance. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the crown of his head but no signs of skin break or fracture. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

Observation in the emergency department (ED) for at least 4–6 hours should include serial neurological examination and assessment of GCS. Alterations in mental status or focal neurological signs may indicate more serious underlying pathology, such as intracranial bleeding. Following discharge, this patient should be monitored by a responsible individual for at least 24 hours after injury and return to the ED if there are any neurological changes. Patients should also progress through six stages of a gradual return to sports. As each stage requires at least 24 hours, this patient will need to refrain from contact sports for at least one week.\n\nNeuroimaging is not routinely recommended for mild TBI. If at any point during the observation period the GCS deteriorates to < 13, patients should be reclassified as having moderate TBI or severe TBI and managed accordingly.",

The mother reports that during these episodes, the boy abruptly stops what he is doing and just stares into space. She says that he sometimes also smacks his lips. The episodes typically last 1–2 minutes and occur 2–3 times per week. Initially, the boy only experienced the symptoms at school but last week he had an episode while playing baseball with his father. When his father tried to talk to him, he did not seem to listen. After the episode, he was confused for 10 minutes and too tired to play. The patient has been healthy except for an episode of otitis media 1 year ago that was treated with amoxicillin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no other abnormalities. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

Focal seizures originate in the temporal lobe and are caused by structural changes or damage to the brain (e.g., encephalitis, developmental disorders). Seizure activity is visible as temporal lobe spikes on EEG during a seizure episode; interictal EEG may be normal. This patient should undergo an MRI to determine potential underlying causes. Treatment consists of pharmacotherapy with lamotrigine or levetiracetam; surgery may be necessary for refractory disease.

Her birth weight and height were within normal limits. Her father is 174 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall; her mother is 162 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall. She is at the 98^th percentile for height and 90^th percentile for BMI. She has not had her menstrual period yet. Her mother has Graves disease. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a tall stature with broad hands and feet. There is frontal bossing and protrusion of the mandible. Finger perimetry is normal. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show a fasting serum glucose concentration of 144 mg/dL. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 15 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",

        "explanation_why": "Growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas cause gigantism in children and adolescents, and acromegaly in adults. Growth hormone (GH) stimulates IGF-1 synthesis, which in turn promotes cell proliferation, especially of the bones and cartilage. Excess GH also has a diabetogenic effect, which explains the elevated serum glucose seen in this patient. The treatment of choice for both gigantism and acromegaly is transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Pharmacotherapy with somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide) is indicated if GH excess is not completely resolved by surgery or if surgery is not possible.\n\nSee \"Etiology of tall stature\" table.",

Urine osmolality is mostly regulated by the ADH-dependent renal collecting ducts. Absent ADH will result in diluted urine (as seen in this patient). Serum potassium levels are mainly regulated by aldosterone as part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which, despite its upregulation due to initial volume depletion, does not significantly affect potassium concentrations. In addition, since ACTH does not directly affect potassium regulation by RAAS, the decreased ACTH levels due to hypopituitarism have no significant impact on potassium levels. Serum glucose concentration is mostly insulin/glucagon-dependent, but it is also regulated by cortisol (which itself is regulated by ACTH). Cortisol upregulates gluconeogenesis and decreases peripheral glucose utilization. Therefore, a decrease in cortisol secretion will result in hypoglycemia.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient most likely has an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) due to rupture of a small penetrating artery in the subcortical region of the left cerebral hemisphere. Arterial hypertension, as seen in this patient, is the single most important predisposing factor for intracerebral hemorrhage because it causes lipohyalinosis. Acute peaks in blood pressure can then lead to rupture of these weakened vessels, which was the likely mechanism of rupture in this patient. A noncontrast CT scan of the head characteristically shows a solitary hyperdense lesion surrounded by hypodense edema (most commonly within the basal ganglia or internal capsule).",

The clinical presentation ranges from acute loss of consciousness followed by severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and impaired memory and cognition to chronic, insidious onset of these symptoms over days or weeks following the initial trauma. Increased intracranial pressure may develop, resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion and focal neurologic deficits. However, a CT scan of the head would characteristically show a crescent-shaped, concave hemorrhage that crosses suture lines. In addition, risk factors for subdural hematoma include old age, cerebral atrophy, chronic alcohol consumption, and anticoagulation therapy, none of which are seen here.",

In contrast, other sites of supratentorial hemorrhage typically cause a gaze deviation toward the side of the lesion (i.e., away from the affected side of the body). This patient’s left-sided weakness and sensory loss, miotic nonreactive pupils, and leftward and downward deviation of her eyes are best explained by a stroke in the right thalamus.\n\nNote that the thalamus is a relatively large region of the brain and thalamic stroke has a variety of manifestations (e.g., pure sensory stroke in lacunar syndromes).

To open her eyes, the patient must contract the frontalis muscle, resulting in the forehead wrinkles seen in image B. Both eyes deviate outwards (exotropia) and downwards (hypotropia) from the primary gaze position. This occurs due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, which are the only unaffected extraocular muscles. Mydriasis indicates involvement of the parasympathetic portion of the oculomotor nerve.Ptosis, mydriasis, exotropia, and hypotropia are the classic signs of complete oculomotor palsy. Complete oculomotor palsy is more commonly unilateral than bilateral.",

            "description": "Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells and primarily originate within the vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII. The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

This tumor most commonly presents with noncommunicating hydrocephalus, which can result in compression of a number of CNS structures and cause vertical gaze palsy and central precocious puberty. However, in the case of hydrocephalus due to an ependymoma, symptoms of hydrocephalus (e.g., irritability, urinary incontinence) would precede the onset of vertical gaze palsy unlike this patient who had a vertical gaze palsy before the onset of hydrocephalus symptoms.",

Because the pituitary gland is not in close proximity to the ventricular system, hydrocephalus does not occur. In addition, pituitary tumors originating from gonadotropic cells (gonadotroph adenoma) are typically nonsecretory (inactive), resulting in hypogonadism due to the destruction of functioning gonadotropic cells, instead of precocious puberty.",

    "hint": "Dissociated sensory loss (dysesthetic pain and absent temperature sensation with normal fine touch sensation) occurs as a result of the anterior white commissure compression. This finding in a cape-like distribution (upper extremities and upper chest) indicates a central cord syndrome of the cervicothoracic spinal cord (most likely at the level of the C5–T1 spinal nerves). The most likely cause of the condition in this patient is syringomyelia secondary to a whiplash injury.",

        "explanation_why": "In syringomyelia, damage to the anterior horn cells by an expanding syrinx would cause features of lower motor neuron injury (e.g., hyporeflexia, flaccid paresis) at the level of the syrinx. Since the syrinx is most likely located at the level of the C5–T1 spinal nerves and the anterior horn cells that form the efferent arc of the biceps reflex are located at the level of the C5 and C6 spinal nerves, the patient is at risk of developing a decreased or absent rather than exaggerated biceps reflex. Features of upper motor neuron injury (e.g., hyperreflexia) can occur below the level of the syrinx due to damage to the upper motor neurons in the medial part of the lateral corticospinal tracts.",

        "explanation_why": "The anal wink reflex is controlled by the pudendal nerve and nerve fibers arising from the sacral region, specifically at the level of S3 to S5. The absence of sacral sparing is characteristic of complete spinal cord injury. Patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries such as central cord syndrome typically have sacral sparing (i.e., an unaffected anal wink reflex or bulbocutaneous reflex) because the corticospinal fibers that innervate the anterior horn cells of the sacral segments are located in the lateral-most part of the corticospinal tract.",

The motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve is located in the pons and is unlikely to be affected by the cervical syrinx.

Damage to these neurons results in central Horner syndrome, which manifests with ptosis, i.e., drooping of the eyelid (because the superior tarsal muscle is sympathetically innervated), miosis, and anhidrosis.\n\nAs the syrinx expands, the patient will develop features of LMN injury at the syrinx's level (due to damage to the anterior horn cells) and features of UMN injury below the level of the syrinx (due to damage to the medial parts of the lateral corticospinal tract).",

A PFO is considered an abnormal anatomical variant of the heart and is present in ∼ 25% of the general population. In addition to a stroke workup (i.e., noncontrast head CT, possible thrombolysis, etc.), this patient should also undergo compression ultrasonography to confirm DVT. Because of the risk of pulmonary embolism and recurrent cerebral emboli, this patient should be started on anticoagulant therapy once cerebral hemorrhage is ruled out and undergo echocardiography to evaluate for surgical closure of the PFO.",

        "explanation_why": "Inhibition of folate absorption in the mother due to valproic acid intake leads to an increased risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida in the embryo, which may require lower spinal surgery after birth. Valproic acid may also cause cognitive impairment, facial, cardiovascular (e.g., ASD), and skeletal abnormalities (e.g., polydactyly), meaning that it should be avoided during pregnancy. The antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine should also be avoided because they may cause fetal hydantoin syndrome. Teratogenesis occurs most often during the 3^rd–8^th embryologic week when organogenesis is occurring. Since there is no antiepileptic drug that is not teratogenic, an antiepileptic drug should be chosen that controls seizures and is tolerated well by the mother at the lowest effective dose.",

The S1 nerve root controls plantar flexion through the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, so weakness in these muscles can lead to a diminished Achilles tendon reflex and impaired toe walking. Additionally, the S1 nerve root controls sensation in the dorsolateral aspect of the thigh, the posterior calf, and the lateral side of the foot, which explains this patient's radiating pain in these regions.",

Prolactin inhibits the synthesis and release of GnRH, which results in low levels of FSH and LH secretion. Low levels of LH lead to low production of testosterone in testicular Leydig cells. In men, the lack of testosterone can cause erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, reduced testicular volume, impaired fertility, and loss of axillary hair. Pituitary macroadenomas may cause headaches and bitemporal hemianopsia due to compression of the surrounding structures (e.g., optic chiasm).",

Increased TSH in a hypothyroid patient suggests primary hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, decreased T3 and T4 levels stimulate the hypothalamus to release TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone), which in turn increases TSH secretion by the anterior pituitary. In addition to increasing TSH production, excessive TRH also stimulates the lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary to release prolactin, resulting in hyperprolactinemia.",

        "explanation_why": "A pure motor stroke is caused by infarction in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, which contains the corticospinal and corticobulbar fibers that innervate the motor nuclei on the contralateral side. Therefore, a lesion at this site can cause contralateral hemiplegia as well as weakness in the lower half of the face because the region of the facial nerve nucleus that supplies the lower half of the face only receives unilateral corticobulbar innervation. Other cranial nerve nuclei as well as the region of the facial nerve nucleus that innervates the forehead receive bilateral corticobulbar innervation and are therefore spared. The most common cause of stroke in this region is a lacunar stroke of the lenticulostriate artery (a branch of the middle cerebral artery).\n\nSince the internal capsule also contains somatosensory fibers, some patients with lacunar stroke in the internal capsule may present with sensory loss in addition to hemiparesis. This form of lacunar stroke is referred to as sensorimotor stroke and may be confused with middle cerebral artery stroke.",

Bulbar corticonuclear fibers extend to each of the cranial nerve nuclei, which innervate the facial muscles. The remaining fibers descend from the brainstem as two divisions of the corticospinal tract. Approximately 80% of these fibers decussate at the level of the medulla (pyramidal decussation) to the contralateral side to form the lateral corticospinal tract. They then descend into the spinal cord to innervate the limbs and digits. The remaining approximately 20% of fibers descend from the brainstem ipsilaterally, forming the anterior corticospinal tract. These decussate at the spinal level of the trunk muscles they innervate.",

While PH may present very similarly, the attacks are usually more frequent (≥ 5 per day) and often shorter. In cluster headache, NSAIDs like indomethacin are generally not recommended because their onset of action is too slow.",

They abort the headache and provide resolution of the conjunctival injection associated with these attacks. The exact mechanism is unclear, but it is thought to involve the vasoconstriction of cranial blood vessels in response to stimulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Inhalation of 100% oxygen is also effective in terminating acute episodes of cluster headache and has a rapid onset of action.\n\nTriptans are also the treatment of choice for severe migraine attacks.",

While the pain associated with TTH is usually holocephalic or bifrontal, and cranial autonomic symptoms, as seen in this patient, do not occur; migraine is characterized by episodes of typically unilateral headache lasting 4–72 hours accompanied or preceded by nausea, phono- and photophobia, and/or aura, which are absent in this patient. Furthermore, while patients with migraine tend to rest motionlessly in a quiet, dark room, this patient prefers to pace around during the episodes of pain.",

Classical trigeminal neuralgia is caused by neurovascular compression, most often by an aberrant loop of a neighboring artery (usually the superior cerebellar artery). The pain is typically very severe in intensity, has a sharp, stabbing quality, and lasts several seconds. Attacks can occur without provocation but are sometimes triggered by stimuli such as brushing teeth.",

While most patients are asymptomatic at birth, half of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have seizures with cerebral foci, a lag of psychomotor development and a musty body odor by 4–6 months of age. Additional features include light, pale hair and blue eyes (due to decreased melanin production). Since most patients are asymptomatic until severe and often irreversible complications have occurred, direct measurement of phenylalanine levels is an important part of newborn screening for metabolic disorders.

        "explanation_why": "Germinal matrix hemorrhage is the underlying cause of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in preterm infants. IVH is a common complication in preterm infants that usually occurs within the first five days after birth. It is typically seen in neonates weighing < 1500 g and born before 32 weeks' gestation due to the fragility of the germinal matrix. Additional risk factors include peripartal chorioamnionitis and hypoxia (as suggested by this patient's low Apgar scores). Most infants with IVH are asymptomatic, but saltatory (over several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible. Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, seizures, bulging anterior fontanelle, cranial nerve abnormalities (e.g., pupil reacting sluggishly to light), and changes in eye movement (e.g., roving eye movements), all of which this patient has.\n\nCranial ultrasonography is the preferred method to diagnose IVH in the newborn. Since most patients are asymptomatic, screening ultrasounds are routinely performed in infants with a birth weight < 1500 g and delivery before 30 weeks' gestation.",

Reactivation of T. gondii usually occurs in the CNS of immunocompromised patients, resulting in toxoplasmic encephalitis (which presents with fever, headache, impaired vigilance, seizures, and focal neurological deficits) and multiple ring-enhancing cerebral lesions on imaging. For this reason, HIV patients with a CD4 count < 100/mm^3 are typically started on toxoplasmosis prophylaxis with TMP-SMX to reduce the chance of reactivation, as is the case in this patient. This patient's solitary cerebral lesion, the CSF analysis result (positive for EBV DNA), and prophylaxis history make toxoplasmosis less likely.",

The condition can present with focal neurological deficits, neuropsychiatric symptoms, signs of elevated intracranial pressure, and/or seizures.

        "explanation_why": "Post-traumatic syringomyelia can occur months to years after whiplash-type injury to the neck and presents with the classical findings of a central cord syndrome. Patients develop a symmetric cape-like distribution of pain and temperature sensory loss around the upper trunk, shoulders and upper limbs. Vibration and position sense are selectively spared because fibers of the posterior columns decussate higher up in the medulla. As syringomyelia progresses, lower motor neuron weakness develops symmetrically in the upper limbs (evident by areflexia and fasciculations in this patient) because the fluid-filled cavity begins to compress the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord at the level of the lesion. Syringomyelia is commonly associated with Chiari type I malformation.\n\nAs the lesion expands, the patient will develop an upper motor neuron palsy of the lower extremities and lower half of the trunk (due to involvement of the corticospinal tracts), as well as complete sensory loss below the level of the lesion (including loss of vibration and position sense). However, sensations around the sacral region will usually be spared.",

        "explanation_why": "Cervical disk prolapse can lead to nerve root compression (radiculopathy), which may present with dysesthesia as well as sensory and/or motor deficits. However, neurological symptoms produced by disc prolapse are usually unilateral and localized to the distribution of the compressed nerve root. It is very unlikely that nerve root compression is the cause of this patient's symmetrical distribution of deficits; many nerve roots would have to be compressed simultaneously on both sides. In addition, all sensations are usually affected by nerve root compression, and the preservation of vibration and positional sense suggests a different diagnosis.",

Congenital syphilis can manifest with hydrocephalus, but this child does not present with other findings consistent with this condition (e.g., hepatomegaly and jaundice, Hutchinson teeth, mulberry molars, facial or skeletal alterations, generalized lymphadenopathy). In addition, this patient's mother does not have a history compatible with syphilis.",

        "explanation_why": "Signs of upper motor neuron damage (e.g., spasticity, hyperreflexia) are common in advanced, chronic hydrocephalus due to stretching of the motor cortices and pyramidal tracts around the dilated ventricles. The lower extremities are typically affected because the cortical regions responsible for processing the motor functions of the lower extremities are located in the medial precentral gyrus (according to the motor homunculus), which is the most stretched part of the primary motor cortex in patients with hydrocephalus. Other symptoms of hydrocephalus in children include difficulty feeding, irritability, and macrocephaly.\n\nAnother classic finding in congenital toxoplasmosis is diffuse intracranial calcifications. Pregnant women should avoid raw meats and contact with cat litter to prevent toxoplasmosis.",

The development of a syrinx in the center of the cervical spinal cord progressively compresses neurons of the spinothalamic tract, which explains the loss of pain (and typically temperature) sensation in the upper extremities. Later findings can include weakness or even paralysis as alpha motor neurons become compromised. Hydrocephalus is not associated with this finding.",

Other nerves that can be injured in skull base fractures involving the superior orbital fissure are the oculomotor nerve (ptosis with a fixed and dilated pupil), trochlear nerve (ocular extorsion and vertical diplopia), and ophthalmic nerve (absent corneal reflex). CN VI palsy is the most common cranial nerve palsy because of the long and tortuous route that CN VI takes intracranially, along which the nerve is vulnerable to injury by trauma (as in this patient), neoplasms (e.g., sphenoid ridge meningiomas), increased ICP (e.g., pseudotumor cerebri, SAH), neurovascular pathologies (e.g., cavernous sinus thrombosis, carotid-cavernous fistulas), and infection (e.g., syphilis).",

Because muscles responsible for eyelid and forehead movements are innervated by upper motor neuron fibers from both hemispheres, their function is preserved in central facial palsy. In peripheral facial palsy, damage to lower motor neuron (LMN) fibers results in ipsilateral paralysis of all facial muscles. Because sensory and autonomic fibers join the lower motor neuron fibers of the facial nerve in its peripheral course, peripheral facial palsies can also manifest with non-motoric symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's transtentorial uncal herniation is most likely caused by the mass effect exerted by the SDH. Initially, the displaced uncus exerts pressure primarily on the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle and oculomotor nerve, possibly resulting in contralateral hemiparesis (due to compression of the corticospinal tract) and ipsilateral fixed and dilated pupil (Hutchinson pupil), respectively. As herniation develops, the contralateral cerebral peduncle and oculomotor nerve are pushed against the contralateral tentorial notch, resulting in paradoxical ipsilateral hemiparesis and contralateral Hutchinson pupil. This combination of false localizing signs is called Kernohan phenomenon.\n\nAs herniation progresses, the brainstem may be compressed and caudally displaced, shearing the vessels and leading to midbrain and pontine hemorrhages, which result in coma, apnea, impaired circulation, and death.",

Tongue deviation results from damage to the hypoglossal nucleus, which is located in the medulla rather than the cerebral peduncle. Compression of the hypoglossal nucleus is therefore commonly associated with skull base fractures, neoplasms, and strokes, and is rarely seen in uncal herniation with cerebral peduncle compression.",

        "explanation_why": "Subfalcine herniation is the most common cerebral herniation syndrome and is usually due to cingulate gyrus herniation under the falx cerebri, causing compression of the foramen of Monro (leading to hydrocephalus and consequent headache) and branches of the anterior cerebral artery (causing infarction in the ACA territory and consequent contralateral lower limb weakness). This patient's herniation is most likely due to traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subdural hemorrhage), given his recent fall involving head trauma. Without emergent diagnosis and treatment, expanding intracranial hemorrhage can rapidly progress to brainstem herniation and death.\n\nThe next steps would be confirmation of the diagnosis with emergency noncontrast head CT and neurosurgical consultation for likely craniectomy.",

        "explanation_why": "Low insulin levels are seen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in which pancreatic beta cells are destroyed, resulting in persistently elevated serum glucose levels. This patient's hyperglycemia is instead due to the endocrinopathy of acromegaly, in which excess growth hormone (GH) levels stimulate gluconeogenesis, causing a state of insulin resistance. Hyperglycemia then induces compensatory hyperinsulinemia; therefore, elevated serum insulin levels would be expected in this patient.",

Excess secretion of GH stimulates IGF-1 synthesis, which in turn stimulates cell growth and proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis. IGF-1 is part of the negative feedback cycle that governs normal GH production, so IGF-1 levels are high in response to the pathologically elevated GH levels.\n\nIGF-1 is the most reliable indicator of acromegaly and measurement of IGF-1 levels is the first step in diagnosing patients with suspected acromegaly.

The lateral corticospinal tract decussates at the level of the medulla. An injury distal to the decussation (e.g., at the level of T1) would, therefore, affect ipsilateral motor function below the level of the injury. In a full Brown-Sequard syndrome (e.g., hemisection of the spinal cord), there would also be ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception below T1 (dorsal column), ipsilateral Babinski sign (lateral corticospinal tract), and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation beginning two levels below the lesion (lateral spinothalamic tract).",

    "hint": "Patients with large strokes are at increased risk of developing cerebral edema in the early post-stroke period. An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema can cause impaired consciousness, papilledema, and an increase in blood pressure with a reduction in heart rate (Cushing reflex).",

In acute strokes, vasoregulation is often lost and adequate cerebral oxygenation depends directly on the mean arterial pressure. Aggressive blood pressure reduction in this patient should be avoided as it may result in reduced perfusion and increased secondary neurologic injury.",

Hyperventilation leads to a reduction in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO_2) which leads to vasoconstriction with subsequent reduction in cerebral blood flow and fall in intracranial pressure. Current guidelines recommend titrating the respiratory rate to achieve a target pCO_2 of between 28–32 mm Hg.",

Patients with Broca aphasia are aware of their impaired speech and can become frustrated during the physical examination, but this patient is unaware of his language deficits. Inability to repeat single words and impaired language comprehension are not typically seen in Broca aphasia.",

This phenomenon is known as hydrocephalus ex vacuo but unlike true hydrocephalus, there is no primary pathology of cerebrospinal fluid production or outflow in patients with Alzheimer disease. This patient's normal gait and lack of urinary symptoms are important in differentiating this presentation of Alzheimer disease from the classic presentation of hydrocephalus, given that the neuroimaging findings in both conditions are similar.",

Other features of uncal herniation include cortical blindness with contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing due to compression of the posterior cerebral artery, and Kernohan phenomenon due to compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle. A downward shift of the brainstem causes hemorrhages and compression of the reticular formation, which can lead to impaired consciousness and, ultimately, death.\n\nA CN III injury can also be caused by an aneurysm or bleed of the posterior communicating artery or posterior cerebral artery, both of which are in close proximity to this nerve.",

    "hint": "This patient's progressive worsening headache, chemosis, cranial nerve VI palsy (impaired right-sided lateral gaze), increased intracranial pressure (evidenced by headache and bilateral papilledema), and the occlusive lesion in a cerebral sinus on imaging indicate cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).",

        "explanation_why": "Administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), such as dalteparin, is the most appropriate next step in the management of a patient with acute (aseptic) CVT because LMWH prevents the formation of a new clot while allowing the body to dissolve the existing thrombus. The typical duration is two weeks, after which treatment is switched to an extended duration oral anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin). The specific agent and exact duration of treatment, however, are variable as no consensus guidelines exist to guide this therapy. In the rare event of progressive neurological compromise despite adequate anticoagulation, local thrombolysis may also be required.\n\nRisk factors for CVT include oral contraceptive use (as seen here), pregnancy, coagulation disorders, and malignancy.",

In patients who present with headache, vomiting, bilateral optic disc swelling on ophthalmoscopy or cranial nerve palsies, elevated D-dimer levels can support the diagnosis of CVT.

However, a history of fever and neck rigidity would not be expected with a choroid plexus papilloma, and the MRI would also show a well-defined, intraventricular, lobulated mass that enhances brilliantly because of its high vascularization.",

The blockage of arachnoid granulations by degenerating neutrophils and proliferating fibroblasts (i.e., arachnoid scarring) is a complication of bacterial meningitis. This blockage results in the accumulation of CSF in the subarachnoid space and the ventricular spaces, the subsequent symmetric enlargement of the entire ventricular system (communicating hydrocephalus), and features of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., early-morning headaches, nausea, vomiting). Communicating hydrocephalus can also be a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage.",

The fourth ventricle is located in the rhomboid fossa (dorsal to the pons/medulla oblongata). The lateral ventricles are connected to the third ventricle via the interventricular foramina. The third ventricle is connected to the fourth ventricle by the cerebral aqueduct. The fourth ventricle also connects the ventricular system to the subarachnoid space (which is also filled with CSF) via several openings (e.g., the median aperture).",

The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

The left optic nerve is not visualized on this image, and the mass either arises from it or displaces it. The normal-appearing right optic nerve (red overlay) is well visualized.The differential diagnosis for intraconal masses depends on whether or not the lesion is continuous with the optic nerve.

Six months ago, she underwent right upper lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. Since her last office visit, her speech has changed. She now makes awkward pauses in her sentences and breaks down words into separate syllables. On physical examination, her movements are uncoordinated and she leans to the right side when standing up. A CT scan of the brain shows a well-circumscribed tumor in her right cerebellar hemisphere. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present on physical examination in this patient?",

This condition most commonly affects older adults (> 50 years of age) and usually manifests with neck pain (which can radiate to the arms due to concomitant nerve root compression), paresthesias, sensory deficits (e.g., impaired light touch sensation and dull discrimination/pain sensation), findings of lower motor neuron injury at the level of the lesion (e.g., hyporeflexia), and findings of upper motor neuron injury below the level of the lesion (e.g., hyperreflexia, Babinski sign). Diminished biceps reflex in this patient suggests a lesion at the level of C5-C6, the most commonly affected region. Other manifestations of CSM include gait instability and, less frequently, bladder dysfunction. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI.",

ASAS can also manifest with signs of lower motor neuron (LMN) injury (e.g., decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia) in the acute stages. However, patients with ASAS do not present with findings of LMN and UMN injury at different levels at the same time. Moreover, the ASA supplies the anterior ⅔ of the spinal cord, so its occlusion typically causes loss of temperature and pain sensation (due to ischemia of the spinothalamic tracts) but no loss of light touch sensation, for which the dorsal columns (supplied by the posterior spinal arteries) are responsible. Finally, since the artery of Adamkiewicz is the most commonly occluded artery, the arms are not typically involved in ASAS; affected individuals usually present only with involvement of the lower extremities.",

They should also be involved in and encouraged to discuss all aspects of care (i.e., physical, psychosocial, spiritual). This should also apply in a palliative setting, where the goal is to relieve suffering and provide the best possible quality of life. Parental consent must be obtained before proceeding with any medical procedure (e.g., placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or treatment decision (e.g., transfer to hospice care). Disclosure to the child should be adapted according to age and developmental level.",

The decision of whether and how to explain the prognosis to a pediatric patient is highly individual and depends on the patient's cognitive development. Although preschoolers (< 6 years of age) are often unable to conceptualize death, it is important to help them understand their situation by giving simple and concrete information and with the help of trained specialists and creative approaches (e.g., music therapy, puppets). As children become more mature, their understanding of death develops and it may be appropriate for them to participate in medical decisions. Although this patient may benefit from disclosure about the prognosis of his condition, another aspect of palliative care should be addressed at this point.",

The episode lasted for 1 minute and was followed by nonbloody vomiting. The mother reports that the seizure started after the boy fell down the stairs while crawling around the house. He has also become increasingly irritable and refused to feed for the past few days. She says there have not been other episodes of seizure or history of trauma. The boy's immunizations are up-to-date. He appears lethargic. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. He has a pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There are multiple purple and yellow skin discolorations around his chest and back at the level of the 6^th rib bilaterally. Results of initial laboratory studies are pending. CT scan of the head shows a thin, extraparenchymal, crescent-shaped, heterogeneous lesion that crosses the cranial sutures on the anterolateral aspect of the left hemisphere. In addition to intensive care and neurosurgical consultation, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "An extraparenchymal, crescent-shaped lesion that crosses the cranial sutures is consistent with a subdural hematoma (SDH), which is typically caused by tears in bridging veins due to sudden acceleration and/or deceleration. Without a plausible history, SDH in conjunction with bruises (purple and yellow skin discoloration) around the thorax at the level of the same rib (indicating a firm grip at this region) should raise concerns for shaken baby syndrome (SBS), a form of physical child abuse.",

Children below 2 years of age are prone to developing traumatic brain injury if they are shaken violently because they have a relatively large head, poor neck tone, increased water content of the brain, and flat skull base (which permits the brain to move easily). After stabilizing the patient, a skeletal survey and fundoscopy should be performed in all cases of suspected child abuse in order to evaluate for signs that cannot be detected on physical examination. Findings that support physical child abuse include multiple fractures at different stages of healing, metaphyseal and epiphyseal corner fractures, posterior rib fractures, spiral diaphyseal fractures of long bones (e.g., humerus), retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous hemorrhage. Suspected child abuse warrants an immediate notification of Child Protective Services.",

        "explanation_why": "Withdrawal bleeding after a progesterone challenge test can be observed in amenorrheic women with anovulatory cycles (e.g., due to polycystic ovary syndrome). These cycles, in which no corpus luteum (and, therefore, no progesterone) is produced, result in unopposed hyperestrogenism and absent/irregular endometrial shedding, which lead to menstrual irregularities (e.g., amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea). Sheehan syndrome causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, resulting in decreased levels of both estrogen and progesterone. Therefore, withdrawal bleeding would only be expected after a combined estrogen and progesterone challenge test rather than a progesterone challenge test alone.",

Sheehan syndrome, however, causes secondary adrenal insufficiency (i.e., due to ACTH deficiency). Since aldosterone is regulated by the RAAS system, which is independent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, it remains unchanged in patients with Sheehan syndrome. In this patient with hypotension, aldosterone would most likely be increased.",

Although it is rare (as the posterior pituitary receives its blood supply from a high-pressure arterial system, being less prone to ischemia than the anterior pituitary), central DI is associated with Sheehan syndrome, not nephrogenic DI.

        "explanation_why": "An empty sella turcica is a common imaging finding in patients with Sheehan syndrome. The anterior pituitary gland receives its blood supply from a relatively low-pressure arterial system and is, therefore, vulnerable to ischemia and infarction. During pregnancy, hypertrophy of prolactin-producing regions increases the size of the pituitary gland, making it very sensitive to ischemia, e.g., secondary to prolonged or severe postpartum bleeding, which has occurred in this patient. In the months following the initial ischemic insult, the pituitary gland progressively atrophies, resulting in an empty sella turcica on brain imaging. Since the pattern of hormone deficiency may vary depending on the extent of pituitary necrosis, each hormone deficiency must be tested individually.",

    "question_text": "A 76-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son because of a 2-day history of increasing confusion and headache. He has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and carotid artery stenosis. The patient has been prescribed lisinopril, atorvastatin, apixaban, and aspirin but does not always adhere to his medication regimen according to his son.

Blunt head trauma due to a fall can cause shearing of the bridging veins, leading to an SDH. This patient's alcohol consumption and advanced age increase his risk of fall-related injury. Antithrombotic therapy, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and cerebral atrophy (due to advanced age) are additional factors that make him particularly susceptible to SDH. Symptoms of acute SDH typically develop within 3 days after the inciting event and include altered mental status (e.g., confusion), headache, and focal neurological signs (e.g., contralateral hemiparesis), as seen here.\n\nUnlike acute SDH, chronic SDH has an insidious onset with symptoms manifesting ≥ 3 weeks after the event.

During this time, she reports “feeling insecure while walking” and “finding it hard to lift my feet off the ground.” She has hypertension treated with lisinopril. There is no family history of malignancy or neurological disease. She is oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg. On neurologic examination, no sensory changes are present. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ in all extremities. She has a broad-based gait; when asked to turn 180 degrees, she has to take multiple small steps. MRI of the brain shows marked dilation of the lateral ventricles. There is mild narrowing of the sulci disproportionate to the degree of ventricular enlargement. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Although this patient does not have the classic triad of symptoms, gait apraxia is the most relevant finding of NPH and should, therefore, raise clinical suspicion for this condition and warrant further evaluation. NPH is diagnosed based on typical clinical features, supportive findings on imaging (i.e., ventriculomegaly without or out of proportion to sulcal enlargement), and normal or only mildly elevated opening pressure. To evaluate opening pressure, a lumbar tap test should be performed in patients with suspected NPH. Normal or mildly elevated opening pressure and gait improvement following CSF removal (30–50 mL) strongly support the diagnosis. The latter can help predict response to cerebral shunt placement. CSF analysis can also be performed during this procedure to help rule out differential diagnoses.",

These tumors are typically located in the supratentorial white matter of the cerebral hemispheres (e.g., left temporal lobe), and may cross the midline (i.e., butterfly glioma).

A neurologic examination performed by a resident at the time of admission showed nonreactive pupils and absent brainstem and deep tendon reflexes; a CT scan of the head showed a massive epidural hematoma. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, and not receiving any paralytic or sedative medications. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows dilated, nonreactive pupils and absent corneal, gag, and cough reflexes. There is no eye movement upon irrigation of the external auditory canal with cold water. She does not respond to painful stimuli applied to the shins, sternum, and temporomandibular joint. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the right ankle and 2+ in the left biceps. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference range. Urinary toxicology screening is negative. The apnea test is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The absence of the pupillary reflex, vestibuloocular reflex, corneal reflex, gag reflex, and cough reflex indicate brainstem areflexia, which is one of the criteria for brain death. The presence of cardiac activity and spontaneous or reflex motor responses as a result of bioelectrical activity restricted to the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and muscles (e.g., deep tendon reflexes, Babinski sign, fasciculations, myoclonus) should not be interpreted as evidence against brain death.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "To determine brain death, a physician must first identify evidence of a known cause for irreversible brain damage (e.g., a massive epidural hematoma on imaging) and exclude confounders (e.g., sedative/paralytic use, drug intoxication, severe metabolic derangements, hypotension, hypothermia). The physician must then demonstrate via examination that the patient is comatose, does not have brain-mediated motor responses (e.g., decorticate or decerebrate posturing, facial grimacing) to noxious stimuli applied above and below the neck, has brainstem areflexia, and has a positive apnea test. Finally, the evaluation must be independently repeated by another physician and the findings on reevaluation must be in concordance with the first physician's findings. For children and patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, an observation period is required before the reevaluation. If all of these criteria are met, brain death can be declared without performing any ancillary testing.\n\nAncillary testing using a brain blood flow study (e.g., cerebral angiography, cerebral scintigraphy, transcranial Doppler) or an electrophysiological study (e.g., electroencephalography, evoked potentials) is indicated if any of the aforementioned criteria are not met, if any of the steps of the examination cannot be performed or yield inconclusive results, and for children below 1 year of age. If organ procurement from the patient is being considered, none of the physicians involved in determining brain death can be involved in the organ transplantation process or care of the organ recipient.",

Therefore, injury (e.g., cerebral contusion, hemorrhage, ischemia) to the frontal lobe(s) can result in personality changes, loss of inhibition and impulse control, emotional lability, impaired judgment, and/or inappropriate social interactions.\n\nCerebral contusions are associated with severe intracranial complications and therefore require close observation for at least 24 hours. Given the size of this patient's contusion (> 1 cm) and the presence of confusion, he will most likely require inpatient observation and further neurological evaluation. In patients with worsening symptoms (e.g., progressive neurologic deterioration, increased intracranial pressure, hemorrhage volume > 20 mL), decompressive craniotomy may be considered.",

        "explanation_why": "Neuroimaging is indicated for all patients with suspected TIA within 24 hours of presentation to rule out stroke. Diffusion-weighted MRI is the preferred imaging modality because it shows even small ischemic changes within 30 minutes after onset (while a CT scan shows changes only after 6–24 hours) and can differentiate acute from chronic lesions. If MRI is not available, a CT scan of the head can be performed. Besides neuroimaging, antiplatelet therapy should be initiated urgently because TIA is associated with a high risk of subsequent stroke. If TIA is confirmed, further workup to identify the underlying etiology is indicated. This workup includes neurovascular imaging to assess arterial causes (e.g., carotid Doppler ultrasound for carotid artery stenosis) and, in patients with suspected embolic source or unknown TIA etiology, cardiac evaluation (e.g., ECG, transthoracic ultrasonography). In addition, secondary prevention of TIA, including lifestyle modifications (e.g., smoking cessation) and management of chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus), should be initiated.\n\nIn patients with persistent neurologic symptoms (i.e., patients with suspected stroke), the diagnostic workup for stroke should be initiated immediately. A noncontrast CT scan of the head is then indicated to rule out intracranial hemorrhage prior to further management (e.g., thrombolysis).",

In addition, all patients with TIA should receive antiplatelet therapy at the time of the diagnosis. Reassessment in 24 hours is therefore not an appropriate management approach at this point.",

        "explanation_why": "In all patients with VHL disease older than 11 years, MRI of the brain and spine to screen for CNS hemangioblastoma is recommended at the time of diagnosis and biennially (i.e., every 2 years) if the initial MRI is normal. Hemangioblastomas, which are the most common tumors associated with VHL disease, most frequently occur in the cerebellum, brainstem, spine, and retina. CNS hemangioblastomas are the main cause of death in patients with VHL disease. Further manifestations of VHL disease include bilateral renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal, pancreatic, and/or adrenal cysts, and cystadenomas. Active surveillance guidelines that take into account the typical age of onset of associated lesions ensure early detection of these conditions. In a patient diagnosed with VHL disease, additional screening modalities include annual eye examination and blood pressure measurement from infancy, annual plasma/urinary metanephrines measurement starting at age 5 years, a biennial audiogram starting at age 11 years, biennial abdominal MRI starting at age 15 years, and a one-time MRI of the internal auditory canal in patients older than 15 years.\n\nAny patient presenting with CNS or retinal hemangioblastoma before the age of 50 years should undergo testing for VHL disease.",

It consists of an enhancing solid component (red overlay) and a larger, hypointense part representing a cystic component (blue overlay).Image B (brain; sagittal view) shows a contrast-enhancing tumor (green overlay) between medulla oblongata and cerebellum, within the region of the foramen of Magendie/median aperture.Image C (spine MRI; sagittal view) shows a hyperintense tumor (yellow overlay) within the dorsal/posterior spinal canal at the level of vertebra C5-C6.Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome is a hereditary disorder characterised by the development of tumors in multiple parts of the body. This includes hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, such as in this example. Hemangioblastomas are highly vascular tumours, resulting in the intense enhancement demonstrated on these post contrast images. Peritumoural cysts are common in these tumors, and result from plasma ultrainfiltrate passing through the permeable tumor blood vessels.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "A churning sound in the precordial region (also known as the mill-wheel murmur) is consistent with air in the heart chambers. This finding is characteristic of venous air embolism. Other common features of this condition include sudden hypotension, tachycardia, jugular vein distension, signs of respiratory distress, and, in patients who are being mechanically ventilated, a sudden fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Venous air embolism develops when air enters the venous circulation. This can occur during neurosurgical procedures, especially those that require the patient to be in a sitting position. In this position, the negative (subatmospheric) pressure of the cranial veins due to them being at a higher level than the heart can result in air being sucked into the cranial veins. Other causes of venous air embolism include vascular interventions (e.g., insertion or removal of central venous catheters), penetrating lung injuries, and barotrauma. Management procedures depend on the suspected site of embolism and include compression of the suspected entry site, correction of hypoxia and hypotension, and placing the patient in a head-down position (e.g., Trendelenburg position) or in the left lateral decubitus position (Durant maneuver), both of which help trap the air emboli in the right ventricular apex and therefore prevent further obstruction of the pulmonary outflow tract. If the patient remains unstable following these procedures, direct aspiration of air through a central venous catheter may be considered.",

However, patients with hemorrhagic shock have flat rather than distended jugular veins due to the underlying decrease in central venous pressure.

Although vasopressors can be used in hemodynamically unstable patients with venous air embolism, steroids are not generally recommended.",

Cardiogenic shock due to MI can lead to sudden onset tachycardia, hypotension, jugular vein distension, signs of respiratory distress (hypoxia, crackles on auscultation), and a decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide. However, the presence of the mill-wheel murmur after a neurosurgical procedure of the posterior fossa is inconsistent with cardiogenic shock.",

She received intravenous alteplase therapy and was admitted to the intensive care unit. Twenty-four hours after being admitted, the patient started antiplatelet therapy; she was already able to speak in full sentences and had slightly improved muscle function. While being evaluated by the physical therapist this morning, the patient was confused. Her pulse is 72/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/64 mm Hg. She does not respond to verbal commands but withdraws appropriately to painful stimuli. Neurologic examination shows equal and reactive pupils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a common complication of ischemic stroke and typically manifests with neurologic deterioration (e.g., new confusion, worsening neurological deficits) within 24–48 hours of the inciting ischemic event. The risk of hemorrhagic transformation is significantly increased in patients who have received thrombolytic medications (e.g., alteplase), antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel), and/or thrombosis prophylaxis (e.g., heparin, enoxaparin). Other risk factors for HT include hyperglycemia, hypertension, advanced age, delayed initiation of reperfusion therapy, and large infarct size. Measures that can reduce the rate of HT include neuroprotective measures (e.g., tight blood pressure and glycemic control, targeted temperature management) and careful preselection of patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy.",

On arrival, he is unresponsive. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial hemorrhage. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated and not receiving any paralytic or sedative medications. Temperature is 34.9°C (94.8°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 105/62 mm Hg after intravenous administration of norepinephrine. Neurological examination on admission shows dilated, nonreactive pupils and absent corneal, gag, and cough reflexes. There is no eye movement upon irrigation of the external auditory canal with cold water. A subsequent independent evaluation by another physician is concordant with these findings. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate action at this time?",

Normothermia can be achieved by covering the patient with warming blankets and/or administering warm intravenous fluids. Other causes of impaired brain function, such as poisoning, drug intoxication, electrolyte imbalances, and hypotension as well as conditions that can mimic brain death (e.g., locked-in syndrome) should be ruled out and corrected if possible.
