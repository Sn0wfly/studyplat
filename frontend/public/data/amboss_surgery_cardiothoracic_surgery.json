PDA is usually an acyanotic congenital condition because most blood passes through normal circulation and thus sufficient oxygen saturation is maintained; only a small amount of blood is pumped through the PDA.

        "explanation_why": "Pulmonary vascular congestion seen on chest x-ray is a sign of left heart failure, with subsequent “backing up” of blood into the pulmonary vasculature, leading to enlarged pulmonary vessels. Although pulmonary vascular congestion is classically associated with congestive heart failure in adults (especially elderly patients), some congenital cardiac defects can also cause this finding (e.g., truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return). In TOF, there is a right ventricular outflow obstruction, leading to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature and, consequently, decreased pulmonary vascular markings on chest x-ray.",

The thickened myocardium in the right ventricle produces increased electrical activity, which shifts the axis of cardiac depolarization. TOF also involves an overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis. It is the most common congenital cyanotic heart lesion. In addition to these ECG findings, a chest x-ray showing a boot-shaped heart also supports the diagnosis. Echocardiography is used to confirm TOF.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↑ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↓ SVR, and ↓ CVP is seen in some cases of distributive shock (e.g., early septic shock), not in hypovolemic shock. Distributive shock is sometimes referred to as warm shock because it involves inappropriate peripheral vasodilation (causing ↓ CVP, ↓ SVR, and thus ↓ PCWP) and increased CO, which leads to excessive blood delivery to the limbs, resulting in inappropriately warm limbs in a hypotensive patient. This patient's limbs are cool, which indicates appropriate peripheral vasoconstriction in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure. In addition, this patient has no history of infection that would predispose to septic shock.",

Hemorrhage (e.g., after a gunshot wound) leads to intravascular volume depletion, which decreases venous return to the right atrium (as evidenced by ↓ CVP). Reduced venous return to the right heart results in decreased blood delivery to the left atrium (evident in ↓ PCWP) and consequently low left ventricular end diastolic volume (i.e., decreased preload). Low preload causes decreased CO (because the heart cannot pump blood that is not there). Because low CO leads to hypotension, the peripheral vasculature constricts (↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain blood pressure that is adequate for organ perfusion.\n\nSee “Overview of the types of shock” table.",

In obstructive shock, blood flow from the right heart to the left heart is blocked, which causes blood to “back up” into the right atrium, causing increased CVP. Insufficient blood is delivered to the LA, leading to decreased LA pressure (and thus ↓ PCWP) and little preload for the LV (causing ↓ CO). Low CO results in hypotension, which induces peripheral vascular constriction (and thus ↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure.

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↓ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↓ SVR, and ↓ CVP is seen in some cases of distributive shock (especially neurogenic shock), not in hypovolemic shock. Neurogenic shock typically results from severe CNS trauma (e.g., spinal cord transection) and is associated with other neurologic abnormalities (e.g., paralysis). Neurogenic shock is believed to be caused by loss of autonomic control of cardiovascular parameters due to CNS damage. Heart rate is characteristically low in neurogenic shock (likely due to excessive vagal tone), which leads to decreased CO. SVR is low because of peripheral vasodilation due to loss of sympathetic tone. Peripheral vasodilation causes decreased venous return to the heart, leading to low CVP and consequently low LA pressure (and thus low PCWP). This patient has no history or physical findings to suggest neurologic injury and he is tachycardic on examination.",

        "explanation_why": "IHA is a common finding in patients with moderate and severe AS and develops as a result of high-velocity, turbulent blood flow near the stenotic valve, which causes mechanical destruction of erythrocytes (macroangiopathic hemolytic anemia). Because IHA suggests severe AS, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is typically indicated. This procedure lowers the aortic transvalvular pressure gradient and consequently decreases the degree of RBC fragmentation. Prosthetic heart valves are a risk factor for macroangiopathic hemolytic anemia, but the condition is much less likely to develop with modern prosthetics. AVR is the only treatment that can improve and possibly cure IHA in patients with severe AS.",

However, contrast esophagography with gastrografin (a water-soluble contrast) is preferred over barium swallow because barium causes an inflammatory response in the mediastinum, which can lead to mediastinitis and fibrosis.

While bedside testing is usually preferred over CT scan for unstable patients (e.g., TEE to confirm aortic dissection), there is no bedside imaging available to reliably confirm the diagnosis of esophageal rupture. In this hemodynamically unstable patient (low systolic pressure, high pulse) with inconclusive x-ray findings, a CT scan of the chest should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and aid in procedure planning. In patients who are hemodynamically stable, contrast esophagography with gastrografin is the preferred confirmatory test.",

    "question_text": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe epigastric discomfort and left-sided chest pain radiating to the back that began after waking up. He has also vomited several times since the pain began. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy the previous day for evaluation of epigastric pain. He has ischemic heart disease and underwent a coronary angioplasty 3 years ago. His mother died of pancreatic cancer when she was 60 years old. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, ramipril, and rosuvastatin. He is pale, anxious, and diaphoretic. His temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg in his upper extremities and 108/68 mm Hg in his lower extremities. Pulse oximetry on room air shows oxygen saturation at 98%. An S4 is audible over the precordium, in addition to crepitus over the chest. Abdominal examination shows tenderness to palpation in the epigastric area. Serum studies show an initial Troponin I level of 0.03 ng/mL and 0.02 ng/mL 6 hours later. A 12-lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T changes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, the pain is usually described as a sharp pain that increases with inspiration. Additionally, this patient does not seem to be in significant respiratory distress since his oxygen saturation is within the normal range (98%), all of which favors another diagnosis.",

Another important feature of aortic dissection is asymmetric blood pressures and pulses. Although this patient presents with chest pain radiating to the back, he has very similar blood pressures in his upper and lower extremities.

The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound. Vital signs are within normal limits. An x-ray of the chest shows no fractures; a 10-mm solid pulmonary nodule is present in the central portion of the right upper lung field. No previous x-rays of the patient are available. A CT scan of the chest is performed, which shows that the nodule has irregular, scalloped borders.

Radiological factors that increase the risk for malignancy include large nodule size (≥ 8 mm), location in the upper lung fields, and irregular, spiculated, or scalloped borders. Clinical risk factors for malignancy include age > 40 years, a history of smoking or asbestos exposure, and a positive family or personal history of malignancy. This patient's nodule has an intermediate risk for malignancy. Accordingly, further evaluation is recommended. Positron emission tomography (PET) can determine if the nodule is metabolically active and should be considered for the evaluation of low-risk or intermediate-risk nodules, which are ≥ 8 mm. FDG-avid nodules should undergo biopsy for histopathological examination. FDG-nonavid nodules should be monitored with a follow-up CT scan. Alternatively, patients with intermediate- or high-risk nodules can proceed directly to biopsy.\n\nIf a biopsy specimen is needed to further evaluate centrally located lesions, transbronchial biopsy is recommended. For peripherally located lesions, CT-guided transcutaneous biopsy is preferred.",

In lung tissue, the presence of SCC can represent primary SCC of the lung or metastasis of an extrapulmonary SCC (more common). Therefore, initial diagnosis in biopsy material requires clinical exclusion of a primary extrapulmonary SCC (e.g., pharyngolaryngeal or anogenital).",

Pericardiocentesis is indicated for hemodynamic stabilization and symptom relief before treatment of the underlying condition (e.g., with hemodialysis) can be started. This patient with diabetes has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely as a result of inadequately managed hyperglycemia. CKD leads to elevation of both serum creatinine and BUN, which can result in chronic pericardial effusion due to uremia. The patient's anemia (due to decreased EPO levels) and bilateral crackles indicating pulmonary edema (due to fluid retention) also likely result from CKD.\n\nIn hemodynamically stable patients with pericardial effusion, the underlying cause should be treated first. If an effusion is due to underlying malignancy, a pericardial window is performed to continuously drain the fluid.",

Although tension pneumothorax may also manifest with decreased oxygen saturation and deep sulcus sign, further findings such as contralateral tracheal deviation, distended neck veins, cyanosis, and hemodynamic instability (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension) are commonly seen.",

Chest x-ray of patients with ARDS usually reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates, air bronchogram, atelectasis, and pleural effusions. This patient's x-ray indicates a pneumothorax, most likely due to increased pressures during mechanical ventilation. Increasing the PEEP is contraindicated as it would exacerbate his condition.",

        "explanation_why": "Insertion of a chest tube into the 4^th–5^th intercostal space between the anterior and midaxillary line (safe triangle) is the most appropriate next step for treating pneumothorax in a mechanically ventilated patient. Mechanical ventilation (especially with a high positive end-expiratory pressure) is considered a risk factor for developing pneumothorax. High ventilatory pressure can damage the lung tissue, causing a leak that allows air to enter the pleural cavity. Because the air entering the pleural space comes from the lung rather than the exterior, it is known as a closed pneumothorax. Following completion of the procedure, another chest x-ray to control the position of chest tube placement should be performed. To prevent further lung damage, the ventilatory pressure should be decreased.\n\nPneumothorax is often hard to diagnose in ventilated patients. Since the x-ray is obtained in the supine position, less air collects apically, making the pneumothorax less obvious.",

H. pylori testing is not recommended in the workup of typical GERD (i.e., in patients without dyspepsia in whom neither PUD nor gastritis is suspected). The prevalence of H. pylori infection among patients with GERD is not greater than in the general population. Test results would not help in the decision for or against the treatment of H. pylori infection in this patient group.

Of all medications that are used to treat GERD, PPIs are associated with the greatest reduction in symptoms and relapse rates. In addition to a trial of PPIs for 8 weeks, certain lifestyle modifications (e.g., smoking cessation, weight loss, elevating the head of the bed while sleeping, avoiding late-night meals) should be recommended.",

His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6° F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum.

However, common neurologic symptoms of SLE include headache, seizure, delirium, and stroke, none of which are present in this patient. Additionally, the patient does not have a history of lupus, and no other clinical features of SLE (e.g., cutaneous lesions, polyarthralgia, malar rash) are present.",

While patients with FA often develop heart failure, it is due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Based on the murmur (holodiastolic, best heard at the right sternal border) and the x-ray findings (showing mediastinal widening), this patient's heart failure is most likely due to thoracic aortic aneurysm with resulting aortic regurgitation. FA can manifest with sensory ataxia (and a positive Romberg test) and can lead to optic atrophy (presenting with loss of vision), but it would not explain this patient's fever or pupillary abnormality.

        "explanation_why": "Treponemal tests (TTs), such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) and the treponema pallidum particle agglutination test (TPPA), are used in the diagnosis of syphilis. Diagnosis is confirmed using a serial testing strategy. In the standard testing algorithm, a nontreponemal test (NTT), such as VDRL or plasma reagin test, is performed first. If the result is positive or equivocal, a TT is performed. In the reverse testing algorithm, a TT is performed first, followed by an NTT test. A positive result for both tests strongly supports the diagnosis of syphilis. This patient likely has tertiary syphilis as he shows signs of both neurosyphilis (positive Romberg test suggesting tabes dorsalis, Argyll Robertson pupil) and cardiac syphilis (ascending aortic aneurysm with consequent heart failure). Since the advent of antibiotics, neurosyphilis has become much less common. Patients with HIV (especially untreated) are at greatest risk of the disease. Tertiary syphilis usually occurs decades after infection with Treponema pallidum, but immunocompromised patients (e.g., due to HIV) may develop symptoms more rapidly. First-line treatment for neurosyphilis is IV penicillin G for 10–14 days.",

    "question_text": "A 74-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of increasing weakness and chills. She also notes difficulty breathing for the last 3 days. Eight weeks ago, she underwent a left hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoma of the colon. She subsequently developed a severe urinary tract infection, was treated in the intensive care unit for 4 days, and was discharged from the hospital 3 weeks ago. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis with lumbar pain, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years. She does not drink alcohol and has never used illicit drugs. Current medications include warfarin, metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. She appears lethargic and has a large conjunctival hemorrhage in her left eye. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 126/79 mm Hg. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new holosystolic murmur over the apex. Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the upper quadrants and a well-healed 12-cm paramedian scar. There are multiple tender nodules on the palmar surface of her fingertips. Fundoscopic examination shows retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's condition?",

        "explanation_why": "The patient underwent a porcine valve replacement for severe mitral valve regurgitation 12 years ago. Biological valves (both bovine and porcine) typically have a short lifespan due to sclerotic degeneration. If the prosthetic valve becomes dysfunctional, the patient may have to undergo open-heart surgery for valve replacement again. Possible complications of the biological prosthetic valve include obstruction/stenosis, as seen in this patient, and regurgitation, both of which may manifest with signs of CHF.\n\nBiological prosthetic valves are preferred over mechanical prosthetic valves in patients > 65 years of age because the degeneration process is slower than in younger patients and they typically do not need further surgery to replace the valve again. In addition, anticoagulation is only needed for 3 months following the surgery. Thus, biologic prosthetic valves are also preferred in patients with a high risk of bleeding, and in women with a desire to have children, since certain anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) are teratogenic.",

He feels well but reports occasional episodes of slurred speech and weakness during the past 6 months. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 142/96 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. ECG shows a regular sinus rhythm, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and no acute abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 142/96 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. ECG shows a regular sinus rhythm, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and no acute abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "correct_answer": "A",

    "hint": "This patient's occasional episodes of weakness and slurred speech are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). This history, in combination with his peripheral vascular disease, multiple risk factors (smoking, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia), and carotid bruit indicate symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) due to atherosclerosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Duplex ultrasonography of the neck is typically the first-line imaging modality for patients with symptomatic CAS (e.g., TIA, amaurosis fugax, ischemic stroke). Some guidelines also recommend ultrasonography of the neck to screen for CAS in asymptomatic patients with a carotid bruit and multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In patients with CAS, ultrasonography shows a focally-increased velocity of blood flow. Duplex ultrasonography is an inexpensive, noninvasive test with high specificity and sensitivity for the detection of CAS. It can also quantify the degree of stenosis.\n\nAntiplatelet therapy, statin therapy, blood pressure control, and lifestyle changes (e.g., smoking cessation, weight control, regular exercise) are the mainstays of treatment in CAS. Carotid revascularization (typically with carotid endarterectomy) is indicated for patients with symptomatic disease and severe stenosis (≥ 70%).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In cardiac tamponade, outward expansion of the ventricles is limited because of fluid in the pericardial space. During inspiration, increased venous return leads to increased right ventricular volume. As outward expansion is limited, the right ventricle expands via the interventricular septum, which bulges into the left ventricle. This effect leads to further reduction in left ventricular filling during inspiration, resulting in decreased stroke volume and a subsequent drop in blood pressure. A drop in systolic blood pressure > 10 mm Hg during inspiration is known as pulsus paradoxus, a sign characteristically seen in moderate and severe cardiac tamponade but also in some cases of severe asthma, tension pneumothorax, and constrictive pericarditis.",

Additionally, paradoxical breathing (the flail segment moves opposite to the chest wall as the patient breaths) would be present. Although this patient may have rib fractures due to the high-speed trauma, the examination is inconsistent with a flail chest.",

        "explanation_why": "Diaphragmatic rupture is most commonly caused by penetrating injuries, followed by blunt trauma, both of which can be caused by a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Clinical features include chest/abdominal wall bruises, decreased breath sounds due to herniation of abdominal contents into the chest, and respiratory distress. Chest auscultation may reveal bowel sounds. Chest x-ray may show disturbed contour of the hemidiaphragm, displaced abdominal organs, and mediastinal shift, as well as an hourglass sign if abdominal contents are constricted at the defect. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nDiaphragmatic ruptures more commonly occur on the left side because the right diaphragm is protected by the liver. Patients may initially be asymptomatic, so this condition is often not diagnosed immediately.",

        "explanation_why": "A barium swallow may be used to confirm suspected diaphragmatic rupture by showing abdominal contents above the diaphragm. However, a barium swallow test is not routinely used in the diagnosis of traumatic diaphragmatic rupture, as the procedure is lengthier and less precise than other procedures and requires the patient's cooperation. Moreover, traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are often associated with other injuries such as esophageal tears. If barium, a water-insoluble contrast media, enters the mediastinum through a perforation, it may lead to mediastinitis and subsequent fibrosis. A barium study should therefore only be performed after perforations of the gastrointestinal tract have been ruled out.",

X-ray findings alone are not sufficient to establish diaphragmatic rupture as the definitive diagnosis, as x-rays only show indirect signs of the injury. Moreover, concomitant injuries should be ruled out. A CT would be able to directly visualize the discontinuity of the affected hemidiaphragm and confirm the diagnosis.

On arrival, he has severe left-sided chest pain. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 32 years. Current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, and a multivitamin. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 17/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 132/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Examination shows multiple abrasions on his left flank and trunk. The left lateral chest wall is tender to palpation and bony crepitus is present. The remainder of the examination, including cardiopulmonary and abdominal examination, shows no abnormalities. Extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (eFAST) is negative. An x-ray of the chest shows nondisplaced fractures of the left 4^th and 5^th ribs and clear lung fields bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Conservative fracture management is recommended for patients who have < 3 rib fractures and no evidence of fracture displacement, complications of rib fractures, or other traumatic fractures. In patients with a rib fracture, the pain accompanying chest wall expansion can cause reflex hypoventilation and cough reflex suppression. Adequate pain control is important in preventing hypoventilation and its sequelae (e.g., atelectasis). NSAIDs are most commonly used in these patients, and can also be combined with opioids or intercostal nerve blocks if necessary.\n\nHospital admission is generally warranted in patients with ≥ 3 rib fractures, displaced rib fractures, signs of flail chest, or other complications of rib fractures (e.g., severe pulmonary contusions, renal laceration, splenic laceration). Rib fractures that cause pneumothorax or hemothorax may warrant tube thoracostomy. For falls in older individuals, a workup to identify risk factors for falls would be required.",

In the case of TBI due to blunt trauma, injury usually occurs within 2 cm of the carina or at the origin of lobar bronchi. In such a scenario, TBI would manifest with acute dyspnea, as well as clinical features of subcutaneous emphysema (e.g., palpable crepitus), pneumomediastinum (e.g., Hamman crunch), and/or pneumothorax (e.g., decreased breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion note). The absence of characteristic clinical and radiological findings, as well as the delayed onset of dyspnea in this patient, makes the diagnosis of TBI unlikely.",

A chest tube (yellow overlay) is in place, with its tip in the apex of the right hemithorax.Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax can result from blunt or penetrating thoracic injury and various other conditions (e.g., lung disease, intestinal perforation, medical procedure). Air that escapes from the lungs, airways, or bowel can track into the mediastinal and subcutaneous soft tissues.",

Tension pneumothorax may develop if a rib fracture causes a pulmonary laceration that fails to seal and can manifest with chest pain, dyspnea, decreased breath sounds, and contralateral deviation of the trachea. However, a patient with pneumothorax would have hyperresonant lung fields on percussion instead of dullness on the affected site. Also, a chest x-ray would show increased radiolucency and decreased lung markings rather than increased opacity.",

Tracheal deviation and increased lung opacity are not associated with isolated cardiac tamponade. Instead, a chest x-ray is likely to reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette.",

        "explanation_why": "Chest tube insertion into the 4^th to 5^th intercostal space at the midaxillary line is the treatment of choice for all patients with moderate to large hemothoraces. Alternatively, the chest tube can be inserted into lower intercostal spaces with ultrasound guidance. The chest tube should be placed posteriorly for optimal fluid drainage. A hemothorax must be drained in most cases because blood in the pleural cavity will clot if not evacuated, resulting in a trapped lung (impaired lung expansion due to the clot) or an empyema (due to clot infection). Conservative management may be considered to treat small hemothoraces in consultation with a specialist but has a significant failure rate.\n\nThoracotomy is indicated if chest tube output is > 1500 mL directly after placement, 200 mL/hour for 2–4 hours, or if multiple transfusions are required.",

In view of the trauma history, the likely causes are pulmonary contusion and hemothorax. The slightly high position of the gastric bubble (GB) also suggests the presence of left lower lobe atelectasis. The right lung and cardiac silhouette are normal.Circle: fracture of the anterior left seventh rib",

He has a history of chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and severe osteoarthritis in both knees. He is unable to climb the stairs because of knee pain and only walks indoors around his house. He has severe abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis but does not report any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes and consumed 4–6 beers daily for 25 years but quit smoking and alcohol consumption 5 years ago. Current medications include insulin, metoprolol, lisinopril, rosuvastatin, ibuprofen, and pregabalin. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination and a 12-lead ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for assessing this patient's perioperative cardiac risk?",

        "explanation_why": "The goal of preoperative cardiac stress testing (CST) is to identify patients who might require cardiac revascularization before nonemergent surgeries. Preoperative CST should be considered for a patient who has a high major adverse cardiac event risk and poor or unknown functional capacity. CST is performed using ECG or cardiac imaging (e.g., stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging). An exercise stress test can be performed if the patient is able to achieve ≥ 5 metabolic equivalents using the chosen exercise modality. For patients who are unable to do so, pharmacological stress testing (i.e., with adenosine, dipyridamole, regadenoson, or dobutamine) is the most appropriate option. If a stress test is abnormal, preoperative revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) can be considered to decrease the risk of major adverse cardiac events.",

However, pulse pressure is an indicator of stroke volume and not a direct indicator of end-organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation aims to achieve adequate end-organ perfusion, so a change in pulse pressure is not the best indicator to evaluate fluid resuscitation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion and to restore intravascular volume. Since renal blood flow (and therefore GFR) is highly sensitive to changes in blood pressure and intravascular volume, urine output can serve as a surrogate measure to determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate. Ideally, urine output in adults should be greater than 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Therefore, a 70-kg man should have a urine output of 35–70 mL/hr. A urine output of 25mL in 3 hours suggests that his kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow and therefore that he has not received adequate fluid resuscitation.\n\nWith adequate fluid resuscitation, an increase in some of the other indices, such as pulse pressure and Glasgow coma scale, might occur before a change in urine output is apparent. However, these parameters are not specific indicators of end-organ perfusion. Other parameters, such as lactate and a base deficit, are more useful for determining the prognosis than for guiding fluid therapy.",

However, serum lactate levels are not used to determine whether fluid resuscitation is inadequate because, even after adequate fluid resuscitation and correction of tissue hypoperfusion, lactate levels may not reach normal levels (< 2 mEq/L) for a few hours. Lactate clearance may take even longer in critically ill patients as a result of a prolonged lactate half-life (due to hepatic and/or renal dysfunction) and/or increased glycolysis.

It typically manifests as a high-frequency, midsystolic click combined with a high-frequency, mid-to-late systolic murmur heard best at the apex, which is consistent with this patient's auscultatory findings. Mitral valve prolapse is most often idiopathic, but can also be secondary to conditions such as rheumatic heart disease, infectious endocarditis, connective tissue disorders, or myocardial infarction (MI). Following MI, ischemia of the papillary muscles and subsequent rupture of the chordae tendinae may cause one or both mitral valve leaflets to prolapse into the left atrium, which leads to acute symptoms of regurgitation. Even though this patient has a history of MI, his asymptomatic presentation 3 years later suggests an idiopathic etiology.\n\nSee “Auscultation in valvular defects” table.",

The great arteries arise from the true lumen (green). The celiac trunk (CT), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and right renal artery (ARD) also arise from the true lumen. The left renal artery (ARS) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) arise from the false lumen. The malrotated kidneys (K) show perfusion irregularities.Additional findings include bilateral basal atelectasis (blue overlay), pleural effusions (yellow overlay), right renal cyst, colonic and gallbladder contrast (from a previous CT), foley catheter, and postoperative changes with left periiliac and anterior abdominal wall hematomas. A right internal jugular catheter (red overlay) is well-positioned and terminates in the superior vena cava. The left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) is occluded and a left internal jugular catheter (red overlay) terminates in a small vein anterior to the aortic arch.",

EGD should be considered if this patient's symptoms of burning epigastric pain were due to worsening gastritis – however, mediastinal emphysema is highly suggestive of esophageal perforation. If esophageal perforation is suspected during upper endoscopy (not on the next day, as in this patient), careful endoscopic inspection without insufflation is warranted to localize the esophageal defect.",

        "explanation_why": "Iatrogenic trauma is the most common etiology of esophageal perforation (e.g., following upper endoscopy). While this patient's x-ray findings and Hamman sign already suggest pneumomediastinum, gastrografin contrast esophagography is indicated as a confirmatory test to visualize the potential defect and assess its size and exact location. Gastrografin is preferred over barium as a contrast agent because it is water-soluble and less irritating; extravasation of barium may cause mediastinitis and subsequent fibrosis. There is no free air under the diaphragms on CXR, thus gastric perforation is unlikely.\n\nIf Boerhaave syndrome is suspected, a chest x-ray is conducted first, which may show lucency from mediastinal and/or subcutaneous air. While gastrografin contrast esophagography is usually the preferred confirmatory test, there may be false negatives in up to 20% of cases. The ease of a CT scan has made CT a popular alternative in hemodynamically unstable patients and/or if x-ray and contrast esophagogram are inconclusive. In a patient with esophageal perforation, the CT may demonstrate intramural swelling/hematoma and periesophageal air collections tracking into the surrounding tissues.",

A small residual right pneumothorax (arrowheads) is visible and pneumomediastinum is seen along the trachea, main bronchi, and cardiac silhouette (red overlay and arrows). A chest tube (yellow overlay) is in place, with its tip in the apex of the right hemithorax.Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax can result from blunt or penetrating thoracic injury and various other conditions (e.g., lung disease, intestinal perforation, medical procedure). Air that escapes from the lungs, airways, or bowel can track into the mediastinal and subcutaneous soft tissues.",

This patient exhibits all the signs and symptoms of a massive hemothorax, i.e., tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, flat neck veins, decreased breath sounds, and dullness on percussion on the affected side, as well as tracheal deviation to the opposite side. A hemothorax must be drained in most cases because blood in the pleural cavity may clot if not evacuated, resulting in a trapped lung (impaired lung expansion due to the clot) or an empyema (due to clot infection). Treatment usually consists of chest tube insertion into the 4^th–5^th intercostal space at the midaxillary line in order to allow the blood to drain away and improve lung ventilation. Conservative management may be considered to treat small hemothoraces in consultation with a specialist but has a significant failure rate.",

Additionally, the cardiac silhouette is shifted slightly to the right (indicated by blue line and arrow) and the left bronchial tree is slightly elevated (indicated by black lines and arrow).In the right hemithorax, a small meniscus from effusion is seen laterally (indicated by red line).

This floating rib cage segment is decoupled from the chest wall and causes paradoxical chest movement. Upon inspiration, as the intrathoracic pressure drops, the unstable segment will be pulled inwards by the negative pressure, and during expiration, the floating segment moves outward. This condition usually results from high-energy blunt trauma to the chest (e.g., motor vehicle collision). Patients with flail chest commonly present with features of respiratory distress (e.g., dyspnea, tachypnea), which can be due to hypoventilation (as a result of pain), pulmonary contusions, pneumothorax, and/or hemothorax.",

He initially thought the pain would resolve with rest but it became more severe over the last 2 hours. Last year while rock climbing he fell onto his right shoulder and “needed a sling to fix it.” He has psoriasis. His only medication is topical clobetasol. His pulse is 95/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 114/70 mm Hg. Examination shows full passive and active range of motion of the left shoulder. There is no tenderness to palpation at the acromioclavicular joint. There are silvery plaques over both knees and elbows. Abdominal examination shows severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant with voluntary guarding. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes are within the reference range. Chest x-ray is normal. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma shows no evidence of free intraperitoneal fluid. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "The severity of abdominal injury determines whether hemodynamically stable patients can be managed nonoperatively with serial monitoring of vital signs. Although unsupported by high-quality evidence, serial monitoring of vital signs for a period of 9 hours without imaging may be a reasonable approach following trauma for hemodynamically stable patients with a low risk of abdominal injury. This patient, however, has fallen from a height of 10 feet and has left upper quadrant pain and guarding, as well as a positive Kehr sign, all of which indicate a splenic injury that requires additional abdominal imaging.",

CT scan has greater specificity than ultrasonography for diagnosing splenic lacerations because it can visualize the vasculature and parenchyma of the spleen in high resolution. Findings on the CT scan are used to grade splenic injury and guide further management. CT scan can also rule out other concomitant injuries in cases of abdominal trauma, especially injuries involving retroperitoneal structures.",

Intrasplenic low-attenuation rounded and linear areas are sites of laceration and hematoma formation. Multiple small high-density foci along the inferior aspect of the spleen indicate contrast extravasation (arrows) from active bleeding.Hemorrhage (green overlay) into the peritoneal space extends from the spleen inferiorly along the paracolic gutter. Hemorrhagic fluid is also seen along the liver (yellow overlay) and within the right paracolic gutter and pelvis (yellow overlay).Multiple thoracic spine fractures (examples indicated by arrowheads) are accompanied by paravertebral hematoma (red overlay).",

DPL should only be considered in hemodynamically unstable patients who have an inconclusive FAST scan. However, this patient is hemodynamically stable and a FAST scan was negative for free intraperitoneal fluid. In addition, although highly sensitive, DPL has largely fallen out of favor because it is an invasive procedure; it may, however, be necessary in some cases (e.g., in resource-poor settings).",

However, the combination of left upper quadrant tenderness and guarding, onset of left shoulder pain a few hours after the initial trauma, and a normal shoulder joint examination indicates that this patient's acute shoulder pain is most likely the result of referred pain due to diaphragmatic irritation (Kehr sign) rather than a traumatic shoulder injury.",

The patient suddenly collapsed on his way to the bathroom after waking up in the morning. He did not sustain any injuries from his collapse. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gout. The patient's mother died of a grand mal seizure at the age of 53 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 55 years. He drinks three beers and two glasses of whiskey daily. Current medications include ranitidine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and allopurinol. He is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); 23 kg/m^2. He appears pale. Temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg supine and 100/70 mm Hg one minute after standing with no change in pulse rate. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor. A plopping sound is heard on auscultation, immediately followed by a low-pitched, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a regular sinus rhythm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient presents with syncope, orthostatic hypotension (a drop of ≥ 20 mm Hg in systolic pressure from supine to standing), and a diastolic murmur over the apex, all of which suggest an obstruction of the blood flow into the left ventricle.",

        "explanation_why": "Cardiac myxomas are most commonly located in the left atrium. They may be pedunculated, in which case they often present with position-dependent symptoms of obstructed blood flow through the atrioventricular valves, or they may embolize systemically. Additionally, patients may present with constitutional findings (e.g., weight loss, fever, or anemia). The typical auscultatory finding (also present in this patient) is an early diastolic “plop”, caused by a movement of the mobile tumor mass, followed by a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apex that results from the obstructed blood flow through the mitral valve, and mimics the murmur of mitral stenosis. Echocardiography is the diagnostic test of choice to visualize the tumor and to assess its location, size, attachment, and mobility. The only definitive treatment of cardiac myxoma is surgical resection.",

This patient is taking an alpha-1 blocker and presents with orthostatic hypotension. However, among the alpha-1 blockers, tamsulosin is the agent with the lowest potential of inducing hypotension because of its increased selectivity for alpha-1 receptors of the bladder neck and the prostatic urethra.

CECT angiography has high sensitivity and specificity, can screen for additional vascular injuries (e.g., abdominal aortic injury), and provides anatomical information for planning surgical management.

He was delivered by cesarean delivery at 37 weeks' gestation to a 38-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus that was well-controlled during the pregnancy. She has not received any immunizations since her childhood. The newborn's temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 170/min, respirations are 55/min, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 85%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a 2/6 holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. Echocardiography shows pulmonary arteries arising from the posterior left ventricle, and the aorta rising anteriorly from the right ventricle.

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Echocardiography findings are consistent with the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA): In TGA, the systemic circulation is disconnected from pulmonary circulation and venous blood that is received by the right ventricle is pumped to the rest of the body without being oxygenated.

        "explanation_why": "TGA results in rapidly worsening hypoxemia and cyanosis shortly after birth, and relies on a patent ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is kept patent in fetal circulation by the effect of low partial pressure of oxygen in fetal circulation, as well as by endogenously produced prostaglandin E. After birth, the ductus arteriosus begins to close in response to an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen. Intravenously administered prostaglandin E1 keeps the ductus arteriosus open and allows mixing of blood between the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This effect is crucial for initial survival of infants with TGA because it is the only way to maintain oxygenation of the arterial blood until surgical repair can be performed.",

During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 mL of turbid fluid.

Malignant effusion is caused by cancer-related barrier dysfunction of the capillary walls, which leads to increased permeation of plasma protein, blood cells, and tumor cells. These effusions are usually exudative and cell-rich, with a cloudy or straw-like appearance, abnormal cytology, a glucose concentration < 60 mg/dL, pH < 7.2, and high concentrations of LDH (> 0.45 x normal serum LDH) and amylase (> 200 mg/dL).\n\nIn addition to addressing the underlying malignancy, symptomatic malignant pleural effusions can be treated with therapeutic thoracocentesis and, if the effusion is expected to reaccumulate rapidly or frequently, an indwelling pleural catheter or chemical pleurodesis.",

    "question_text": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was the restrained driver. On questioning by the paramedics, he reported severe chest pain and mild dyspnea. On arrival, he is confused and unable to provide a history.

Successful placement of a needle thoracostomy allows the air to leave the thoracic cavity and results in immediate decompression of thoracic organs and resolution of hemodynamic compromise.\n\nNeedle thoracostomy is a temporizing measure and should always be followed by chest tube insertion in order to resolve the simple pneumothorax that results from needle insertion.

Progressive accumulation of air within the pleural space causes an ipsilateral increase in intrapleural pressure, leading to ipsilateral lung collapse and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side. The mediastinal shift compresses the vena cavae, trachea, and the contralateral lung, leading to hemodynamic instability and hypoxia.",

On arrival, he is unconscious. His pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large-bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) results are negative. An ECG shows absent P waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?",

Instead, his profound hypotension despite an apparently normal volume status, the bibasilar lung crackles, and elevated jugular venous pressure potentially indicate cardiogenic shock.",

        "explanation_why": "In the context of a serious motor vehicle collision, this patient's hypotension and tachycardia refractive to fluid resuscitation, including vasopressors, combined with atrial fibrillation on ECG and a negative FAST, are highly suspicious for cardiac contusion. Cardiac contusions may manifest with clinical features ranging from asymptomatic arrhythmias to rapidly fatal cardiac rupture. Blunt chest trauma and/or sudden deceleration can lead to decreased contractility and arrhythmias due to injury to cardiac myocytes and pacemaker cells. Decreased contractility directly contributes to cardiogenic shock with decreased cardiac output and hypotension, as in this patient.",

It may also be associated with a raised jugular venous pressure. In severe cases of hemothorax, blood loss into the thoracic cavity can lead to hemorrhagic shock, with subsequent tachycardia and hypotension. However, a hemothorax is distinctly identifiable on chest x-ray or on ultrasound as part of the FAST exam. No signs of internal bleeding are apparent on this patient's FAST exam and the physical exam findings (bibasilar crackles, soft abdomen) make a significant hemothorax even more unlikely.",

Aortic dissection is associated with hypotension either if the dissection involves the ascending aorta resulting in cardiac tamponade and/or aortic regurgitation, or if it results in aortic rupture and hemorrhage into the mediastinum. On the FAST exam, however, aortic rupture would be apparent as free fluid above the diaphragm, with secondary cardiac tamponade as fluid accumulates in the pericardium. Moreover, secondary aortic regurgitation severe enough to affect the patient's vitals would be heard on auscultation.",

Symptoms may then worsen following fluid administration as fluid accumulates in the damaged lung.

Thymectomy can improve muscle weakness and even cure myasthenia gravis.\n\nPatients with thymoma may be asymptomatic or present with thoracic symptoms (e.g., chest pain, cough, dyspnea, superior vena cava syndrome) or paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., myasthenia gravis).",

Initially, the vomit was yellowish in color, but after the first couple of episodes it was streaked with blood. He had 2 episodes of vomiting that contained streaks of frank blood on the way to the hospital. He has been hospitalized twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. He drinks 2 pints of vodka daily but had over 4 pints during the past 12 hours. He takes naproxen for his “hangovers.” He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37°C (99.1°F), pulse is 105/min, and blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes and a tremor of his hands. The abdomen is soft and shows tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region; there is no organomegaly. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.3 g/dL and hematocrit concentration is 40%. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",

    "hint": "The presence of dyspnea and tachypnea with decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion after a penetrating chest wound with bubbling of blood indicates an open pneumothorax.

        "explanation_why": "A partially occlusive dressing (such as clear plastic film taped at 3 out of 4 sides of the lesion) is a temporary treatment for open pneumothorax, used to prevent further expansion of the pneumothorax until the diagnosis has been confirmed and definitive treatment is available. This dressing creates a flutter valve effect (i.e., air is free to escape from the gap in the dressing during exhalation while the dressing occludes the wound during inhalation), preventing the entry of further air via the wound into the thoracic cavity. Once the patient has been fully stabilized, a chest tube would be placed for definitive treatment of his pneumothorax. The tube should be placed through intact skin in one of the recommended anatomical locations, not through the preexisting injury.\n\nChest tubes alone are sufficient treatment for pneumothorax in ∼ 85% of cases; surgery is required for the remainder.",

Therefore, emergency pericardiocentesis is not indicated at this time.",

The ATLS-recommended approach to trauma resuscitation follows the ABCDE algorithm; Airway → Breathing → Circulation → Disability → Exposure → adjunctive tests (e.g., FAST exam). This patient has airway/breathing injuries that require treatment before resuscitation can continue to the adjunctive treatments. Although echocardiography would likely be performed on this patient at a later point, this test is not readily available in a combat field and this patient has another injury that takes precedence in trauma resuscitation.",

Although this patient is at risk for tension pneumothorax given his penetrating chest wound, he is currently hemodynamically stable. Additionally, tension pneumothorax is caused by a chest wound acting as a one-way valve, allowing air into the pleural space but not allowing it to escape, which builds up pressure. Blood is seen bubbling from this patient's wound, which means that air is escaping from the wound.",

Her pulse is 140/min, respirations are 12/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography shows blood in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.6 g/dL and hematocrit is 22%. The surgeon decides to move the patient to the operating room for an emergency explorative laparotomy. Packed red blood cell transfusion is ordered prior to surgery. A friend of the patient asks for the transfusion to be held as the patient is a Jehovah's Witness. The patient has no advance directive and there is no documentation showing her refusal of blood transfusions. The patient's husband and children cannot be contacted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In some states, a “close friend” may be considered as a surrogate. Physicians must make their decisions with consideration for the patient's preferences. However, as this patient's preferences are not clearly documented, it would be inappropriate to withhold lifesaving treatment based on the unverifiable claims of a friend.

The patient was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa 9 months ago. Her only medication is citalopram. She appears pale. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (136.6 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. The remainder of the physical examination shows swelling of the salivary glands, dry skin, and brittle nails. An ECG and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Contrast esophagram with gastrografin shows mild leakage of contrast from the lower esophagus into the mediastinum without contrast extravasation into the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Phyllodes tumors are rare (< 1% of all breast tumors) and typically manifest with a painless breast lump, which can make it difficult to differentiate this tumor from more common benign breast tumors (e.g., fibroadenoma). Phyllodes tumors may even appear similar to fibroadenoma on imaging. A core needle biopsy is required to definitively diagnose phyllodes tumor and to rule out malignancy. (See “Overview of benign neoplasms of the breast” table.)\n\nAlthough most phyllodes tumors are benign, ∼ 25% of cases are malignant. Surgical excision with wide margins is required. Surgery for patients with benign phyllodes tumors is usually curative, although local recurrence can occur, which often warrants total mastectomy.",

        "explanation_why": "Invasive lobular carcinoma accounts for 10–15% of breast cancers and may manifest as a painless breast nodule. Although malignancy should always be considered in breast masses, especially in middle-aged women, invasive lobular carcinoma is associated with skin changes (retraction, dimpling, edema), nipple retraction, bloody nipple discharge, and/or lymphadenopathy. Moreover, mammogram typically shows microcalcifications and spicules, and biopsy shows malignant cells in lobules and monomorphic cells in single rows.",

            "description": "Photomicrograph of a breast tumor tissue specimen (H&E stain; 40x magnification)Infiltrating malignant cells can be seen as single cells, narrow chords (examples indicated by green overlay), and characteristic single-file formations (examples indicated by blue overlay). The tumor cells are seen growing between distorted ductuli (D) and lobuli (L), surrounded by conspicuously pale connective tissue. There is no tubule formation of the tumor (as is commonly seen in other types of adenocarcinomas of the breast).This is the typical appearance of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast.Click on the microscope icon (at the top) to view the entire specimen through a virtual microscope.",

However, this patient is currently showing signs of PE, and given the potentially life-threatening nature of missed PEs, the next best step would be to confirm the diagnosis through another test. Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities should be considered to confirm the presence of a DVT after stabilization and treatment of this patient's PE.\n\nCompression ultrasonography is generally not a recommended initial diagnostic test when evaluating patients with suspected PE. However, in select patients, especially those with features of DVT in which the diagnostic tests of choice are inconclusive or contraindicated, compression ultrasonography of the legs may be sufficient to diagnose PE. If compression ultrasonography confirms DVT, anticoagulation may be initiated without confirming PE.",

            "description": "Various POCUS (point of care ultrasound) protocols exist for the detection of lower extremity DVT (deep vein thrombosis). In contrast to the whole-leg scans performed by radiology departments, POCUS protocols typically use only 2 or 3 points of compression along the femoral and popliteal veins.– Preferred probe: linear– Patient positioning: supine; leg rotated laterally at the hip and knee bent ∼ 30º– Compression technique: Holding the probe perpendicular to the skin, apply enough downward pressure to slightly compress the pulsatile artery.– Interpretation: The pressure needed to slightly compress the artery should completely collapse a non-thrombosed vein. A non-collapsible vein is highly suggestive of a DVT. Direct visualization of an intraluminal hyperechoic mass (asterisk) confirms the diagnosis.Three-point protocol steps:1. Locate the CFV and CFA at the branch point of the GSV from the CFV. Compress.2. Move the transducer distally along the CFV, just past the branch point of the FV and DFV, where the FA is superficial to the FV. Compress.3. Reposition the probe behind the knee and locate the PV superficial to the PA. Compress.CFA: common femoral artery; CFV: common femoral vein; DFV: deep femoral vein; GSV: great saphenous vein; FA: femoral artery; FV: femoral vein; PA: popliteal artery; PV: popliteal vein",

She is a research assistant at the university's geology laboratory. She was born in Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Examination shows ciliary injection and photophobia of the left eye. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's x-ray findings in conjunction with shortness of breath, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms (e.g., malaise) strongly suggest sarcoidosis. This condition most commonly affects the lungs; however, sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder that can manifest in many other organs. Extrapulmonary manifestations include anterior uveitis (suggested by this patient's photophobia and ciliary injections), which occurs in approx. 25% of patients. The triad of symmetric arthritis (which is often migratory), erythema nodosum, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is referred to as Lofgren syndrome, which is a form of acute sarcoidosis. Acute sarcoidosis is usually self-limited, resolving within approx. 2 years, and rarely progresses to chronic sarcoidosis.\n\nIncidence is highest among women and Black individuals.",

Pulmonary TB also manifests with dyspnea, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and cough, but the cough would normally be productive in TB. Hilar lymphadenopathy is a common feature seen on x-ray in TB, but reticular opacities would not be expected. TB would rather cause a calcified granuloma (Ghon complex). Lastly, even though TB can affect the skeleton (primarily the spine), ankle arthralgia is extremely uncommon in TB.",

            "description": "Active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) typically manifests with systemic (e.g., low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss, decreased appetite, and malaise) and pulmonary symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain due to pleural effusion, productive cough, and possibly hemoptysis in advanced stages).\nSymptomatic TB can occur as a result of primary infection (primary active TB) or reactivation of latent infection (reactivation TB). While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes. Chest x-ray in reactivation TB typically shows multiple cavities in the upper lobes, calcifications, patchy consolidations, and features fibroproliferative disease (e.g, scarring) due to inflammatory tissue destruction.",

A small amount of honeycombing (example indicated by red overlay) is seen. There is a heterogeneous pattern of lung attenuation (mosaic attenuation), with areas of low attenuation (examples indicated by green overlays) in some regions with no fibrosis; expiratory phase imaging could help assess whether or not such areas represent air trapping.Fibrotic HP has a variable appearance on CT. A pattern typical of fibrotic HP shows a random axial distribution of coarse reticulation and small airway disease with minimal honeycombing and no zonal predominance. Subpleural fibrosis can be compatible with HP, as can upper zonal, lower zonal, or central predominant distributions.",

The underlying pathophysiology is often complex but contributing factors may include high levels of catecholamines (endogenously due to the perioperative stress state; exogenous in the case of cardiovascular support), electrolyte or acid-base imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), reduced ventilation (leading to hypoxia and/or hypercarbia), and certain drugs. This patient takes a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), which is associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia. In cardiac cells, hypokalemia inhibits cardiac Na-K ATPase and causes prolonged ventricular repolarization, which predisposes to arrhythmias.\n\nMost patients with PVCs are asymptomatic and treatment (e.g., with antiarrhythmics or catheter ablation) is only required if PVCs are frequent or significantly symptomatic.",

    "question_text": "A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. The patient appears to be in moderate respiratory distress and is cradling his upper left arm in his right arm. He is oriented to person but not to place or time.

The flail segment further increases the work of breathing and restricts lung volume changes by moving in the direction opposite to thoracic wall movement. The initial management of a flail chest consists of adequate analgesia and supplemental oxygen therapy. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is indicated if the patient has evidence of respiratory failure. PPV directly assists with alveolar ventilation and gas exchange and may have an internal splinting effect on the flail segment. In patients who are alert and fully oriented, noninvasive PPV may be attempted, but this patient with an altered mental status also requires intubation for airway protection.\n\nIf the patient with a flail chest has a concomitant pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy should be performed before initiating PPV to prevent a simple pneumothorax from turning into a life-threatening tension pneumothorax.",

Bag-mask ventilation is contraindicated as air is pumped into the stomach and the bowel, resulting in gastric and/or intestinal distention and further compression of the lung. As in this patient, the majority (approximately 85%) of CDH cases are left-sided.\n\nFollowing intubation, a nasogastric tube should be placed for gastric decompression to decompress the stomach/bowel and reduce lung compression.",

She recovered immediately and was not confused following the episodes. During the past 5 months, she has also had increased shortness of breath and palpitations. She has been unable to carry out her daily activities. She also reports some chest tightness that resolves with rest. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She immigrated with her family from India 10 years ago. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 115/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows accentuation and splitting of S_2. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur in the fifth left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right axis deviation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of these findings?",

    "correct_answer": "F",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient has features of mitral stenosis (opening snap and diastolic murmur along with atrial fibrillation) that has progressed and caused further hemodynamic changes. Mitral stenosis commonly occurs as a late complication of rheumatic fever, which is more common in developing countries where patients may not have been adequately treated.",
    "learning_objective": "Recognize mitral stenosis, and recall its hemodynamic consequences.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is seen in left heart failure, but this patient demonstrates signs of mitral stenosis (MS). MS causes a decrease in LVEDP due to impaired ability to fill the left ventricle in diastole through the stenotic valve.",

However, this patient's cardiovascular examination is consistent with mitral stenosis (opening snap with low-pitched diastolic murmur at the apex). She does not have a murmur that suggests a VSD or ASD (holosystolic murmur).",

        "explanation_why": "Decreased left ventricular contractility may be due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. A decrease in contractility may lead to left heart failure, increased left heart pressures, and subsequent right heart failure. However, the patient shows signs of mitral stenosis (MS), left atrial dilatation, and right ventricular hypertrophy, suggesting that MS is the underlying mechanism and not left ventricular failure.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased systemic arterial resistance can be seen in patients with essential hypertension or secondary causes of hypertension. This may eventually lead to left ventricular hypertrophy which can evolve into diastolic dysfunction. As this patient shows right axis deviation on ECG, she is unlikely to have left ventricular hypertrophy. Additionally, the patient has normal blood pressure on examination, which suggests a different diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Preload to the right ventricle is determined by central venous pressure and venous return to the heart and may be increased in states that expand blood volume (such as congestive heart failure). While this patient shows signs of right-sided heart failure, the presence of mitral stenosis with right axis deviation suggests a different underlying mechanism of the patient's disease.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Mitral stenosis leads to increased left atrial pressure, causing both left atrial dilatation, which may result in atrial fibrillation, and an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure to overcome the increased left heart pressure (pulmonary hypertension). Over time, this will lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, splitting of S_2, and right ventricular hypertrophy (as indicated by the right axis deviation) to compensate. Right ventricular failure eventually manifests with characteristic features such as jugular venous distention and pitting edema.",

His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 96/70 mm Hg. Examination shows 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally. There is jugular venous distention. The jugular venous pressure rises with inspiration. Breath sounds are decreased at the lung base bilaterally. Cardiac examination reveals an early diastolic sound over the left sternal border. The abdomen is distended and a shifting dullness test is positive. An ECG shows low-amplitude QRS complexes. Chest x-ray shows small pleural effusions bilaterally and calcifications over the left cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography shows a 40% decrease in the velocity of peak diastolic blood flow across the mitral valve during inspiration. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular diastolic pressure with characteristic dip-and-plateau waveform. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "This patient with tuberculosis and dyspnea, ascites (distended abdomen, shifting dullness), and peripheral edema has a positive Kussmaul sign (increase in jugular venous pressure during inspiration) and a pericardial knock (early diastolic sound over the left sternal border). These features along with calcifications on chest x-ray and an exaggerated respiratory variation of blood flow on echocardiography indicate constrictive pericarditis, which may be confirmed by a positive square root sign on cardiac catheterization (dip-and-plateau waveform).",

        "explanation_why": "Pericardiectomy, along with the treatment of any underlying condition (i.e., this patient's tuberculosis), is the recommended approach for constrictive pericarditis. In constrictive pericarditis, a thick, rigid, and fibrous pericardium compromises cardiac function, which is restored by the removal of the fibrotic pericardium. In patients without signs of chronic constrictive pericarditis (i.e., no pericardial calcifications, atrial fibrillation, hepatic dysfunction, anasarca, or cachexia), pharmacotherapy can be attempted first. This can include NSAIDs, colchicine, diuretics, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory therapy; these measures should also be considered as adjuncts to pericardiectomy in chronic constrictive pericarditis.\n\nIn healthy individuals, the velocity of blood flow in the left side of the heart normally decreases with inspiration. However, in patients with constrictive pericarditis, this decrease in blood flow is exaggerated (> 25% decrease in diastolic flow across the mitral valve) because the rigid, fibrotic, shell-like pericardium impedes diastolic filling due to impaired relaxation of the left ventricle. In addition to these findings, an echocardiogram would show acoustic shadowing (caused by calcifications) and thickening of the pericardium.",

She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had an 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and 2 stents were placed. Intravenous unfractionated heparin was used prior to the procedure. Prior to admission, her medications were enalapril, simvastatin, and metformin. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, and blood pressure is 109/75 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Examination shows a tender lower abdomen; there is no guarding or rigidity. There is right suprainguinal fullness and tenderness. There is no bleeding or discharge from the femoral access site. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. A complete blood count shows a hematocrit of 36%, a leukocyte count of 8400/mm^3, and a platelet count of 230,000/mm^3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Administration of protamine sulfate is indicated for heparin overdose or major active bleeding on heparin therapy in order to bind heparin and reverse its anticoagulation effects. This patient received a dose of unfractionated heparin prior to surgery and active bleeding is suspected. However, unfractionated heparin has a half-life of only 30–60 minutes, and thus the remaining effect is most likely minor 1.5 hours after administration. Additionally, the decision as to whether reversal of anticoagulation is indicated in this patient should be based on the judgment of an experienced clinician and should include careful consideration of indications for anticoagulation and severity of bleeding. The diagnosis should therefore be confirmed first.",

        "explanation_why": "Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be performed in all patients with suspected retroperitoneal bleeding to confirm the diagnosis. While generally rare, retroperitoneal hemorrhage is the most common cause of unexpected mortality after diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. It often occurs when femoral access is obtained above the inguinal ligament, as compression of the puncture site is difficult in this area and sufficient hemostasis is not easily achieved. Patients usually become symptomatic after significant blood loss, which often leads to a late diagnosis of the condition. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage can also occur spontaneously or after only mild trauma in patients on oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin).",

Vasovagal responses can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress or arterial puncture in the catheter lab. While a vasovagal response would also manifest with hypotension, it would be combined with bradycardia and not the tachycardia seen in this patient. This patient's symptoms are most likely a compensatory response to active bleeding and subsequent hypovolemia.",

Although extremely rare (≤ 0.1%), a myocardial infarction is a possible complication to be considered in patients after cardiac catheterization. While myocardial infarctions can manifest with abdominal symptoms, they usually cause epigastric rather than inguinal pain. Additionally, this patient has hemodynamic signs of volume loss, which makes confirmation of suspected bleeding the priority in this patient.",

He has no history of serious illness and currently takes no medications. Despite appropriate safety precautions, he manages to leave the examination room unattended. Shortly afterward, he is found lying outside the emergency department. A visitor reports that she saw the patient climbing up the facade of the hospital building. He does not respond to questions but points to his head when asked about pain. His pulse is 131/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 105/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Physical examination shows a 1-cm head laceration and an open fracture of the right tibia. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Breath sounds are decreased over the right lung field, and the upper right hemithorax is hyperresonant to percussion. There is no jugular venous distension. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

On arrival, he is lethargic. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 10/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 94/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. He withdraws his extremities to pain. There are multiple bruises over his face, chest, and abdomen. Breath sounds are decreased over the left lung base. Two large bore peripheral venous catheters are inserted, and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Rapid sequence intubation is initiated, and orotracheal intubation via direct laryngoscopy is attempted three times without success. A laryngeal mask airway insertion also fails. Despite continuous bag-valve-mask ventilation, pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84%. The patient has no advance directive, and family members have not arrived. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Although video laryngoscopy could have been used earlier in the management of this patient, several intubation attempts have been unsuccessful. Furthermore, his oxygen saturation is acutely dropping despite attempts at maintaining ventilation and oxygenation through bag-valve and laryngeal masks. If establishing an alternative airway via video laryngoscopy is unsuccessful, hypoxic brain injury may occur. Another step is more appropriate in an emergency setting.",

After unsuccessful attempts at securing the airway and ventilation via orotracheal intubation, laryngeal mask placement, and bag-mask ventilation, immediate action is required to prevent hypoxia. A surgical airway with cricothyrotomy should be established in patients who cannot be intubated and oxygenated. Cricothyrotomy is the preferred method in an emergency when rapid airway control is needed, especially in cases where intubation is unsuccessful, and other supraglottic airway devices are ineffective.",

Menarche occurred at the age of 11 years, and menses occurred at 30- to 40-day intervals until pregnancy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 3-cm, firm, nontender, nonmobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. Ultrasound and ultrasound-guided core biopsy confirm an infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The pathological specimen is positive for estrogen and ERBB2 receptors and negative for progesterone receptors. Staging shows no distant metastatic disease. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Because her tumor is 3 cm, this patient is considered high risk and should therefore undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. Certain chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil) have a low risk profile and can be used in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Chemotherapy should be discontinued 3–4 weeks before delivery to reduce the risk of complications (e.g., transient neonatal myelosuppression, bleeding, sepsis) during childbirth and in the postpartum period.\n\nA 3–6 month delay in chemotherapy is associated with less favorable outcomes in nonpregnant individuals. Therefore, physicians should counsel patients through open communication and shared decision-making, according to their individual treatment needs. Patients have the right to refuse chemotherapy and/or delay treatment until after delivery.",

However, the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act implemented in November 2015 now allows transplantation of organs from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive recipients, provided the donor has an undetectable viral load, no prior history of an opportunistic infection, no active fungal infection, and a CD4+ count over 500 cells/μL for a 6-month period prior to donation. None of these restrictions apply to this patient. This patient's history of HIV does not, therefore, affect his eligibility to donate his organs to HIV-positive recipients. Donor organs from HIV-positive individuals are not transplanted to non-HIV-positive patients.",

He says that he has coughed up approximately half a cup of bright-red blood each time. He has had progressively worsening shortness of breath on exertion and a productive cough with occasionally blood-tinged sputum for the past 6 months. He has a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He drinks 2 to 3 beers every evening. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. His medications include amlodipine, tiotropium, and an albuterol inhaler as needed. His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 118/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 97/63 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. He appears anxious and cachectic. Auscultation of the lungs shows decreased breath sounds bilaterally. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. During the examination, the patient coughs up copious amounts of blood. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8800/mm^3, and platelet count is 160,000/mm^3. His coagulation parameters are within normal limits. Serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation of the lung fields and a 2-cm nodule in the right lower lobe. In addition to placing the patient in the right lateral decubitus position, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

A focused x-ray study is often the first imaging modality used in evaluating symptomatic metastases to nonvertebral bones. If x-ray shows a pathological fracture, further imaging with a CT scan or MRI is then indicated to evaluate the fracture and determine the need for surgery. Whole-body radiographs are mostly reserved for pure lytic bone metastases (e.g., from multiple myeloma).",

        "explanation_why": "Contrast-enhanced MRI of the spine is the imaging modality of choice for suspected vertebral bone metastasis, even in patients without neurologic findings (e.g., bowel or bladder incontinence, weakness, or sensory loss). MRI is also helpful for assessing potential epidural involvement and spinal cord compression, which is why it tends to be preferred over x-ray. The diagnostic approach to bone metastases differs depending on the site of metastasis. If metastases are suspected in the extremities, the first-line imaging study is plain x-ray. In addition, if this patient had back pain but no history of breast cancer, the index of suspicion for a secondary bone malignancy would be low; x-ray might be the first imaging study conducted in this case if there were a reason to suspect a primary bone tumor or spinal stenosis.",

First responders found the patient sitting on the curb experiencing pain where he had been stabbed. On arrival at the hospital, he is alert. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows several 1–2 cm lacerations and ecchymoses over the face and trunk. There is no neck crepitus. A pocket knife is lodged in the fourth parasternal intercostal space and there is a small amount of blood oozing out of the wound. There is no bubbling of the blood at the wound. The lungs are clear to auscultation with equal breath sounds. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray shows the knife in situ extending into the right thorax. Both lungs appear normal; they are homogeneously aerated and have no abnormal opacities. Size and shape of the heart are within normal limits. No fractures or tracheal deviation are visible. Both hemidiaphragms and costophrenic angles are sharply demarcated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

        "explanation_why": "Impaled foreign bodies should be removed under direct visualization in the operating room. As the knife is still in situ, the exact extent of intrathoracic damage is unknown. Although this patient is currently hemodynamically stable, he could have sustained vascular damage that is masked by the knife tamponading the stab wound and preventing hemorrhage at this time. Upon removal of the knife, the patient could hemorrhage and rapidly deteriorate. Emergency surgery is indicated to remove the knife in an environment in which bleeding can be controlled. Therefore, this patient should undergo rapid sequence endotracheal intubation in anticipation of emergency surgery. In hemodynamically stable patients, some surgeons first use video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery to evaluate the situs and, if safe removal of the foreign body is not possible with this technique, proceed to open thoracotomy.",

The most common indication is laryngospasm, an obstruction that prevents less invasive airway management. While an emergency procedure is required to remove the in situ knife and manage the injuries, cricothyroidotomy is not the first choice for airway management in this patient because there is no evidence of laryngospasm (e.g., stridor, shortness of breath, tachypnea) and other interventions to secure the airways have not been attempted.",

EDT is primarily recommended for pulseless patients with signs of life (e.g., measurable blood pressure, spontaneous breathing) following penetrating thoracic trauma. This patient, however, is hemodynamically stable with only minor bleeding from his chest wound; therefore, there is no indication for resuscitative thoracotomy.

Right ventricular volume overload due to the left-to-right shunt across the ASD causes a delayed closure of the pulmonary valve relative to the aortic valve. Since the right and left sides of the heart communicate, the pressure difference that normally exists during respiration evens out; therefore, the duration of the split does not change with inspiration or expiration. The increased blood flow through the right side of the heart also causes a pulmonary flow murmur, which explains the patient's systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. Some patients with ASD can also have a soft, mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border secondary to increased flow across the tricuspid valve.",

    "question_text": "Seven days after undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, a 51-year-old man has continued sternal chest pain. The pain is sharp and does not worsen with deep inspirations or when he is walking up and down the hospital hallway. He has mild shortness of breath. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/72 mm Hg. There is edema of the chest wall. The surgical incision site shows erythema. Cardiac examination discloses a crunching sound in synchronization with the heartbeat. Mildly decreased breath sounds are heard at the lung bases. His leukocyte count is 12,000/mm^3. Preoperative nasal swabs were positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures are pending. ECG shows low voltage and wide Q waves and T wave inversions in leads V_1 through V_3. Chest x-ray shows small bilateral effusions and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/72 mm Hg. There is edema of the chest wall. The surgical incision site shows erythema. Cardiac examination discloses a crunching sound in synchronization with the heartbeat. Mildly decreased breath sounds are heard at the lung bases. His leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3. Preoperative nasal swabs were positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures are pending. ECG shows low voltage and wide Q waves and T wave inversions in leads V1 through V3. Chest x-ray shows small bilateral effusions and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Chest pain, fever, leukocytosis, and local signs of inflammation at the sternotomy incision in combination with findings that indicate pneumomediastinum (i.e., a Hamman crunch on cardiac auscultation, widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, and low voltage QRS complexes) suggest postoperative mediastinitis. Although most patients present with purulent discharge from the sternotomy incision, some will only have deeper fluid collections visible on a CT scan of the chest.",

However, chest pain in patients with pneumonia is more commonly pleuritic rather than continued and these patients typically present with a productive cough. Moreover, HAP is likely to manifest with pulmonary consolidation on chest x-ray, which is not seen here.",

        "explanation_why": "Surgical debridement and IV antibiotics are the first steps in the management of postoperative mediastinitis. Surgical debridement must be performed as soon as possible to help reduce the likelihood of morbidity and mortality from the infection. Empiric intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered to cover both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. After receiving blood culture results, the antibiotic regimen should be narrowed. Risk factors for postoperative sternal wound infection include diabetes, obesity, peripheral artery disease, smoking, and prior cardiac surgery. Nasal colonization with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (one of the most common causal bacteria) prior to surgery is associated with a higher incidence of postoperative mediastinitis.\n\nThis patient's ECG findings of wide Q waves and T wave inversions in leads V_1 through V_3 are consistent with an old myocardial infarction. Small bilateral pleural effusions are a frequent finding after open cardiac surgery.",

Moreover, this patient has no other typical findings of PE, such as tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and features of deep venous thrombosis.

It is produced by prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery in combination with post-stenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The presence of bilateral rib notching indicates that the coarctation is distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries.",

In noncritical CoA, the left ventricular outflow obstruction leads to myocardial hypertrophy and increased collateral blood flow (e.g., to the intercostal arteries); rib notching occurs as a consequence of the collateral circulation between the internal thoracic and intercostal arteries and is usually a late finding (typically after 5 years of age).\n\nDoppler echocardiography is the confirmatory test of choice and should be performed in all patients with suspected CoA. It can identify the location and extent of the stenosis and show concurrent anomalies, such as a bicuspid aortic valve (present in ∼ 60% of patients).",

She reports that the episodes are worse when he is agitated and better when he sleeps in supine position. During this period he has had frequent regurgitation of his feeds. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation. The neonatal period was complicated by transient tachypnea. His immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 160/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 94/56 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Physical examination shows subcostal retractions. Stridor and diffuse wheezing are heard in the thorax. Anteroposterior and lateral x-rays of the chest show anterior tracheal bowing and narrowing. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

            "description": "X-ray neck of a young child (AP view)The upper tracheal air column, which normally appears with a square-shouldered configuration, has assumed a conical shape (green overlay) reminiscent of a church steeple (steeple sign; cf. illustration).The steeple sign indicates subglottic airway narrowing and is most commonly seen in croup. However, it may also appear in other conditions (e.g., bacterial tracheitis, tumors). An accompanying lateral radiograph might additionally show inspiratory overdistention of the hypopharynx.",

Hypoglycemia can manifest with lightheadedness, weakness, blurred vision, and nausea, with improvement of symptoms after oral intake of glucose (e.g., drinking juice). However, the association between arm activity (e.g., painting a mural) and her symptoms makes a drug side effect less likely.

Given this patient's vascular risk factors (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension), she most likely has an atherosclerotic occlusive plaque in the right subclavian artery. Reduced blood flow explains the heaviness, paresthesia, decreased pulses, and cooler skin of her right arm (i.e., upper extremity ischemia). Furthermore, exertion of the arm leads to retrograde blood flow through the vertebral artery so that the distal subclavian “steals” blood from the brain and causes her presyncopal symptoms (lightheadedness, nausea, and blurred vision) that resolve with rest.\n\nTreatment for subclavian steal syndrome involves control of atherosclerotic disease and antiplatelet therapy. Depending on the severity and location of the occlusion, percutaneous or open revascularization may be performed.",

If there is stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery, this leads to hypoperfusion of the upper extremities on the affected side (B). This is compensated by a contralateral circulation, in which there is increased blood flow from the unaffected side to the affected side via the vertebral arteries. As a result, there is hypoperfusion of the vertebrobasilar territory and corresponding central nervous system symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high in utero and decreases over the first few weeks of life. The progressive decrease in PVR and subsequent decrease in right ventricular pressure lead to increased left-to-right blood flow across the VSD. The enhanced shunting increases the overall volume of blood in pulmonary circulation, which causes increased lung perfusion (as evidenced by increased pulmonary vascular markings), increased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium, and left ventricular volume overload (resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy as evidenced on this patient's ECG and chest x-ray). These changes can lead to heart failure without cyanosis within the first few weeks to months of life, as seen in this child.\n\nIf the VSD is not repaired and pulmonary blood flow continues to be high, vascular remodeling in later stages will cause PVR to increase again, resulting first in right ventricular hypertrophy and persistent pulmonary hypertension and, eventually, shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome) resulting in heart failure with cyanosis.",

Blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (white arrow) along the pressure gradient (1). This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

The size of the defect is inversely proportional to the intensity of the murmur (i.e., small defects are associated with louder murmurs, while large defects may not have an associated murmur). A mid-diastolic murmur can also sometimes be heard with moderate or large VSDs due to increased flow across the mitral valve secondary to the left-to-right shunt.\n\nAfter a few years, a VSD can lead to pulmonary hypertension and a shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome) resulting in heart failure with cyanosis.

Cardiac examination shows a normal S_1 and a split S_2 during inspiration. A grade 2/6 soft mid-systolic murmur is heard maximally at the lower left sternal border. A contrast echocardiogram is performed and reveals a mild transient right-to-left interatrial shunt that becomes apparent when the child coughs.

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "A right-to-left interatrial shunt (made apparent by a saline bubble study on echocardiography) that opens during coughing is diagnostic of patent foramen ovale (PFO). During coughing, right-to-left shunting of blood can occur through this defect because of the transiently increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation (and consequently increased right atrial pressure).",

Typically, endovascular closure is performed in patients with recurrent ischemic events despite medical therapy and patients in whom long-term anticoagulation is contraindicated. Since this patient does not present with clinical manifestations of paradoxical embolism, percutaneous closure is not indicated.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's mild, asymptomatic PFO requires no further diagnostic procedure, follow-up, or treatment. A persistent foramen ovale occurs in approx. 25–30% of the general population and, since most patients are asymptomatic, is typically an incidental finding. A diagnostic workup (i.e., contrast echocardiography) and treatment (e.g., anticoagulation, closure of the defect) only become necessary if paradoxical embolism occurs. While this patient has a soft-mid systolic murmur that may be just an innocent heart murmur, she is well without signs of paradoxical embolism (e.g., stroke symptoms).\n\nA split S_2 during inspiration is physiological. If the S_2 splitting is fixed (persistently audible on auscultation during inspiration and expiration), there might be an underlying right ventricular overload (e.g., large atrial septal defects). PFOs are usually hemodynamically irrelevant and so do not cause fixed S_2 splitting.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In TVA, blood is unable to pass from the right atrium (RA) to the right ventricle (RV). Consequently, the RV is almost always hypoplastic. Venous blood, therefore, passes from the RA via an atrial septal defect (which, under these circumstances, is essential for survival) to the left atrium, where it mixes with oxygenated blood from the lungs. The mixed blood is pumped from the left ventricle (LV) into the systemic circulation (resulting in cyanosis) and pulmonary circulation (via a patent ductus arteriosus). LV hypertrophy occurs because the LV is single-handedly pumping blood through both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. A combination of RV hypoplasia and LV hypertrophy results in a severe left-axis deviation. Other findings that may be present on ECG include tall P waves (due to right atrial enlargement) and small R waves in the right precordial leads (e.g., V1, V2).\n\nThe majority of patients with TVA also have a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and concomitant pulmonary outflow obstruction. The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border arises from a VSD. In a patient with TVA, a single S_2 that does not split with respiration indicates severely limited blood flow across the pulmonary valve and/or severe pulmonary stenosis. The systolic murmur of a VSD is softer with increasing severity of pulmonary stenosis and/or increasing size of the defect, because both result in a decreased pressure gradient across the VSD. Prostaglandin-E1 is given to maintain PDA patency (thereby increasing pulmonary circulation and blood oxygenation), but definitive treatment is staged surgical repair.",

An additional finding is inferior rib notching (Roesler sign; examples indicated by arrowheads), which is produced by dilated intercostal arteries.The figure-3 sign of coarctation (indicated by red line) is seen in this patient. It is produced by prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery in combination with post-stenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The presence of bilateral rib notching indicates that the coarctation is distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries.",

Although this finding is classically associated with congestive heart failure in adults (especially in older individuals), some congenital cardiac defects can also cause this finding (e.g., truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return). In TOF (the most likely diagnosis in this case), there is a right ventricular outflow obstruction, leading to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature. Chest x-ray would more likely show decreased pulmonary vascular markings and a classic boot-shaped heart.",

The infant described here is lagging behind in terms of weight gain, but vital signs are within the normal range for a 5-month old infant (HR 80–160/min, RR 30–60/min).

Eventually, because of the increased blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, pulmonary hypertension may develop as well as Eisenmenger syndrome, which involves a shunt reversal.

However, as blood flows through the defect into the right ventricle, blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature increases as well and over time results in increased pulmonary resistance and, ultimately, Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). In this event, the defect becomes cyanotic and the peripheral oxygen saturation decreases. The body responds to chronic hypoxemia by increased erythropoietin production and a subsequent increase in red blood cells, i.e. polycythemia.",

    "correct_answer": "F",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "Cyanosis shortly after birth that does not improve with supplemental oxygen and a chest x-ray with the classic egg-on-a-string appearance (i.e., an enlarged heart with narrowed mediastinum due to an overlapping aorta and pulmonary trunk) are suggestive of a diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The holosystolic murmur indicates a coexistent ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is critical for life, as it allows for the mixing of oxygenated blood and its entry into the systemic circulation, especially after ductus arteriosus closure.",

The remaining ventricle is small and hypocontractile. Because tricuspid valve regurgitation is also usually present, there is retrograde flow in the right atrium, which is dilated by the volume overload, in addition to antegrade pulmonary blood flow. Blood flows through the patent foramen ovale or (commonly associated) atrial septal defect from the right atrium to the left atrium (right-to-left shunt) and then via the left ventricle into the circulation, resulting in pronounced cyanosis. The pulmonary circulation system may also be perfused through blood from the aorta (via the ductus arteriosus).",

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes.

The defect can either manifest with in utero heart failure (hydrops fetalis on ultrasound) or postnatal cyanosis, abnormal cardiac auscultation, and heart failure.",

            "description": "In the Ebstein anomaly, the tricuspid valve is displaced into the lumen of the right ventricle, resulting in atrialization of the right ventricle. The remaining ventricle is small and hypocontractile. Because tricuspid valve regurgitation is also usually present, there is retrograde flow in the right atrium, which is dilated by the volume overload, in addition to antegrade pulmonary blood flow. Blood flows through the patent foramen ovale or (commonly associated) atrial septal defect from the right atrium to the left atrium (right-to-left shunt) and then via the left ventricle into the circulation, resulting in pronounced cyanosis. The pulmonary circulation system may also be perfused through blood from the aorta (via the ductus arteriosus).",

While tuberculosis (TB) should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule, TB-related nodules typically appear as cavitations and calcifications on x-ray. Given this patient's recent visit to a TB-endemic country, active TB should also be considered. However, active TB is unlikely because of the short duration of the trip, the absence of other risk factors (e.g., immunosuppression), and the absence of symptoms (e.g., cough, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats). Regardless, IGRA is not used to diagnose active TB.",

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes. Chest x-ray in reactivation TB typically shows multiple cavities in the upper lobes, calcifications, patchy consolidations, and features fibroproliferative disease (e.g, scarring) due to inflammatory tissue destruction.",

Pulmonary nodules that are ≤ 4 mm in size and have a low risk for malignancy typically require no further evaluation or follow-up but a shared decision-making approach that takes patient preferences, cost, and available resources at the setting of care into consideration is recommended.

Individuals with limited-stage SCLC should receive treatment with curative intent. SCLC is usually unresectable and surgery is only considered in limited-stage disease with very small lesions and no evidence of nodal involvement (N0). This patient has N1 SCLC.\n\nSCLCs initially respond very well to chemotherapy, but remission only lasts for a short period of time. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is used to prevent the occurrence of brain metastases in patients with SCLC who have responded to initial chemotherapy. The average 5-year survival rate of patients with limited-stage SCLC is 10–15%.",

She reports that she sometimes has a feeling of “food getting stuck” in her throat and hears a “gurgling sound” from her throat while eating. She says that she occasionally coughs up pieces of undigested food. She has noticed a bad taste in her mouth and bad breath. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has been visiting Mexico every year for the past 7 years. She has Raynaud disease treated with nifedipine. Her father died because of gastric cancer. She smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but stopped 25 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9800/mm^3, and platelet count is 215,000/mm^3. ECG shows sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, halitosis, regurgitation, and coughing up of undigested food as well as her retrosternal pressure and the gurgling sound while eating are most likely caused by symptomatic Zenker diverticulum (ZD).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "ZD is a false diverticulum (herniation of mucosa and submucosa only) that typically herniates through the Killian triangle at the dorsal hypopharynx. The best confirmatory test in patients with ZD is barium esophagram with dynamic continuous fluoroscopy. The characteristic outpouching in the posterior pharyngoesophageal wall confirms the diagnosis.\n\nPatients presenting with symptomatic ZD should undergo open surgical or endoscopic treatment.",

This patient presents with some typical features of achalasia including dysphagia and regurgitation. However, achalasia often causes weight loss, which is not the case here, and it would not explain the bubbling sounds while eating. Esophageal manometry is also useful for detecting esophageal involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc), which often manifests with Raynaud disease, as seen here. The absence of other characteristic findings of SSc, such as thickening and hardening of the skin or sclerodactyly, however, makes this diagnosis less likely.",

Also, a CT scan of the neck and chest would not be the confirmatory test in the diagnosis of esophageal cancers. Larger outpouchings can be an incidental finding on CT scans of some individuals with ZD. However, a CT scan is not routinely used to confirm or exclude this diagnosis.",

Chagas disease may present with achalasia (megaesophagus), which typically leads to dysphagia and regurgitation, as seen in this patient. This patient's visits to Mexico, which is endemic for Chagas disease, increase her risk for this condition. However, megaesophagus typically occurs in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (approx. after 10–20 years), which is inconsistent with her travel history. Moreover, the chronic phase of Chagas disease would usually manifest with other symptoms including arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy (ECG shows no abnormalities) and/or abdominal complaints due to involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, neither of which is the case here.",

        "explanation_why": "In cholesterol embolization syndrome, ruptured plaque material can seed anywhere in the peripheral arteries, including the renal arteries, which subsequently impairs kidney function, manifesting as acute or subacute kidney injury. There is no specific treatment for cholesterol embolization syndrome. The mainstay of management is the prevention of recurrence, e.g., by optimizing the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Removal of the embolic source can be considered in consultation with a specialist. Options include surgical treatment (e.g., vascular bypass surgery, endarterectomy) and interventional treatment (e.g., angioplasty, endovascular stent grafting). Even with optimal treatment, the prognosis of cholesterol embolization syndrome remains poor.",

It is classically trauma-induced but can also be caused by shock and coagulopathy. Patients often present with signs of acute limb ischemia (the 6 Ps). Depending on the amount of internal tissue pressure, peripheral pulses are often still palpable (as in this patient). However, the combination of the warm foot, the localization of the pain (in the toes), and the amount of pain (not out of proportion to the extent of the injury) is inconsistent with compartment syndrome.",

    "hint": "The patient's clinical features indicate progressive mitral stenosis. The most common cause of mitral stenosis in a young adult is rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which usually develops 10–30 years after one or more episodes of rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever occurs during childhood following streptococcal pharyngitis and is characterized by fever and joint pain. A history of immigration from a developing country is an important risk factor for RHD.",

In some patients, the atrium may become so massively enlarged that it can compress the esophagus. In only very rare cases do patients develop esophageal compression that is severe enough to cause dysphagia (dysphagia megalatriensis).\n\nOther rare complications associated with massive enlargement of the left atrium include recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (Ortner syndrome) and massive hemoptysis due to erosion of the bronchial arteries.",

Gunshot wounds commonly injure the small bowel, colon, and liver, and a FAST exam cannot rule out all sources of abdominal bleeding. During expiration, the dome of the diaphragm may reach as high as the fourth intercostal space on the right and the fifth intercostal space on the left. For this reason, any penetrating injury below this level is treated as if it involves both the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Although this patient may also have a diaphragmatic and/or pulmonary injury, as indicated by the right lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray, this is unlikely to be responsible for his hypotension and tachycardia. Given the site of injury and equivocal FAST exam, an exploratory laparotomy is indicated to assess for potential intraabdominal injuries that may be the cause of his hemodynamic instability.\n\nOther indications for emergency laparotomy include evisceration, signs of peritonitis (abdominal pain with guarding/rebound tenderness), and free air under the diaphragm.",

This imaging technique typically shows an anechoic space between the pericardium and epicardium, indicating fluid accumulation. In a hemodynamically unstable patient like this one, an eFAST examination in the trauma bay is likely to reveal effusion; transthoracic echocardiography is used to evaluate the size and hemodynamic effect of the effusion and determine the best approach for draining the effusion. In patients with hemodynamic instability and evidence of cardiac tamponade on echocardiography, urgent pericardial fluid drainage (e.g., ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis) is indicated.",

She has squamous cell lung cancer, for which she has been receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide for the past month. She also has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are mildly decreased and heart sounds are muffled. Extremities are warm and there is pitting edema at both ankles. An x-ray of the chest shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette as well as opacities and cavitary lung lesions in the left middle lung zone. Serum studies show a slightly elevated troponin concentration, a creatinine concentration of 2.2 mg/dL, and urea nitrogen concentration of 45 mg/dL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia with low QRS voltage. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In this surgical procedure, part of the pericardium is removed to continuously drain excess fluid from the pericardial space into the pleural cavity, providing pericardial decompression. Pericardial window is often indicated in recurrent malignant pericardial effusion because it prevents the reaccumulation of fluid and, therefore, offers definitive treatment.",

Although this patient is known to have coronary heart disease, her history of lung cancer and recent pericardiocentesis, as well as evidence of cardiac tamponade, indicate recurrent malignant pericardial effusion.

Acute pericarditis typically manifests with low-grade fever, pleuritic chest pain, and pericardial friction rub on auscultation, none of which are seen in this patient. An ECG would show diffuse, concave-shaped ST elevations with or without PR depression.

Initially, the pain was only present when he was lying supine, but now it is constant and only subsides when he leans forward. He has hypertension and mild mitral regurgitation. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years but quit prior to surgery. Current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, captopril, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 38.3°C (102°F), pulse is 84/min and regular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 132/86 mm Hg. During inspiration, the patient's blood pressure drops to 117/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are jugular venous pulsations 4 cm above the sternal angle. Heart sounds are faint. There is 2+ edema in the lower extremities. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Postpericardiotomy syndrome typically manifests 1–6 weeks after cardiothoracic surgery as a result of an autoimmune inflammatory process in the pericardium. This syndrome may be accompanied by pericardial effusion, which can lead to cardiac tamponade, manifesting with muffled heart sounds and pulsus paradoxus. Fluid accumulation in the pericardial space leads to compression of the heart (especially the right ventricle because of its thin wall). This compression results in a shift of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle and impaired left ventricular diastolic filling (decreased preload). Cardiac output subsequently decreases and symptoms of backward heart failure (e.g., peripheral edema and jugular venous distension due to right-sided heart failure) and forward heart failure (e.g., progressive fatigue) develop.\n\nPericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that requires drainage of the pericardial fluid (e.g., using pericardiocentesis).",

Blood pressure control is essential in all patients with aortic dissection to prevent further progression of the dissection. Intravenous beta blockers (e.g., labetalol, esmolol) lower the heart rate and reduce the left ventricular ejection fraction, thereby reducing shearing forces within the aorta. If IV beta blocker therapy does not lower systolic blood pressure to 90–120 mm Hg, patients should also receive vasodilators (e.g., sodium nitroprusside). To avoid reflex tachycardia, beta-blocker therapy should be started before vasodilators.\n\nPatients with uncomplicated type B dissections do not require surgical intervention unless they develop complications (e.g., aortic rupture, renal failure, abdominal pain due to intestinal ischemia). Patients treated conservatively who develop worsening pain or features suggestive of complications should have vascular imaging repeated immediately.",

He has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and metformin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. He is in acute distress. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Cardiac examination shows a grade 3/6, high-pitched, blowing, diastolic murmur heard best over the right sternal border. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia and left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

It causes sudden severe pain, typically of the anterior chest (in an ascending dissection) or the back and interscapular region (in a descending dissection), which can migrate as the dissection progresses. Other clinical features include elevated blood pressure, asymmetrical blood pressure and pulse readings between limbs, diminished distal pulses, syncope, sweating, and confusion. Aortic dissection manifests as a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Extension of the dissection into the aortic valve causes aortic regurgitation. However, unlike the murmur of aortic regurgitation from aortic valve disease, which is prominent along the left sternal border, the murmur of aortic regurgitation from aortic dissection is prominent along the right sternal border.",

This patient has a saccular AAA that has rapidly grown over the past year and therefore requires surgery. Endovascular aneurysm repair is recommended for AAA in patients with suitable anatomy because it is minimally invasive and can be performed under local anesthesia.

The best results have been observed in young, healthy patients without other cardiac risk factors, such as this patient.

    "hint": "This patient presents with progressive fatigue, palpitations, and features of pulmonary congestion (exertional and nocturnal dyspnea, dry cough, bibasilar rales on auscultation). In combination with a heart murmur, these findings are highly suggestive of left-sided heart failure (LHF) caused by valvular heart disease. The auscultation findings reveal a systolic murmur heard best at the midclavicular 5^th left intercostal space (ICS), the area of the cardiac apex.",

    "hint": "Sudden and severe tearing pain, asymmetrical blood pressure readings, and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray are consistent with aortic dissection. Uncontrolled hypertension and chronic smoking are independent risk factors for aortic dissection. The moderate pulmonary hyperinflation in this patient is not the result of aortic dissection but caused by the concomitant COPD.",

Spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema can occur following spontaneous esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome), which can manifest with acute-onset chest pain and mediastinal widening (due to a pneumomediastinum). However, Boerhaave syndrome is usually preceded by a history of vomiting and/or severe retching, and features such as asymmetrical blood pressure readings are not be expected.",

If the dissection results in a tear of the tunica externa, aortic blood can leak into the pericardium. Pericardial fluid will decrease the transmission of heart sounds to the precordium.\n\nOther possible complications of ascending aortic dissections include myocardial infarction (due to coronary artery occlusion), aortic regurgitation (extension of the dissection into the aortic valve), and stroke (extension of the dissection into the carotids).",

        "explanation_why": "An early-diastolic “plop” is a pathognomonic sign for atrial myxoma, which does have a peak incidence between 40–60 years. However, myxomas typically occur among women and usually present as episodes of syncope, dyspnea, and/or palpitations, unlike this patient who presents with sudden-onset chest pain. Also, asymmetrical blood pressure readings would not be expected with myxomas.",

Furthermore, atherosclerotic lesions appear as hyperdense signals in the wall of the aorta. However, this patient's CT scan does not show any signs of aortic atherosclerosis.

        "explanation_why": "The patient has a diastolic murmur, which shortens the list of differentials here to mitral stenosis (MS), aortic regurgitation (AR), tricuspid stenosis (TS), and pulmonary regurgitation (PR). Let's have a look at the location of the murmur: it is best heard at the left sternal border near Erb point (cardiology). This location makes MS unlikely (usually best heard at the apex) but is consistent with a murmur caused by AR due to valvular disease. Now, here comes the tricky part. In this patient, TS and PR cannot be excluded by cardiac auscultation because the left sternal border is also the location at which murmurs due to TS and PR are best heard. However, subtle details make AR more likely. PR can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease (cor pulmonale) or chronic congestive heart failure, but this patient has no clinical features to suggest either of these etiologies. Isolated TS or PR are extremely rare (usually caused by endocarditis in intravenous drug users, or by congenital heart defects), and manifest with features of right heart failure, which are not seen here. This patient's history of emigration from Nepal increases the likelihood that the underlying etiology of valvular heart disease is rheumatic heart disease, which most commonly affects the mitral and aortic valves. In patients with AR, a widened pulse pressure (due to increased end-diastolic volume and a subsequent increase in stroke volume) is a common finding.\n\nOther common causes of AR include a congenital bicuspid aortic valve (most common cause of AR in high-income countries) and aortic root dilation due to connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). In contrast to AR due to valvular disease, the murmur of AR secondary to aortic root diseases is heard best over the right upper sternal border.\n\nTiming the murmur against the carotid pulse is an important skill to master; if you are finding it difficult to time the murmur, try listening to the murmur again between 10 and 20 seconds using a slow playback speed and gradually increase the playback speed until you are proficient in timing the murmur.",

Although the murmur that is characteristic of MS also occurs during diastole, it is most often a mid-diastolic decrescendo murmur preceded by an opening snap and is heard best at the cardiac apex. This patient has an early diastolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border that is associated with a widened pulse pressure, and his lungs are clear to auscultation, making another diagnosis more likely.",

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is one of the most common valvular abnormalities in the US, especially in young women. However, a widened pulse pressure is not common in MVP. Typical cardiac auscultatory findings of MVP would include a high-frequency, midsystolic click with a late systolic murmur that is heard best at the cardiac apex (left midclavicular line of the 5^th intercostal space).",

Empyemas most often result from the progression of an uncomplicated (sterile) parapneumonic effusion that becomes complicated (infected) and forms frank pus, but can also occur following a traumatic hemothorax, as in this patient. Treatment for empyemas involves chest tube placement to drain the empyema fluid and systemic antibiotic treatment.

The sign is the result of a fibrin pleural coat with capillary ingrowth and is considered reliable in distinguishing empyema from lung abscess.

Her operation was complicated by significant intraoperative blood loss, which prolonged the operation and necessitated 2 transfusions of red blood cells. She has hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient received prophylactic perioperative antibiotics and opioid pain management during recovery. Her temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 115/69 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft abdomen with mild tenderness to palpation in the left quadrants but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds are decreased.

This condition typically manifests with rapid onset of severe periumbilical pain, nausea, vomiting, and often, bloody diarrhea. This patient's rapidly worsening abdominal pain and bloody bowel movements are consistent with acute mesenteric ischemia. However, she lacks typical predisposing factors (e.g., atrial fibrillation, endocarditis), and, given the intraoperative blood loss she suffered during surgery, a different etiology is more likely.",

Risk factors include abdominal surgery, administration of opioids or anticholinergics, hypokalemia, and sepsis. Patients typically present with nausea, vomiting, decreased or absent bowel sounds as well as diffuse abdominal pain and distention 1–3 days after abdominal surgery. Because this patient received opioids for postoperative pain management, her risk of paralytic ileus is increased.

Intestinal ischemia caused by transient hypoperfusion may be seen in patients with acute hypovolemia (e.g., due to severe blood loss, as seen here) or vascular occlusion. The splenic flexure and the rectosigmoid colon are at highest risk of ischemia because of the watershed nature of the arterial supplies to these tissues (i.e., watershed area). Affected patients commonly report cramping abdominal pain (usually left-sided), bloody stools, and tenesmus. In severe cases, infarction of intestinal tissue leads to perforation of the bowel, sepsis, and death. Colonoscopy confirms the diagnosis.\n\nSee “Overview of intestinal ischemia” table.",

Symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain (classically postprandial), bloating, and nausea develops over months to years. Although this patient's diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia increase her risk of developing chronic mesenteric ischemia, her acute presentation with left-sided abdominal cramping and bloody stools suggests another etiology.",

Affected patients typically present with cramping abdominal pain, accompanied by frequent loose, watery stools that have a characteristic malodor. Major risk factors for C. difficile colitis include prolonged hospitalization and extended antibiotic therapy (especially with clindamycin, third-generation cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones). This patient's bloody bowel movements after a short course of perioperative antibiotics make C. difficile colitis an unlikely etiology.",

These findings suggest that parapneumonic effusion has progressed to pleural empyema, which is unlikely to resolve spontaneously. In addition to tube thoracostomy, all patients with pleural empyema should receive empiric antibiotic therapy. If tube drainage is inefficient (e.g., due to septation of the pleural fluid), further treatments, such as intrapleural administration of fibrinolytic agents, thoracoscopic debridement, and pleurectomy with lung decortication, may be necessary.",

Small VSDs may cause a loud systolic murmur with palpable thrill due to the large pressure differential between the left and right ventricles, while large VSDs are typically less obvious on auscultation. If left untreated, VSDs can lead to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.",

The Valsalva maneuver reduces both preload and left ventricular afterload, which would exacerbate the subaortic stenosis in HOCM but reduce the left-to-right shunt of blood in VSD.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "Intermittent leg pain on exertion (intermittent claudication) suggests lower extremity arterial insufficiency. The systolic ejection murmur described is likely due to aortic narrowing, and the erosions of the ribs suggest collateral circulation through the intercostal arteries (rib notching). Together, these findings indicate aortic coarctation.",

        "explanation_why": "An increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage is present in patients with untreated aortic coarctation because of brachiocephalic hypertension. Moreover, aortic coarctation is associated with intracranial aneurysm formation (due to hypertension and/or genetic risk factors), which increases the risk of hemorrhage due to aneurysm rupture. Other complications of aortic coarctation include aortic arch aneurysm and dissection, coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, endocarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure.",

It is not typically seen in aortic coarctation, which is considered an acyanotic heart defect.

Since both of these conditions are usually asymptomatic, intermittent claudication would not be expected.

        "explanation_why": "Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) include smoking, advanced age, atherosclerosis, and systemic arterial hypertension. Although aortic coarctation leads to brachiocephalic hypertension, the risk of AAA is not increased because blood flow in the vessels distal to the constriction at the aortic isthmus is actually decreased. Rather, increased blood flow proximal to the constriction increases the risk of dilation of the aortic arch (thoracic aorta). AAA is rare in children and when it occurs, it is usually due to an underlying connective tissue disease (e.g., Ehler-Danlos syndrome).",

        "explanation_why": "Failure of the ductus arteriosus to completely close postnatally allows blood to flow from the descending aorta back to the pulmonary artery (left-to-right shunt). In a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), this leads to volume overload of the right ventricle and the lung circuit. This increased blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension and irreversible remodeling of small pulmonary vessels, which may eventually lead to an Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). This patient's palpable right parasternal heave and pronounced S_2 are evidence of increased right heart strain. In patients with a large PDA, the features of differential cyanosis occur once shunt reversal develops. Because the ductus is located on the descending aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, reversal of the shunt results in deoxygenated blood reaching only the lower body. Due to the rise in pulmonary pressure, the characteristic continuous machine-like murmur heard in patients with PDA eventually disappears.\n\nInfants with PDA usually receive an infusion of indomethacin to induce closure of the duct, while in older children symptomatic PDAs are typically closed surgically or via percutaneous catheter occlusion. The presence of an Eisenmenger reaction is, however, a contraindication to a PDA closure.",

He drinks three beers and two glasses of whiskey daily. He currently takes dutasteride and tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia. His blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg supine and 100/70 mm Hg one minute after standing with no change in pulse rate. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor. On cardiac auscultation, there is a plopping sound followed by a low-pitched, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the apex.

Additionally, patients may present with constitutional findings (e.g., weight loss, fever, or anemia). The typical auscultatory finding (also present in this patient) is an early diastolic “plop,” caused by a movement of the mobile tumor mass, followed by a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apex that results from the obstructed blood flow through the mitral valve, and mimics the murmur of mitral stenosis.",

An additional finding is inferior rib notching (Roesler sign; examples indicated by arrowheads), which is produced by dilated intercostal arteries.The figure-3 sign of coarctation (indicated by red line) is seen in this patient. It is produced by prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery in combination with post-stenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The presence of bilateral rib notching indicates that the coarctation is distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries.",

    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "The presence of jugular venous distention suggests right heart failure, which can manifest with findings such as exertional shortness of breath and chest pain, as seen here. Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause pulmonary embolism, resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. A mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest confirms the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, and a normal PCWP (4–12 mm Hg) excludes left heart failure as the cause.",

Afferent arteriole dilation and efferent arteriole constriction then work in combination to maintain a constant GFR despite decreased cardiac output. Right heart failure is a condition that can cause systemic hypoperfusion. For this reason dilatation (not constriction) of the renal afferent arteriole would rather be expected in this patient.",

Other causes of AR include a congenital bicuspid aortic valve, rheumatic fever, and aortic root dilation due to connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). In contrast to AR due to valvular disease, the murmur of AR secondary to aortic root disease is heard best over the right upper sternal border (aortic area). In patients with AR, a high pulse pressure (due to increased end-diastolic volume and a subsequent increase in stroke volume) is a common finding.",

Although a long-standing, uncorrected VSD can also lead to decreased blood pressure, there is no evidence that it increases the risk of myocardial ischemia.",

Chronic hypertension proximal to the area of coarctation increases intraluminal pressure and subsequently weakens the arterial wall, potentially resulting in aortic dissection. Symptomatic coarctation in a 2-year-old child would most likely present with chest pain, cold feet, and lower-extremity claudication on physical exertion, none of which are seen in this patient. Furthermore, auscultation would reveal a systolic ejection murmur over the left paravertebral region and/or a continuous murmur below the left clavicula and between the shoulder blades.",

        "explanation_why": "Digital clubbing is a sign of chronic hypoxemia, which is a complication of an untreated VSD. VSDs are acyanotic congenital heart defects that manifest as a left-to-right shunt. An untreated VSD can lead to chronic volume overload of the right ventricle (RV) and subsequently increased blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature. This increased flow causes irreversible remodeling of the small pulmonary vessels, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and RV hypertrophy. RV pressure increases until it exceeds left ventricular (LV) pressure, at which point the shunt is reversed. This shunt reversal is known as Eisenmenger syndrome. Cyanosis and consequently, chronic tissue hypoxia, leads to the development of digital clubbing.\n\nChronic tissue hypoxia and megakaryocyte fragmentation are primary factors involved in the pathogenesis of digital clubbing. In Eisenmenger syndrome, blood can completely bypass the pulmonary vasculature, allowing whole megakaryocytes into the systemic circulation. Once these intact cells reach distal capillaries in the hands and feet, they impact and subsequently fragment. This fragmentation causes the release of platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, inducing angiogenesis and local mesenchymal growth and proliferation, which clinically manifests as digital clubbing.",

Oxygen saturation on room air is 81%. Examination shows central cyanosis. A continuous machine-like murmur is heard over the left upper sternal border. A single S2 heart sound is present. Supplemental oxygen does not improve cyanosis. Echocardiography shows the pulmonary artery arising from the posterior left ventricle and aorta arising from the right ventricle with active blood flow between the right and left ventricles. Further evaluation of the mother is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "correct_answer": "F",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Echocardiography showing a pulmonary artery arising from the left ventricle and aorta arising from the right ventricle confirms the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) which is an important cause of neonatal cyanosis that will not improve with supplemental oxygen. The continuous machine-like murmur indicates a coexistent patent ductus arteriosus, which is critical for life, as it allows mixing of oxygenated blood and its entry into the systemic circulation. Patients may also have coexistent arterial or ventricular septal defects that allow mixing of blood between the two circuits.",

Neonates with HLHS also have weak peripheral pulses, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis as the hypoplastic left ventricle cannot maintain adequate cardiac output.

Exertion, such as crying or feeding, increases the RVOO. This results in cyanosis (tet spells) due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD instead of the pulmonary valve, which in turn causes the murmur to become softer. The right ventricle hypertrophies because it chronically pumps against high resistance caused by the RVOO.\n\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during a tet spell. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases left ventricular pressure and decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the VSD. Infants who are having a tet spell should be placed with their knees toward their chest to achieve the same effect.",

In cardiac tamponade, the outward expansion of the right ventricle is limited, especially as blood flows during inspiration. This effect causes the interventricular septum to bulge into the left ventricle and together with a reduction in left ventricular filling causes a decrease in stroke volume as well as a subsequent drop in blood pressure.",

This patient's localization of Q waves in the anteroseptal leads (e.g., V1–V4) suggests an infarction of the left anterior descending artery, which supplies the anterolateral papillary muscle. Acute mitral regurgitation can lead to signs of heart failure, as seen in this patient.

        "explanation_why": "Mitral stenosis (MS) causes a left atrial outflow obstruction. The left atrium has to contract against the partially closed mitral valve, which results in an increased left atrial pressure. Once repaired, left atrial outflow increases, thereby decreasing the left atrial pressure. The left ventricular input increases, thereby increasing the left ventricular pressure. The right ventricular pressure remains unchanged. These hemodynamic changes would not, however, be expected after the closure of a VSD.",

        "explanation_why": "A VSD causes left-to-right shunting of blood because the left ventricular pressure is physiologically higher than the right ventricular pressure due to the thicker ventricular wall and higher force of contraction. Closure of a VSD would, therefore, increase the amount of blood in the left ventricle and decrease the amount of blood in the right ventricle during each cardiac cycle. This results in an increase in left ventricular pressure and a decrease in right ventricular pressure as well as right ventricular output, which translates to a decrease in the amount of blood flowing into the left atrium and therefore a decrease in left atrial pressure.",

Blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (white arrow) along the pressure gradient (1). This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

Coronary atherosclerosis leads to narrowing of the arterial lumen, which decreases the blood flow to the myocardium. During exercise, myocardial flow is unable to meet increased myocardial demand, which causes myocardial ischemia and symptoms of angina. While smoking increases the risk for MI, this man's history of acute onset, stabbing abdominal pain with an umbilical mass and hypotension suggest a different disease process.",

The pathophysiology of AAA is not fully understood, but numerous genetic and environmental factors, such as smoking, are believed to cause inflammation and proteolysis of connective tissue within the aortic wall. This leads to loss of structural integrity and weakening of the aorta. Other risk factors for AAA include advanced age and male sex. When high aortic wall stress is applied, as in hypertension, further weakening, widening, and rupture of the aortic wall can occur. AAAs are most commonly located below the renal arteries (infrarenal).",

In the postprandial period, there is a mismatch between low splanchnic blood flow and high intestinal metabolic demand, which leads to postprandial ischemia and abdominal pain within one hour of eating. Bloating, nausea, and weight loss due to food aversion are common symptoms.

Troponin levels are elevated and an ECG shows ST-elevations in the precordial leads. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention is performed, and a stent is successfully placed in the left anterior descending artery. Two days later, he complains of worsening shortness of breath. Pulse oximetry on 3L of nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. An x-ray of the chest shows distended pulmonary veins, small horizontal lines at the lung bases, and blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally. Which of the following findings would be most likely on a ventilation-perfusion scan of this patient?",

Bilateral increase in V/Q can be seen with exercise, during which there is physiologic vasodilation of the apical capillaries, resulting in increased perfusion of the apices with matched ventilation. A bilateral decrease in both ventilation and perfusion can be seen in patients with emphysema due to the destruction of both the alveoli and the capillary bed. Other possibilities include the combination of two separate conditions, of which one causes alveolar hypoventilation (e.g., opioid intoxication) and the other causes pulmonary hypoperfusion (e.g., right-sided heart failure, severe hypotension).

Given this patient's history of progressively worsening left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath, pneumothorax should be considered as a possible diagnosis. A tension pneumothorax can cause tracheal deviation away from the affected side, due to increased intrathoracic pressure. However, x-ray findings in pneumothorax would include absent lung markings and areas of increased radiolucency rather than the large opacity and air-fluid level seen here.",

Trauma to the chest can cause the ribs to pierce the pleura and damage intrathoracic vessels, which can lead to accumulation of blood in the pleural space. There is tracheal deviation to the opposite side due to the increasing volume in the pleural space. A hemothorax cannot be diagnosed with x-ray alone (diagnosis usually requires CT imaging or thoracentesis) but given the patient's recent trauma, this is the most likely etiology.",

This hemoglobin then degrades to unconjugated bilirubin, an insoluble product that is metabolized in the liver into conjugated bilirubin. Large amounts of unconjugated bilirubin can overload the liver's metabolic capacity, which leads to elevated (not low) levels of unconjugated bilirubin.",

Decreased serum ferritin concentrations indicate iron deficiency anemia, which would cause fatigue and shortness of breath but it would not cause dark urine or schistocytes in a peripheral blood smear. Instead, a peripheral smear would show hypochromic erythrocytes characterized by a region of central pallor that is greater than ⅓^rd the diameter of the erythrocyte.

Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta.

Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment. Anticoagulation with heparin, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or apixaban is also appropriate treatment for patients with PE.

        "explanation_why": "An aortic dissection is typically caused by a tear in the tunica intima and subsequent longitudinal extension of the dissecting hematoma. Hypertension, which increases the risk of endothelial injury, is the most common predisposing factor for aortic dissection. Most aortic dissections begin in the ascending portion of the thoracic aorta because this is the region of maximum hydraulic stress. Patients present with sudden and severe pain in the chest or interscapular region. The pain can migrate as the dissection progresses. Proximal extension of the dissection into the aortic valve ring can cause acute aortic regurgitation (AR), as seen here. Other features of aortic dissection include syncope, diminished distal pulses, and asymmetrical blood pressure and pulse readings between limbs. Unlike the murmur of AR from aortic valve disease, which is prominent along the left sternal border, the murmur of AR from aortic dissection is prominent along the right sternal border.\n\nNonmodifiable risk factors for aortic dissection include advanced age, male sex, and certain genetic conditions that weaken the tunica media (e.g., Marfan syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome).",

This creates a false lumen, which may rupture back into the true lumen of the aorta (reentry tear on illustration) or rupture through the tunica adventitia.",

Atherosclerosis is implicated in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms; atheroma ulceration has been reported in some patients with abdominal aortic dissections and descending thoracic aortic dissections. Although both aortic dissection and atherosclerosis share similar risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension, advanced age, and male sex), atherosclerosis is not a major risk factor for most aortic dissections, which tend to occur in the ascending aorta.",

RHD can cause a diastolic murmur (due to mitral stenosis), and, rarely, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia megalatriensis due to left atrial enlargement). Rheumatic fever, which is the pathologic precursor to RHD, would also cause pain in large joints such as the knee. However, the joint pain would subside after the acute episode of rheumatic fever, and the diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis would be heard best at the cardiac apex. This patient's murmur is caused by aortic regurgitation, which is not common in RHD. Most importantly, RHD would not cause dilation of the ascending aorta.",

Takayasu arteritis can, occasionally, lead to aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta with aortic regurgitation and dysphagia, which is seen here. However, the condition typically occurs in Asian women and would usually be associated with other features, such as cutaneous nodules, fever, or night sweats.",

In addition, arthralgia caused by SSc typically affects the small joints of the hands and feet, and the vasculopathy associated with SSc manifests as Raynaud phenomenon, telangiectasia, or thromboembolic phenomena.

However, in the case of aortic coarctation, the discordance is usually between the blood pressure measurements of the upper and lower extremities because the coarctation is typically located just distal to the left subclavian artery. Only in very rare instances would aortic coarctation cause disparate blood pressure measurements in the arms.

    "hint": "This patient has an aortic dissection, a condition that is typically precipitated by systemic hypertension and manifests with sudden-onset tearing or stabbing chest pain that radiates to the back. Aortic dissection may result in aortic regurgitation (due to involvement of the aortic valve), which causes an early diastolic murmur that is heard best at the right upper sternal border.",

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous sodium nitroprusside therapy can be used to control hypertension in patients with an aortic dissection. However, the first-line medical therapy for aortic dissection is an intravenous beta blocker, which decreases shearing forces in the aorta by lowering the heart rate and the left ventricular ejection fraction. Intravenous sodium nitroprusside therapy alone will induce reflex tachycardia (via activation of the sympathetic nervous system), which increases shearing forces in the aorta and may worsen the dissection.",

The next most appropriate step in management is an aortic imaging study to establish the diagnosis and classify the dissection.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Features of heart failure (e.g., irritability, poor feeding, failure to thrive) with a continuous murmur in the left infraclavicular region are highly suggestive of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), for which premature birth is a risk factor. The echocardiography findings confirm the diagnosis.",

Prostaglandins keep the ductus arteriosus patent, and by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin production and thus promote ductal closure. NSAIDs are only effective in preterm infants.\n\nTranscatheter or surgical closure is the treatment of choice for infants ≥ 6 kg, children, and adults. In preterm infants, procedural closure is generally only used if pharmacological treatment is unsuccessful.",

Other indications for AICD placement in patients with HOCM include a positive family history of SCD in a close relative ≤ 50 years of age, syncope of unknown cause, left ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≥ 30 mm, LV apical aneurysms, and LV systolic dysfunction. Patients with HOCM who are not in any of these categories still require risk stratification for AICD placement because of the high risk of SCD associated with this condition.\n\nBeta blockers are the first-line therapy for the symptomatic treatment of patients with HOCM. Other therapy options include nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, septal myectomy, and cardiac pacemaker. High-dose diuretics, spironolactone, and digoxin should generally be avoided.

He says his symptoms began while watching TV and resolved spontaneously after 10 minutes. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He had two myocardial infarctions over the past year. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 6 months ago. His medications are aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, ramipril, and atorvastatin. While the nurse is recording an ECG, his symptoms suddenly start again. The patient appears in mild distress but is alert and fully oriented. His pulse is 160/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Pulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown. One minute later, a repeat ECG shows the same findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

After one further sinus complex, the phenomenon repeats itself and initiates a more prolonged period of VT/TdP.",

The aspirated pleural fluid is analyzed (e.g., cytochemistry, cell count, pH, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose) and further categorized as a transudative effusion or an exudative effusion. Given this patient's smoking history and underlying cirrhosis, it is important to differentiate between hepatic hydrothorax (transudate) and malignant pleural effusion secondary to lung or liver cancer (exudate). In patients with large symptomatic pleural effusions, diagnostic thoracocentesis can be combined with therapeutic thoracocentesis to provide symptomatic relief.\n\nPleural fluid drainage is not required if the patient has bilateral pleural effusions that are asymptomatic, of equal sizes, suspected to be due to transudation (based on the presence of an underlying cause such as cirrhosis, cardiac failure, or nephrotic syndrome), and responsive to medical therapy (e.g., diuretics).",

    "question_text": "A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by paramedics 30 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to the left chest during an attempted robbery. On arrival, he is alert and oriented to person and place, but not time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a knife in situ that enters the thoracic wall just above the 7^th rib in the left midaxillary line. The right lung is clear to auscultation; auscultation of the left lung and cardiac examination remain inconclusive as the patient does not tolerate being examined near the entrance wound. Abdominal examination shows mild diffuse abdominal pain without guarding or rebound. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Five minutes later, the patient becomes unresponsive. Repeat vital signs are temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 120/min, respirations 28/min, and blood pressure 88/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The right lung is clear to auscultation; auscultation of the left lung and cardiac examination remain inconclusive as the patient does not tolerate being examined near the entrance wound. Abdominal examination shows mild diffuse abdominal pain without guarding or rebound. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Five minutes later, the patient becomes unresponsive. Repeat vital signs are temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 120/min, respirations 28/min, and blood pressure 88/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In cases of hemodynamic instability where there is a strong clinical suspicion of cardiac tamponade (e.g., muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins) or tension pneumothorax (e.g., absent breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion on the ipsilateral side), emergency pericardiocentesis or tube thoracostomy, respectively, should not be delayed by imaging.",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient's presentation should raise concern for aortic dissection, most likely involving the aortic arch and descending aorta. Syncope, a history of sharp back pain migrating to the abdomen, and evidence of perfusion deficit in the lower extremities (bilaterally decreased femoral pulses, leg paresthesia) are consistent with an aortic dissection that extends downward with successive occlusion of branching vessels (e.g., carotid arteries, abdominal arteries, femoral arteries).",

However, before proceeding to surgery, the diagnosis must be established and imaging is required.",

        "explanation_why": "Beta blockers (e.g., labetalol) may be used for hypertensive and/or tachycardic patients with confirmed aortic dissection if they are managed conservatively. Although these drugs can be administrated simultaneously while establishing the diagnosis in the case of a hypertensive emergency, this patient is hemodynamically stable and requires a definitive diagnosis first. Administering beta blockers prematurely before differential diagnoses have been ruled out may be harmful; e.g., it could lead to severe hypotension in a patient with a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Administration of beta blockers would also not be recommended if the patient required emergency surgery. A different step in management is indicated first.",

Further, nonspecific findings of aortic dissection in this patient include an elevated D-dimer level due to clot formation in the lumen and pleural effusion on chest x-ray.

In cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability (e.g., SBP < 90 mm Hg), thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) such as alteplase is indicated. Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment. Anticoagulation with heparin, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or apixaban is also appropriate treatment for patients with PE. However, these agents are typically used in patients who remain hemodynamically stable.",

The aortic arch and descending aorta are not affected. The right and left coronary, the innominate, the left common carotid, and the subclavian arteries originate from the true lumen (green overlay; false lumen is red overlay). Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta.

In patients with aortic dissection, inotropes should be avoided as they can increase shear stress on the aortic wall through increased force of ventricular contraction. Moreover, vasodilation can worsen this patient's hypotension. In patients with aortic dissection and hypotension, vasopressor support with norepinephrine or phenylephrine is recommended if the mean arterial pressure is < 70 mm Hg despite IV fluid therapy.",

Simultaneously to surgery, this patient requires management of hypotensive shock with IV fluids and, if necessary, vasopressors, as well as supportive care for pain and anxiety. Patients with uncomplicated dissections of the descending aorta (Stanford type B) can be treated conservatively with observation, blood pressure control, and analgesia unless complications develop (e.g., aortic rupture, renal failure, abdominal pain due to intestinal ischemia).\n\nElevated troponin I and lactate dehydrogenase levels indicate myocardial stress due to involvement of the coronary arteries, while D-dimer levels are commonly elevated in aortic dissection and may have prognostic value.",

        "explanation_why": "Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia most often seen in young children after cardiac surgery, particularly repairs involving the ventricular septum or near the AV node. JET originates from an automatic focus in or near the AV junction, resulting in a narrow complex, rapid, and regular tachycardia. Typically, retrograde P waves are seen immediately after each QRS complex, most clearly as negative deflections in leads II, III, and aVF. JET is notably resistant to AV nodal blocking maneuvers such as vagal stimulation or adenosine, distinguishing it from reentrant supraventricular tachycardias. An abrupt onset, hemodynamic instability, and ECG findings in a patient with recent cardiac surgery are characteristic of JET, which requires urgent identification and specific antiarrhythmic therapy to prevent cardiovascular collapse.",
