        "explanation_why": "Atropine is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist that is considered the antidote of choice for organophosphate poisoning, which is likely given this patient's symptoms of cholinergic crisis and history of farm work. Organophosphates are commonly used pesticides that cause irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, resulting in increased acetylcholine levels and both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor activation. Atropine competitively inhibits the effects of organophosphates at the muscarinic receptors.\n\nBecause atropine does not act on nicotinic receptors, it cannot reverse any neuromuscular dysfunction caused by organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime, a cholinesterase reactivator, is also effective in treating the nicotinic effects of organophosphates and should be given in addition to atropine.",

When he left their cabin 6 hours ago to get more firewood, she did not have any symptoms. Medical history is remarkable for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and migraines. Her medications are lisinopril, metformin, and ibuprofen as needed, but she ran out of antihypertensive medication over the weekend. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 154/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Her gait is unsteady. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Nausea and neurological symptoms (headache, confusion, agitation, short-term memory loss, gait abnormalities) in a patient with a history of staying in an enclosed space with a wood-burning stove or fireplace should raise concern for carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Patients with CO poisoning can have a normal SpO_2 because pulse oximetry cannot distinguish between carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and oxyhemoglobin.",

However, an acute deterioration due to hypertension is usually seen in patients when blood pressure is > 180/120 mm Hg and/or if intracranial hemorrhage occurs.

Because this patient has carbon monoxide poisoning, she requires treatment with high oxygen tension. Administering 100% oxygen via a nonrebreather mask is typically the first step in management. However, this woman shows signs of neurological dysfunction (e.g., confusion, agitation), which suggests a COHb level > 30%.

The mixture has lower density than room air and is therefore more likely to retain laminar flow in central airways and elicit less effort to breathe than room air. Decreasing the density would not facilitate the clearance of carbon monoxide or improve the patient's oxygenation.",

During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 mL of turbid fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows:\n\nErythrocyte count\n0,000001 million/mm^3\n\nLeukocyte count\n4000/mm^3\n\nGlucose\n59 mg/dL\n\nLactate dehydrogenase\n248 U/L\n\nProtein\n3.8 g/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?",

Malignant effusion is caused by cancer-related barrier dysfunction of the capillary walls, which leads to increased permeation of plasma protein, blood cells, and tumor cells. These effusions are usually exudative and cell-rich, with a cloudy or straw-like appearance, abnormal cytology, a glucose concentration < 60 mg/dL, pH < 7.2, and high concentrations of LDH (> 0.45 x normal serum LDH) and amylase (> 200 mg/dL).\n\nIn addition to addressing the underlying malignancy, symptomatic malignant pleural effusions can be treated with therapeutic thoracocentesis and, if the effusion is expected to reaccumulate rapidly or frequently, an indwelling pleural catheter or chemical pleurodesis.",

There is no personal or family history of serious illness in the family. The last vaccination the boy received was against varicella 2 years ago; he has never been immunized against rabies. He is not in acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 2-cm (0.8 in) puncture wound on his left calf; there is minimal erythema around the wound. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. The wound is irrigated and washed with saline and chlorhexidine solution.

        "explanation_why": "Following a provoked bite injury by a domestic carnivore that does not display symptoms of rabies, a 10-day observation period of the animal is the next best step for assessing the risk of rabies. Because rabies has a long incubation period (usually 1–3 months) and animals that can transmit rabies develop symptoms within 5–10 days, postponing PEP to observe the animal is safe. If the dog maintains normal behavior for the duration of the observation, no PEP is necessary. If the dog develops symptoms of rabies, the dog is tested and PEP is initiated in the patient. If the tests are negative, PEP is discontinued.\n\nAn important exception is a bite wound to the head or neck (closer to central nervous tissue), as there are reports of cases in which rabies infection occurred within 4 days of exposure. Therefore, PEP should be initiated immediately in patients with bite wounds to the head or neck.",

On arrival, he is lethargic and unable to provide a history. He vomited multiple times on the way to the hospital. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 55/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 98/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 80%. Examination shows profuse diaphoresis and excessive salivation. He sluggishly withdraws his extremities to pain. The pupils are constricted and reactive. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There are fine fasciculations in the lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle strength is reduced and deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. His clothes are soaked with urine and feces. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in pharmacotherapy?",

    "hint": "This patient presents with features of cholinergic crisis (DUMBBELLSS: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis/Muscle weakness, Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Emesis, Lacrimation, Lethargy, Salivation, and Sweating), which should raise concern for organophosphate poisoning.",

        "explanation_why": "Urine alkalizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) are indicated for barbiturate poisoning. Although barbiturate poisoning can manifest with some of the features seen in this patient (e.g., altered mental status), this condition is usually associated with bradypnea and hypothermia rather than tachypnea and sweating.",

This patient likely has been exposed for > 1 hour since he was discovered by his wife 45 minutes prior to presentation. Regardless, this patient's airway is compromised (he is disoriented, tachypneic, and hypoxemic), so an enteral binding agent would be contraindicated.",

        "explanation_why": "Atropine, an anticholinergic agent that competitively blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, should be administered promptly to counteract the life-threatening muscarinic effects (bronchospasm, bronchorrhea) of organophosphate poisoning. Atropine dosing should be doubled every 3–5 minutes until bronchial secretion and wheezing stop. Following atropine administration, patients should also be given an oxime (e.g., pralidoxime) to counteract nicotinic effects (e.g., neuromuscular dysfunction) because atropine does not act on nicotinic receptors. Management of organophosphate poisoning also includes patient decontamination (e.g., removing clothes, cleaning the skin) to prevent absorption of the offending agent through the skin, benzodiazepines to control organophosphate-induced seizures, oxygen therapy, and endotracheal intubation.",

The symptoms of organophosphate poisoning are not mediated by α-adrenergic receptors. α-adrenergic antagonism would not improve this patient's symptoms, and could even worsen his hypotension.",

Oximes can, however, induce a transient increase in acetylcholinesterase inactivation, which would worsen this patient's symptoms. Therefore, these agents should only be administered after treatment with another drug has been initiated.",

He is from India and is visiting his family in the United States. He drinks one to two pints of vodka daily. He works in a battery manufacturing factory. He appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows transverse white lines on his fingernails and toenails. There is spotty hyperpigmentation and nodular confluent thickening over the palms, soles, and abdomen. Muscle strength is decreased in the hands and feet bilaterally. Sensation to vibration, fine touch, and temperature is decreased in the hands and feet. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He had some difficulty swallowing his food during lunch and has weakness in both arms. Two weeks ago, he had an upper respiratory infection that resolved spontaneously. He lives independently and returned from his grandparents' farm 2 days ago. He commonly consumes home-canned vegetables and fruits. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 10/min and labored, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows bilateral nystagmus and ptosis. The pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. Muscle strength of the facial muscles and bilateral upper extremities is decreased. Upper extremity deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause for this patient's symptoms?",

Although organophosphate poisoning commonly occurs on farms and causes weakness and paralysis, it is typically associated with increased salivation, diarrhea, uncontrolled urination, bronchospasm, and tremor. Additionally, increased acetylcholine activity would result in miosis rather than mydriasis.",

Initial manifestations include internuclear ophthalmoplegia and retrobulbar neuritis, followed by loss of vibration and touch, upper motor neuron weakness, Charcot neurological triad, cranial nerve palsies, and autonomic dysfunction. Although this patient also has muscle weakness, hyporeflexia is not a typical finding of MS and instead suggests a problem originating from the lower motor neuron and/or the neuromuscular junction.",

Although MG manifests with weakness of the eye muscles, bulbar muscles, and proximal limbs, it most often occurs in young women and tends to worsen with increased activity. MG muscle weakness is generalized and more prominent in the proximal limbs, whereas this patient presents with weakness predominantly in the upper extremities. Also, MG usually follows a more gradual course with progression of symptoms over months to years. While this patient presents with hyporeflexia, deep tendon reflexes are typically normal in patients with MG.",

        "explanation_why": "Tetanus occurs when Clostridium tetani spores contaminate a wound (e.g., through dirt or saliva) and produces neurotoxins such as tetanospasmin. Tetanospasmin is transported to the CNS via retrograde axonal transport and prevents the release of GABA and glycine inhibitory neurotransmitters from interneurons, causing uncontrollable muscle contractions. Because this patient does not report any trauma, tetanus is unlikely. In addition, tetanus is characterized by the typical triad of trismus, risus sardonicus, and opisthotonus, rather than paralysis.",

Symptoms of botulism include cranial nerve abnormalities such as accommodation paralysis and mydriasis, which eventually result in peripheral flaccid paralysis that progresses caudally, causing difficulty swallowing, breathing, and weakness of the arms and legs. Foodborne botulism occurs when preformed toxins in foods contaminated with Clostridium botulinum are ingested. Botulinum toxins are most often found in home-canned foods and packed meats.",

The condition usually occurs 1–4 weeks after an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection and is characterized by flaccid paralysis. Although this patient has motor paralysis and had an upper respiratory infection 2 weeks ago, paralysis in GBS is typically ascending and respiratory motor function is usually one of the latest clinical manifestations.",

There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He drinks one pint of rum daily. He works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

SCD may result in multiple falls as a result of sensory ataxia and/or lower limb weakness. However, patients would be able to perform a Romberg test, unlike this patient. To maintain balance, at least 2 of the 3 following sensory inputs are necessary: vision, proprioception, and vestibular function. By taking away vision input upon closing the eyes during a Romberg test, a patient with defective proprioception (as in SCD) loses balance and the test is positive. Also, this patient has normal muscle strength as well as intact vibration and joint position sense in the lower limbs, which would be absent in SCD.",

Degeneration of the superior cerebellar vermis is the most common cause of subacute or chronic ataxia in patients with excessive alcohol use. Cerebellar degeneration in this patient group occurs due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol or as a result of thiamine deficiency.\n\nPatients with severe thiamine deficiency may also develop Wernicke encephalopathy as a result of neuronal injury in the thalamic nuclei, mamillary bodies, periaqueductal gray matter, and/or floor of the fourth ventricle.

Heat-induced damage to the vascular endothelium results in the release of cytokines and heat shock proteins that cause leukocytosis (due to a systemic inflammatory response) and DIC, which would explain this patient's thrombocytopenia and multiorgan dysfunction.",

Prostaglandin E2 concentration increases as a response to endogenous and exogenous pyrogens and displaces the set point of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center upward. Since increased body temperature in heatstroke develops as a result of impaired heat dissipation, and it is not cytokine-induced, antipyretics are not effective in the treatment of heatstroke. Administration of acetaminophen or NSAIDs may even be harmful as it can exacerbate complications including acute kidney injury, hepatic failure, and the risk of bleeding in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Nonexertional heatstroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's hypothalamic thermoregulatory response is inadequate to maintain a normal temperature. The normal physiologic response to increased body temperature is hypothalamus-mediated peripheral vasodilation (to expose blood to the cooler air) and sweating (to dissipate heat into the environment). In older individuals, these control mechanisms are impaired because of reduced vasodilation and surface area for conductive heat loss. Accordingly, the hypothalamus is less able to adequately regulate temperature in this population, thereby increasing the risk for heatstroke. Treatment for heatstroke consists of rapid reduction of the core body temperature to 39°C (102.2°F) via conductive cooling (immersion in ice water). If immersion is not possible or insufficient, other active cooling methods (e.g., spraying cold water, fanning, cold IV crystalloids) can be considered.",

However, he has no focal neurological symptoms such as loss of vision, aphasia, hemiparesis, or paresthesias, which would be expected. The combination of severe hyperthermia, anhidrosis, and altered mental status make another diagnosis more likely.",

    "hint": "In the early phase of aspirin toxicity, patients develop respiratory alkalosis as a result of hyperventilation (due to direct stimulation of the respiratory center in the medulla by salicylate). In the late phase, which occurs several hours after ingestion, patients develop an additional high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) primarily because salicylate uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increases the conversion of acetyl-CoA and pyruvate to ketoacids and lactate respectively.",

        "explanation_why": "The time that has elapsed since aspirin ingestion indicates that the patient would have both HAGMA and respiratory alkalosis. A low HCO_3^- concentration is consistent with metabolic acidosis and an anion gap that is expectedly high (18 mEq/L) is obtained when using the measured Na^+ and Cl^- concentrations and an HCO_3^- concentration of 19 mEq/L. For a patient with metabolic acidosis, the Winter formula, i.e., expected P_aCO_2  = = (1.5 x HCO3^-) + 8 (+/- 2), is used to estimate the expected change in P_aCO_2 by physiological compensation alone. In order to be consistent with an additional respiratory alkalosis, the measured P_aCO_2 must be less than the expected P_aCO_2. For an HCO_3^- concentration of 19 mEq/L, a measured P_aCO_2 of 30 mm Hg is lower than the expected P_aCO_2 (34.5–38.5 mm Hg) and is therefore consistent with the expected findings. In patients with mixed acidosis and alkalosis, the pH can be normal.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has multiple signs and symptoms of lead toxicity, including evidence of cognitive deficits (language delay), behavioral problems, fatigue, constipation, abdominal pain (lead colic), gingival hyperpigmentation (Burton line), and microcytic, hypochromic anemia. For symptomatic patients (without evidence of encephalopathy) and blood lead levels ≥ 45 mcg/dL, chelation therapy with dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer) and calcium disodium edetate (CaNa_2EDTA) is appropriate. Chelation therapy with dimercaprol (BAL) is an alternative treatment option, although dimercaptosuccinic acid can be administered orally and is usually better tolerated.\n\nMeasurement of the venous blood lead level is necessary to establish the diagnosis. Fingerstick blood sampling is often used for screening purposes, but elevated lead levels must be confirmed by venous sampling. Because most children with lead poisoning are initially asymptomatic, screening is recommended for high-risk populations, including children living in older housing under renovation or with peeling paint, recent immigrants (such as this patient), refugees, or foreign adoptees, and children who have a sibling or playmate with lead poisoning. This child's environment should be inspected for lead sources to prevent further exposure.",

His mother says her son was playing with some new toys, including a squirt gun, a robot, and some plastic building blocks he got for his birthday when the symptoms began. The coughing lasted several minutes, after which he was crying but could be soothed by his mother. He is otherwise healthy and his immunizations are up-to-date. He is alert and babbles. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 139/min, respirations are 34/min, and blood pressure is 96/47 mm Hg. The oropharynx is clear and cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender to palpation. X-rays of the chest are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management?",

His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 139/min, respirations are 34/min, and blood pressure is 96/47 mm Hg. The oropharynx is clear and cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender to palpation. X-rays of the chest are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management?",

Removal should not be delayed, even if the patient has eaten. Endoscopic removal allows visualization and assessment of any tissue damage. The position of the negative pole of the battery should also be assessed during endoscopy. The negative pole causes the most severe necrotic injury. Possible complications of a mucosal injury include tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia, fistula, perforation, and mediastinitis.",

        "description": "X-ray chest (PA and lateral views) of a young childA well-defined disc-shaped metallic foreign body is seen behind the trachea in the upper esophagus. On close inspection, a double rim (dashed lines), or halo (green overlay), is visible on the PA view, which indicates that it is a button battery. A step-off (arrows) to the small diameter anode (hatched green overlay) is seen on the lateral view.Recognition of a button battery in the esophagus is a pediatric emergency. Radiographs can frequently differentiate button batteries from similarly sized coins and ascertain the direction of the anode, where the most severe damage from the battery occurs. The anode step-off (arrows) may not be visible on some very thin batteries.",

It works by reducing hepatic iron stores, which in turn reduces the accumulation of porphyrins. Following remission, routine phlebotomy may be necessary to prevent recurrence of symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine is also an effective treatment for inducing remission of PCT, but contraindications (e.g., history of retinal disease) should be considered. Iron-chelating agents, such as deferoxamine, may also be indicated if phlebotomy is inadequate. In addition to induction of remission, select patients should receive genetic testing and counseling, particularly if they have a family history of PCT, as is likely in this patient. Regular measures for sun protection and avoidance of precipitating factors (e.g., exogenous estrogen use) should also be practiced.",

It works by forming water-soluble complexes with porphyrins, which the kidneys can then excrete. However, there is a risk of retinal damage with hydroxychloroquine treatment, and it is contraindicated in patients with a history of retinal disease, as in this patient. Additional contraindications to hydroxychloroquine use include advanced liver and renal disease and psoriasis (which may flare with hydroxychloroquine treatment).",

He says that he first noticed some reddening of the skin on his back the previous evening, which turned into a blistering, red rash overnight. He went surfing the previous day and spent 5 hours at the beach. He reports having applied at least 1 oz of water-resistant SPF 30 sunscreen 30 minutes before leaving his home. His vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination shows erythema of the skin over the upper back and dorsum of the neck, with 3 vesicles filled with clear fluid. The affected area is edematous and tender to touch. Which of the following recommendations is most appropriate to prevent a recurrence of this patient's symptoms in the future?",

        "explanation_why": "To provide adequate protection against sunburn, sunscreen with an adequate sun protection factor (SPF) should be applied at least 30 minutes prior to sun exposure and again after each exposure to water or after sweating. This patient's sunburn is likely due to the fact that he did not reapply sunscreen at any point during the 5 hours he was surfing. Even if this patient had not been swimming or surfing, sunscreen should be reapplied every 2–3 hours to prevent sunburn.",

There are other factors concerning the application of sunscreen that contributed more to this patient's sunburn.",

UV radiation is also more intense at higher altitudes.",

He reports feeling cold, with severe pain in his hands and face. He remembers having lost his gloves last night. His rectal temperature is 35.2°C (95.3°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased sensations over the distal fingers, which are cold to touch. The skin over the distal phalanges is cyanotic, hard, waxy, and tender, with surrounding edema.

The affected extremity should be immersed in a warm (preferably 37–39°C), circulating water bath. Passive rewarming is also helpful (especially in patients with mild hypothermia) and includes removing any wet clothes, covering with blankets, and increasing the temperature of the room.\n\nIn patients with concomitant moderate-to-severe hypothermia, treatment of hypothermia should take priority because it can be acutely life-threatening. The trunk should be warmed prior to the extremities, as peripheral vasodilation may lead to a return of cold blood to the heart, which increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.",

He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal examination shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation.

While it would also be effective in treating this patient's food allergy, first-generation antihistamines have anticholinergic side effects that can cause mydriasis and trigger an acute attack in patients with a history of narrow-angle glaucoma.

Although it would also be effective in treating this patient's food allergy, first-generation antihistamines have anticholinergic side effects that can cause mydriasis and trigger an acute attack in patients with a history of narrow-angle glaucoma. Therefore, chlorpheniramine is contraindicated in this patient.",

However, this group of agents has anticholinergic side effects, such as mydriasis, which can induce acute angle-closure glaucoma in patients like this one with a history of narrow-angle glaucoma. Since first-generation antihistamines are contraindicated in this patient, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is a second-generation antihistamine such as fexofenadine, which is similarly effective but has fewer sedative and anticholinergic side effects.",

During the accident, the boy's right eye was exposed to potassium hydroxide. He has severe pain in his right eye and reports difficulty keeping the eye open. The boy states he was wearing his prescription glasses when the accident occurred and that, immediately after the accident, his eye was irrigated thoroughly with cold tap water for approximately 5 minutes by the teacher. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/78 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination of the right eye shows erythema and blistering of the skin over the eyelid, with conjunctival congestion and excessive tearing in the eye. There is a partial thickness laceration above the right eyebrow. Further examination is impeded due to marked blepharospasm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "B",

    "hint": "This patient's clinical features (ocular pain, conjunctival congestion, excessive tearing, marked blepharospasm), which appeared after exposure to a caustic chemical, indicate a chemical ocular burn.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Immediate and thorough irrigation with sterile normal saline (e.g, via a plastic scleral lens) following an ocular chemical burn is the most important step to prevent permanent vision loss. Immediate irrigation initiated by first responders should continue for at least 30–60 minutes or until the pH of the eye has normalized. This process can sometimes take 2–3 hours for alkaline compounds such as potassium hydroxide because they are lipophilic and thus penetrate tissue more quickly. This patient has ongoing symptoms after just 5 minutes of irrigation. Continued irrigation in the emergency department should therefore begin immediately. Once irrigation is completed and the pH has normalized, broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be administered.",

However, steroids might have a negative impact on reepithelialization and increase the risk of secondary infection. Thus, they should be used with caution and for a limited amount of time only.

Although this patient's eyebrow laceration suggests possible blunt force trauma, addressing the chemical burn to the eye should be the first step in management. Furthermore, crossed bandaging after a chemical ocular burn could increase the risk of a symblepharon, thus leading to further complications.",

        "explanation_why": "An elevated blood level of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) confirms carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can leak from a malfunctioning furnace. CO has a greater affinity for hemoglobin (Hb) than oxygen does, so when it binds to Hb it reduces Hb's oxygen-carrying capacity and shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, thereby decreasing O_2 release in tissues. This leads to tissue hypoxia and metabolic acidosis, as seen here. Note that PaO_2 is normal as it reflects the amount of dissolved O_2 in the blood, which is not affected by CO. Likewise, SpO_2 will be normal if a standard pulse oximeter is used, as those cannot differentiate between COHb and oxyhemoglobin.\n\nSymptoms of CO poisoning are variable and depend on the COHb level. Nausea, headache, and dizziness are common early signs. After exposure to high levels of CO, patients may develop a cherry-red skin tone, but this finding is more commonly seen postmortem. Treatment includes supportive care, 100% O_2, and occasionally hyperbaric oxygen therapy.",

Of these compounds, tryptase is a relatively specific marker of mast cell activation.\n\nIn the late phase of anaphylactic reactions, inflammatory cells (e.g., eosinophils) and cytokines mediate inflammation and tissue damage.",

Although serum sickness (or a serum-sickness like reaction) may present with urticaria, this patient lacks other characteristic findings such as fever, arthralgia, proteinuria, and lymphadenopathy. Moreover, serum sickness typically occurs 1–2 weeks after antigen exposure (unlike this patient's acute-onset symptoms). Cathepsin is not released by surface crosslinking of IgE.",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient presents with nausea, headache, confusion, and short-term memory loss. These symptoms, together with a history of staying in an enclosed space with a gas or wood-burning stove or wood fire (commonly used in cabins during the winter), are consistent with the diagnosis of carbon monoxide (CO) toxicity. Patients with CO poisoning can have a normal SpO_2 because pulse oximetry cannot distinguish between carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and oxyhemoglobin.",

The mixture has lower density than room air and is therefore more likely to retain laminar flow in central airways and elicit less effort to breathe than room air. Decreasing the density would not facilitate the clearance of carbon monoxide or improve the patient's oxygenation.",

Gliadin is deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and then ingested by antigen-presenting cells (APC), which activate T cells via MHC II receptors. The activated T cell then activates plasma cells to release anti-tTG, anti-endomysial, and anti-deamidated gliadin antibodies (which all function as diagnostic markers of celiac disease). T cells also differentiate into TH1 cells, which activate cytoplasmic fibroblasts to release matrix proteases. This leads to the destruction of the intestinal architecture with villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and the loss of the brush border.",

Chronic mercury toxicity manifests with neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, erethism mercurialis (abnormal irritability), ataxia, and tremor. Various degrees of polyneuropathy may also be observed. Another common sign is gingival and/or buccal inflammation with a characteristic blue‑violet discoloration. This patient's history of working in a metal refinery further supports this diagnosis. Finally, treatment includes administering dimercaprol, a chelating agent used to reduce serum mercury levels. The chelating agents 2,3 dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) can also be used to lower mercury levels.\n\nLead poisoning would manifest with symptoms very similar to the ones in this case, including neuropsychiatric disturbances and anorexia. Dimercaprol is also the first-line treatment. However, this patient's prominent excess salivation, odynophagia, and gingival inflammation would not be expected in cases of lead poisoning.",

Chronic toxicity most often causes non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, chest pain, and headache. Neither acute nor chronic exposure cause gingivobuccal inflammation, tremor, or ataxia. Finally, cyanide toxicity is usually treated with a combination of sodium thiosulfate and hydroxocobalamin or a combination of amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate, but not with dimercaprol.",

Two days ago, she was camping outdoors in Texas with her two young children. She was awoken in the middle of the night by “something crawling on my hand.” The following morning, she saw a wound on her hand that was initially painless, but over the next several hours she noticed reddening and blistering. Yesterday, the lesion turned blue with a blackish discoloration at the center. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema at the dorsum of the right hand. Which of the following animals is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms?",

They produce venom composed of various enzymes, some of which cause local destruction of tissue integrity, leading to the breakdown of skin, adipose tissue, vasculature, and eventual tissue death. Bites are initially painless but form into an erythematous, painful blister over the course of several hours. Progressive tissue death and bluish-black skin discoloration are seen in the first 24 hours, followed by tissue necrosis and eschar formation by the end of the first week. Systemic findings, although uncommon, include fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. Life-threatening complications are extremely rare. Treatment consists of cleansing the wound, analgesics for pain, and tetanus prophylaxis. Antimicrobials are indicated if the wound becomes infected. In severe necrotic lesions, tissue debridement may be necessary.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased resting energy expenditure is a typical finding in patients one week after severe thermal injury. Severe burns, as seen in this patient, lead to a hypermetabolic state, which provides energy to the cells involved in wound healing and counters the significant heat and water loss that results from the loss of insulating cutaneous tissue. This postburn hypermetabolic response is characterized by two distinct phases. During the first phase (called the “Ebb phase,” up to 48 hours postburn), cardiac output and metabolism are decreased. The second phase (called the “flow phase”) is characterized by an increase in stress-induced hormones (e.g., catecholamines, glucocorticoids) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α), which lead to a gradual increase in metabolism, cardiac output, and body temperature until reaching a plateau (around one week postburn). Consequences of the hypermetabolic response include hyperglycemia, peripheral insulin resistance, increased muscle protein degradation, increased lipolysis, and significant weight loss.\n\nPostburn hypermetabolism can last up to 2–3 years and is associated with poor long-term results (e.g., immune dysfunction and infections, delayed wound healing). Therapeutic strategies to alter this response include early excision of necrotic tissue and skin grafting, thermoregulation, early enteral feeding with a high-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, glycemic control, beta blockers, anabolic steroids, pain management, and supportive psychotherapy.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "A jellyfish sting in Hawaii that manifests with a characteristic “frosted ladder” appearance is consistent with a sting from an Indo-Pacific box jellyfish (e.g., Chironex fleckeri). Jellyfish have tentacles with specialized capsules (nematocysts) that attach to the patient's skin and release venom. If systemic envenomation cannot be prevented, a box jellyfish sting can result in rapid-onset cardiac arrest.",

        "explanation_why": "Applying topical vinegar for 30 seconds reduces venom discharge from the nematocysts of Australian and Indo-Pacific box jellyfish. Next, any remaining attached tentacles should be carefully pulled off the patient (use gloves if available). Although the rescuer may sustain a minor sting, the latter does not pose a risk to the rescuer; after the removal, the rescuer must rinse the hands with seawater. After topical vinegar application and tentacle removal, topical cold therapy should be applied to alleviate local pain and the patient's transport to the emergency department for observation and definitive care should be arranged. For patients with life-threatening manifestations such as respiratory or cardiac arrest, an antivenom is available.",
        "explanation_but": "The initial approach differs depending on the jellyfish species. Stings by jellyfish outside Australia and the Indo-Pacific region (e.g., Portuguese Physalia species) should not be treated with vinegar as this may stimulate venom discharge or worsen local symptoms. Instead, the tentacles should be directly removed and the sting location must be rinsed with seawater. Next, the affected body part must be immersed in hot water to alleviate local pain. Some research recommends topical application of a 50% baking soda mixture to stings from certain Atlantic jellyfish species (e.g., Cyanea capillata).",

While patients with asbestosis present with dyspnea and chronic cough, chest x-ray typically shows lower lobe involvement and pathognomonic findings of supradiaphragmatic and pleural calcifications. Diagnosis is aided by identification of the golden, beaded appearance of asbestos fibers in sputum, which are coated with iron and ferritin (thus called ferruginous bodies) after being phagocytosed by macrophages. Carbon-laden macrophages are not an expected biopsy finding in asbestosis.",

Furthermore, uranium workers can be exposed to dusts, including silica, which increases the risk for silicosis.

Patients with coal workers' pneumoconiosis present with symptoms of chronic bronchitis, which can progress to severe dyspnea indicating massive pulmonary fibrosis. Inhaled carbon particles accumulate in alveolar macrophages and induce inflammation and fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. Chest x-ray can reveal small, nodular, potentially coalescing opacities in the upper lung lobes. Finally, lung biopsy characteristically shows deposition of dark pigment in macrophages, interstitial tissue, and hilar lymph nodes.\n\nCaplan syndrome is a rare complication of pneumoconiosis, including coal workers' pneumoconiosis, that manifests with rheumatoid arthritis. Although this patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, he does not have Caplan syndrome. If he were to develop this complication, he would likely present with concurrent symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, more rapidly progressive shortness of breath, chest x-ray findings of more peripheral and/or larger nodules, and biopsy findings similar to those seen in rheumatoid nodules (i.e., central fibrinoid necrosis with histiocytes and surrounding epithelial cells).",

She has no allergies, takes no medications, and her immunizations are up-to-date. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 106/68 mm Hg. Examination shows a stinger with the attached venom sac in her right forearm. There is an area of erythema and swelling of approximately 1 cm in diameter at the sting site that is tender to palpation. The physician scrapes off the stinger with a piece of gauze, washes the sting site with soap and water, and applies a cold compress.

        "explanation_why": "Allergic skin testing is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy in patients with a history of a systemic allergic reaction following a Hymenoptera sting. In patients with local skin reactions, there is no indication for allergic skin testing because the probability of developing a systemic life-threatening reaction is low. Moreover, in patients with no history of a systemic allergic reaction, a positive skin test is neither diagnostic nor predicts the risk of developing a systemic reaction following a sting, since more than a quarter of the general population has venom-specific IgE antibodies but only a minority actually reports systemic reactions.",

        "explanation_why": "Uncomplicated local reactions to a Hymenoptera sting only require symptomatic treatment to limit the inflammatory reaction and reduce the pain. The inflammatory reaction to a sting is induced by the venom released from the venom sac of Hymenoptera's stinging apparatus. Since the venom is expelled during the first few minutes after a sting, immediate stinger removal (only applied to Hymenoptera species that lose their stingers after stinging, like honeybees) might limit venom release. Sting removal can be done by scraping off the stinger with a piece of gauze or fingernail but not with tweezers, because of the risk of further squeezing the venom sac. Following removal, the site should be washed with soap and water, cold compresses should be applied, and NSAIDs can be used for pain relief. If present, pruritus can be treated with oral antihistamines or topical steroids. In patients with large local reactions (> 10 cm in diameter), oral steroids can be used.",

He does not have any known allergies. Medical history is remarkable for exercise-induced asthma controlled with a metered-dose albuterol inhaler. He works as a hairdresser and says, “My boss told me yesterday to stop working because the customers are scared it might be contagious.” He lives with a roommate who has not had any similar skin symptoms. He is sexually active with one female partner and uses condoms regularly. Vital signs are within normal limits. Skin examination shows macular erythema, xerosis, and fine, white scaling on the dorsum of the left hand. There are linear fissures in several of the flexural creases of the interphalangeal joints. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Irritants can be chemical (e.g., water, detergents, solvents) and/or physical (e.g., wood, dust, fiberglass); this patient's occupation (hairdressing) increases his risk of developing ICD due to frequent exposure to chemical irritants (e.g., water, shampoos, permanent wave solutions). The manifestations of ICD are typically limited to the area of exposure. This patient's mild pruritus, erythema, scaling, xerosis, and fissuring are characteristic of chronic ICD, which is more common with exposure to weak irritants (e.g., water, soaps, shampoos). Treatment includes avoidance of irritants, moisturizers to restore the epidermal skin barrier, and symptomatic treatment with topical corticosteroids.\n\nICD is caused by a direct cytotoxic effect and is not immune-mediated, as opposed to allergic contact dermatitis, which is a T-cell mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction. To differentiate ICD from allergic contact dermatitis, a patch test for relevant allergens should be performed.",

He is a military diver in training. Four hours before the onset of symptoms, he had taken part in a 3-hour scuba diving exercise to a depth of 30 m (98.4 ft). The dive was uneventful until the patient encountered problems with mask clearing, which led to a rapid ascent. About 1 hour after surfacing, the patient began to feel exceptionally tired and started having headaches. He appears somnolent. Temperature is 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a mottling, reticular skin rash. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left leg and 4/5 in the right leg. Sensation to vibration and light touch is decreased over the lower extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "This patient has decompression sickness (DCS), which typically occurs within 24 hours after scuba diving and can affect the spinal cord (e.g., back pain, paresis and paresthesias of the lower extremities, bladder dysfunction), brain (e.g., headache, altered mental status), and skin (e.g., cutis marmorata).",

        "explanation_why": "In a patient with DCS, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the most appropriate treatment and should be initiated as soon as possible. In a high-pressure environment (e.g., during scuba diving), a large amount of gas (primarily nitrogen) is dissolved in blood and tissue fluid. With a sudden subsequent decrease in pressure (e.g., during rapid ascent), air bubbles form because the gas is no longer dissolved (Henry's law) and they begin to expand (Boyle's law). These bubbles cause local tissue damage and are primarily responsible for the multisystem manifestations of DCS, which can also include chest pain, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia, pruritus, painful lymphadenopathy, and lymphedema. In severe cases, air embolization can also occur. In HBOT, the patient is placed in a high-pressure chamber to decrease the number and volume of any air bubbles that have already formed, and the chamber pressure is then decreased to atmospheric pressure at a slow rate to prevent the formation of new bubbles. While in the chamber, the patient receives 100% oxygen, which creates a gradient for the diffusion of nitrogen out of the body via the lungs.\n\nPatients who do not fully respond to therapy may require multiple sessions until complete resolution or until there is no further improvement. If an HBOT facility is not readily available, the patient should receive 100% oxygen until the patient can be moved to such a facility. Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (for those with lower extremity paralysis) and adequate hydration are also recommended as adjunctive therapy in DCS.",

The position can also decrease the risk of arterial air emboli reaching the cerebral circulation. Although patients with severe DCS can develop venous and arterial air emboli, cerebral edema due to localized tissue damage is a much more common complication of DCS. The Trendelenburg position increases cerebral perfusion and can worsen cerebral edema and is, therefore, no longer recommended for DCS.",

He has been participating in a 5-day hiking trip in which the group has ascended 1500 m (4900 ft) from the base camp in 2 days. This morning, the third day of the trip, the patient was found in his tent unable to respond to simple questions and having wet himself. The night before, he reported headaches, dizziness, and nausea. He appears lethargic. Temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Neurological examination shows slurred speech and an ataxic gait. Kernig sign is absent. Further diagnostic studies cannot be performed due to limited medical equipment. The most appropriate initial step in management is the administration of which of the following?",

He was cleaning out a shed in his backyard when he saw a snake between two beams of wood. When he tried to kill the snake with a shovel, it bit him in the lower leg. He says, “I don't really remember what it looked like other than that it was brown; I had a few beers before I started clearing out the shed, so it's all a bit fuzzy.” The bite site is painful. He is nauseous and says that he feels like he is about to vomit. He has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 96/52 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no other abnormalities. Physical examination shows two erythematous puncture wounds with serous drainage just above the right ankle. There is ecchymosis and swelling across the dorsum of the right foot and the lower leg up to the mid-shin. Active and passive range of motion of the right knee and ankle is limited by pain. Neurologic examination of the extremities shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The majority of snake bites in the US are by Crotalinae species, which are typically earth-toned. Treatment of snake envenomation is determined by the severity of clinical manifestations. This patient presents with systemic features, including nausea, tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypotension, which are consistent with envenomation of moderate severity.",

        "explanation_why": "Administration of antivenom is the most appropriate next step in management of a patient with moderate to severe envenomation by a crotaline snake. The clinical manifestations of envenomation are generally classified into three categories: local tissue effects (e.g., swelling and pain), systemic effects (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, vomiting), and coagulopathic effects (e.g., hemorrhage, abnormal coagulation parameters). Severe cases can result in compartment syndrome, respiratory failure, life-threatening hypotension, and significant bleeding. Antivenom therapy can slow or halt the progression of toxicity and is most effective when administered within 6 hours of the snakebite. Crotalidae polyvalent immune fab and crotalidae immune f(ab')_2 are the antivenoms available in the United States. Patients who have received antivenom should be monitored for hypersensitivity (e.g., serum sickness, anaphylaxis). Additional management recommendations include pain control, local wound care, tetanus immunization, and close observation, including regular monitoring of vital signs, tissue swelling, and coagulation studies.",

        "explanation_why": "Tourniquets and constrictive dressings are generally not recommended after a snakebite. Though constriction may theoretically delay venom spread through lymphatic channels, there is no evidence that this intervention provides any clinical benefit. Moreover, tourniquets can worsen local ischemia and tissue damage. Oral suction and cutting of the wound should also be avoided in the management of snakebite wounds, as their efficacy has not been proven.",

Although this patient presents with limited range of motion of the right knee and ankle due to pain, he has no other symptoms of compartment syndrome. Direct measurement is only indicated in patients with clinical features of increased compartment pressure. Therefore, another step in management is more appropriate at this time.",

This patient, however, has systemic features, including nausea, tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypotension, which are consistent with envenomation of moderate severity.

Though some North American snakes have neurotoxic venom (e.g., coral snakes and some rattlesnakes), this patient does not have any neurologic symptoms, which makes acute neurotoxicity less likely. If he were to develop muscle weakness, upper airway obstruction, or significantly altered mental status, neostigmine administration and intubation might be indicated.

These glycoproteins are not inhibited by the action of heparin, which plays no role in the management of crotaline envenomation and may increase the risk of bleeding.",

        "explanation_why": "Allergic asthma, the most common type of asthma, is an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction to specific allergens and is commonly associated with other atopic conditions such as allergic rhinitis. The most frequently implicated allergens include pollen, dust mites, mold, and animal dander. Pollen-induced allergies are typically seasonal, whereas allergies caused by indoor exposure to dust mites, mold, or animal dander are usually perennial and linked to repeated exposure at home, school, or the workplace. Certain species of mold are associated with an increased risk of allergic asthma (e.g., Aspergillus), and exposure to mold spores typically occurs in damp environments (e.g., due to a water leak). Occasionally, especially in colder regions of the U.S., mold-induced allergies may display a seasonal pattern because mold growth increases during periods of heightened moisture. Management of allergic asthma involves stepwise asthma treatment and avoidance of environmental triggers.",

HP is often a result of occupational exposure to these antigens and is a notifiable occupational disease. HP can be acute, manifesting within 12 hours of exposure with flu-like symptoms, dyspnea, and chest tightness; or chronic, manifesting after weeks to years of exposure with progressive dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and weight loss. The diagnosis of HP is based on a history of antigen exposure, typical clinical and radiological features, and supportive diagnostic studies. PFTs typically show findings of ILD.\n\nA high-resolution CT should be obtained in all patients to classify HP as fibrotic or nonfibrotic, which impacts further workup, treatment, and prognosis. The cornerstone of HP management is antigen avoidance.",

Imaging is not routinely recommended for allergic asthma, but chest x-rays are usually normal or may show pulmonary hyperinflation and bronchial wall thickening.
