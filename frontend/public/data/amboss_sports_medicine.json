The patient describes the pain as a dull ache most notable during his daily training routine. The pain used to dissipate while training but now resolves slowly with rest. The pain does not occur with his daily nonexertional activities, including walking. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination reveals diffuse tenderness along the medial border of the distal lower extremities. There is no lower extremity warmth, swelling, or overlying skin changes. Muscle strength in the lower extremities is normal. Pedal pulses are intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) may occur in young, active individuals and manifests with lower extremity claudication pain. Pedal pulses are usually normal at rest and decrease only during provocative maneuvers like ankle plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. However, this patient reports that his pain initially dissipated while training, which is inconsistent with PAES. Additionally, PAES is rare and is more likely to be unilateral than bilateral.",

In CECS, the pain always worsens with continued activity (due to increased intracompartmental pressure), but this patient reports that his pain initially dissipated while training. Additionally, the pain in CECS usually resolves quickly after cessation of the activity. CECS does not result in abnormal findings at rest, whereas this patient has lower extremity tenderness at rest.",

        "explanation_why": "Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is characterized by lower extremity pain and typically occurs in individuals who have recently increased their physical activity levels. MTSS typically manifests with a bilateral dull ache that arises during intense physical activity. The pain may initially dissipate during continued exercise but gradually worsens over time, eventually requiring rest for relief. Physical examination usually reveals diffuse tenderness along the medial border of the tibia without associated warmth, swelling, or skin changes. Muscle strength in the lower extremities remains normal, and the condition generally does not interfere with nonexertional daily activities like walking. The diagnosis is clinical, and management of MTSS includes applying the POLICE principle and reducing the patient's overall running mileage.",

        "explanation_why": "A tibial stress fracture is caused by a rapid change in physical training (particularly increasing running distance) and often occurs in military recruits. However, tibial stress fractures typically manifest with point tenderness directly over the fracture site, unlike the diffuse tenderness along the medial border of the distal lower extremities in this patient. Moreover, tibial stress fractures often cause pain that is exacerbated by weight-bearing and may persist even at rest or while walking.",

The pain radiates to the right knee and intensifies during physical activity, such as soccer practice. He is otherwise healthy and has reached all developmental milestones for his age. He was delivered vaginally in a breech position. Family history is unremarkable. He does not take any medications, and his vaccinations are up-to-date. He is 130 cm (4 ft 3 in) (25^th percentile) and weighs 23 kg (51 lb) (15^th percentile). His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 105/70mm Hg. Physical examination shows pain in the right hip on internal rotation. Range of motion of the hip and knee is normal. A pelvic x-ray shows joint space widening of the right hip. Which of the following factors in this patient most strongly predicts a poor prognosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Although some studies identify breech delivery as a risk factor for LCPD, there is no evidence that it has prognostic significance for this condition.\n\nBreech delivery increases the risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip, which can manifest with hip pain that radiates to the knee. However, this symptom and other features (e.g., limited range of motion, leg length discrepancy, Trendelenburg gait) typically appear much earlier because hip damage occurs by the age of 2–3 years if the condition is not detected and treated during infancy.",

        "explanation_why": "Older age at onset (> 8 years) of LCPD is associated with a poor prognosis, likely due to the decreased ability of the acetabulum to adapt to the deformed femoral head. Other important factors that predict a poor prognosis include female sex, limited range of motion (especially abduction), and extensive femoral head damage or lateral pillar involvement. Surgical treatment is considered in patients with advanced disease or multiple factors for a poor prognosis. The primary goal of treatment is to keep the femoral head contained within the acetabulum.",
