It also renders sperm immotile, which reduces fertility, and can cause dextrocardia (because cilia are responsible for the position of internal organs during embryological development). Other clinical features of PCD include chronic otitis media and conductive hearing loss.

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "The triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia suggests Wernicke encephalopathy, which is due to deficiency of thiamine (most commonly seen in patients with alcohol use disorder). Decreased activity of the enzyme erythrocyte transketolase, which uses thiamine as a cofactor, is diagnostic of Wernicke encephalopathy.",

        "explanation_why": "Cobalamin (vitamin B_12) serves as a cofactor in enzymatic reactions responsible for red blood cell formation and myelination of the nervous system. Deficiency is seen in malnourished patients (e.g., due to chronic alcoholism) and manifests with chronic neurologic symptoms, including gait abnormalities. However, supplementation of cobalamin would improve symptoms, not worsen them. Moreover, cobalamin is not known to precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy. Other features of cobalamin deficiency include macrocytic anemia, mild icterus, and glossitis, as well as symmetric peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, and neuropsychiatric disease.",

        "explanation_why": "The active form of thiamine, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), serves as a cofactor for dehydrogenases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, both enzymes that are essential for ATP generation. Thiamine deficiency (e.g., due to malnutrition or chronic heavy drinking) leads to ATP depletion, which primarily damages highly aerobic tissues such as CNS neurons. Infusing glucose in a patient with thiamine deficiency without administering thiamine beforehand precipitates Wernicke encephalopathy. The presence of glucose drives glycolysis, which leads to the production of pyruvate, and the lack of thiamine results in an impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The pyruvate cannot be metabolized into acetyl-CoA and enter the citric acid cycle, so the excess pyruvate is instead reduced into cytotoxic amounts of lactate. In addition, as a cofactor for the transketolase reaction of the NADPH-producing pentose phosphate pathway, TPP is also essential for the regeneration of the antioxidant glutathione. Decreased glutathione regeneration due to thiamine deficiency impairs free radical neutralization, causing further cell damage.",

Anemia can cause tachycardia, which is seen in this patient, but pallor rather than cyanosis would be expected. Moreover, chocolate-colored blood that does not change color when exposed to oxygen is not seen in anemia.",

        "explanation_why": "Methemoglobinemia is caused by an abundance of methemoglobin, an altered form of hemoglobin in which ferrous iron (Fe^2+) is oxidized to the ferric form (Fe^3+). Since Fe^3+ cannot bind oxygen, arterial O_2 saturation and total O_2 content decrease. This leads to functional anemia, despite normal hemoglobin concentrations. Patients with methemoglobinemia show clinical signs of cyanosis due to poor tissue oxygenation. O_2 partial pressure (PaO_2), which reflects the concentration of dissolved oxygen in plasma, is not affected. In patients prone to developing methemoglobinemia (e.g., patients with G6PD deficiency), oxidant drugs such as dapsone and topical anesthetic drugs should be avoided. Treatment consists of converting methemoglobin to hemoglobin by using reducing agents such as methylene blue and vitamin C.\n\nAlthough prolonged or chronic methemoglobinemia may lead to erythrocytosis or polycythemia, this patient has only been taking her medication for three days.\n\nSee “Overview of factors that affect oxygenation” table.",

        "explanation_why": "These arterial blood gas findings are consistent with hypoxemia (e.g., due to impaired gas exchange in the lungs). Impaired oxygenation of the blood decreases both the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma (↓ PaO_2) and the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin (↓ SaO_2). As a result, the total amount of oxygen transported by arterial blood (i.e., O_2 content) will also be reduced. In states of hypoxemia, the hemoglobin concentration is initially unaffected, but may eventually increase due to stimulation of erythropoietin secretion. Hypoxemia can cause signs of cyanosis, which are seen here. However, unlike this patient's blood sample, deoxygenated blood changes color to bright red upon exposure to oxygen.",

        "explanation_why": "These arterial blood gas findings are consistent with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning (e.g., from cigarette smoke). Since carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin (Hb) with much higher affinity than oxygen (producing carboxyhemoglobin), it cannot easily be displaced. This results in a left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, which impairs oxygen delivery to the tissues. The amount of oxygen bound to Hb (SaO_2) as well as the total arterial O_2 content are reduced, while the amount of dissolved oxygen in the plasma (PaO_2) remains unaffected. Elevated erythropoietin production secondary to chronic hypoxia induces an increase in Hb. Clinical findings of chronic carbon monoxide include dizziness and seizures, neither of which is seen here. Moreover, based on this patient's history, there is no reason to expect prolonged exposure to CO.",

Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow papules on the tip of the tongue. There is a 2-cm, firm thyroid nodule. He has long and slender upper extremities, and his elbows and knees can be hyperextended. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is a mutation in which of the following genes?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This man's paroxysmal headaches, palpitations, sweating, and hypertension are concerning for a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. His long upper extremities and joint laxity are features of Marfanoid habitus. Together with the firm thyroid nodule (possibly thyroid cancer) and the soft, yellow papules on the tongue (likely mucosal neuromas), these findings raise suspicion for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B).",

        "explanation_why": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, which includes MEN 2A and MEN 2B, results from a gain-of-function mutation of the RET gene. RET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a key role in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Medullary thyroid cancer (which develops in almost all patients) and pheochromocytoma are associated with both MEN 2A and MEN 2B. MEN 2A is associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, and MEN 2B is associated with marfanoid habitus and mucosal neuromas.\n\nEarly diagnosis of MEN 2-associated medullary thyroid cancer is essential because this malignancy is highly aggressive. High-risk patients identified by genetic screening should undergo thyroidectomy during the first year of life.",

Because kallikrein normally converts kininogen to bradykinin, increased levels of kallikrein lead to a buildup of bradykinin, with resultant vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and eventual angioedema. First-line therapies for HAE focus on antagonizing the bradykinin B2 receptor (icatibant), replacing the defective enzyme with intravenous injection of purified C1-INH, or preventing further generation of bradykinin with a kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide).\n\nTrauma, dental work, and mental or physical stress are common triggers for these acute attacks.",

This patient presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, tachypnea, fruity breath, features of dehydration due to osmotic diuresis (hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor), and altered mental status combined with glucose levels 200–600 mg/dL, which indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common complication of T1DM.",

        "explanation_why": "The insulin-deficient state of DKA leads to increased lipolysis, resulting in more free fatty acids. Metabolic acidosis develops as these free fatty acids become ketones, two of which are acidic (acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid), resulting in consumption of serum bicarbonate, which acts as a buffer for the acidic ketones. The primary goal of treatment with insulin and intravenous fluids is to stop ketogenesis and allow the body to metabolize the existing ketoacids, thereby correcting acidosis. As the condition resolves, the concentration of ketoacids in the blood decreases, leading to a rise in the pH. The key criteria for resolution of DKA are glucose < 200mg/dL, serum bicarbonate ≥ 18 mEq/L, and an increase in venous PH to ≥ 7.30.",

Insulin deficiency and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state cause potassium to shift to the extracellular space along with water from inside cells, which is then lost in urine. Treatment with IV fluids and insulin causes potassium to move back into the cells, decreasing rather than increasing serum potassium.

His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. His fingers are long and slender, and his arm span exceeds his body height. Electrocardiography shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2. His serum troponin I concentration is 2.0 ng/mL. Coronary angiography shows 90% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

Individuals with this sex chromosome disorder typically have a tall stature with long extremities and may present with a learning disability. However, Klinefelter syndrome is not associated with arachnodactyly, early-onset coronary heart disease, or thromboembolic events. Instead, symptoms related to testosterone deficiency (e.g., testicular hypoplasia, reduced body hair, osteoporosis) would be expected.",

Other clinical features may include myopia, pale skin, osteoporosis, and kyphosis. This condition is caused by several enzyme defects (e.g., cystathionine synthase deficiency, methionine synthase deficiency, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency), all of which result in the accumulation of homocysteine. Treatment depends on the underlying defect (e.g., cysteine, vitamin B_6, vitamin B_12, folate supplementation).\n\nMarfan syndrome is an important differential diagnosis of homocystinuria. Distinguishing features include intellectual disability, which is only seen in homocystinuria, and the direction of lens dislocation (downwards in homocystinuria; upwards in Marfan syndrome).",

        "explanation_why": "Nitrates (e.g., sublingual nitroglycerin) and PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., vardenafil) both work by increasing the intracellular concentration of cGMP. Nitrates increase intracellular NO, which is responsible for activating guanylate cyclase in the cytosol of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to increased synthesis of cGMP. PDE-5 inhibitors, as their name implies, inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE), which leads to a decreased breakdown of cGMP. Accumulation of cGMP leads to activation of myosin-light-chain phosphatase (MLCP), which dephosphorylates the light chains of myosin. This results in smooth muscle cell relaxation in blood vessels with subsequent vasodilation. Life-threatening hypotension can occur if these two drugs are taken in combination.",

Hypercalcemia (e.g., due to milk-alkali syndrome) inhibits PTH secretion, which is why PTH levels would most likely be decreased (not increased) in this patient. Hypercalcemia in combination with increased PTH levels is seen in primary hyperparathyroidism (e.g., due to parathyroid gland adenomas).",

There is no history of starvation or alcohol use in this patient. DKA is seen primarily in patients with type I diabetes mellitus, as opposed to type II diabetes mellitus.

Since calcitriol normally increases serum calcium concentrations (via effects on the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys), decreased formation of calcitriol results in a reduction in serum calcium concentrations.",

Treatment for arsenic poisoning includes chelation therapy, cardiac monitoring (because of the risk of QTc prolongation), and fluid administration (to encourage urine output). Dimercaprol chelates several heavy metals, including arsenic, to form more stable, nontoxic, soluble compounds that are then excreted in the urine.\n\nIn cases of recent arsenic ingestion (within an hour), additional therapies include gastric lavage and activated charcoal (to absorb arsenic in the gastrointestinal tract). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer) is more commonly used as chelation therapy for arsenic poisoning in children.",

        "explanation_why": "Chronic use of topical corticosteroids causes dermal collagen loss, which manifests as skin atrophy (skin thinning) and stretch marks. Skin thinning is the most common side effect of topical corticosteroid use and often causes the skin to appear translucent, making any underlying vasculature more visible. Longer duration of use, treatment with higher-strength corticosteroids (e.g., clobetasol), and use under occlusion increase the risk of adverse effects. Patients should receive directions on when to stop topical corticosteroid therapy to prevent this adverse effect.\n\nCorticosteroids bind to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, forming a complex that translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with specific DNA sequences. The complex activates IκB, which inhibits the function of NF-κB, a transcription factor that normally promotes expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. It also inhibits production of arachidonic acid derivatives by inhibiting phospholipase A_2.",

Moreover, the alkalotic environment results in increased activity of cellular K^+/H^+ antiporter, which moves H^+ ions extracellularly to correct the alkalosis. In exchange, K^+ ions are being moved intracellularly, creating a state of relative hypokalemia.",

Anion gaps are formed by the presence of unmeasured anions (i.e., anions other than Cl^- and HCO3^‑), such as ketones. The elevated serum K^+ often seen with metabolic acidosis occurs due to extracellular K^+ shifts in response to H^+ being moved intracellularly (via K^+/H^+ antiporter).

    "hint": "Intestinal and renal loss of neutral amino acids (e.g., tryptophan) is characteristic of Hartnup disease. Because tryptophan is a precursor of endogenous synthesis of vitamin B3, its loss results in vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency and symptoms of pellagra (rash on sun-exposed skin, ataxia with clumsiness, and recurrent falls).",

In Hartnup disease, patients are vitamin B3 (niacin) deficient and do not require vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D deficiency occurs in patients with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (D, E, A, and K) rather than neutral amino acids. In children, this deficiency causes rickets.",

One of the most prominent side effects of niacin is facial flushing due to an increase in prostaglandin synthesis (leads to cutaneous vasodilation). Aspirin or ibuprofen, taken 30–60 minutes prior to administration of niacin, helps suppress prostaglandin production by inactivating cyclooxygenase.\n\nOther adverse effects of niacin include hyperglycemia and hyperuricemia.",

A mutation in KRAS results in unregulated cellular signaling and cellular proliferation, leading to the formation of an adenoma. Loss of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and DCC results in the malignant transformation of an adenoma to carcinoma. The chromosomal instability pathway is responsible for carcinomas in FAP (loss of APC) as well as in most cases of sporadic colorectal carcinoma.Bottom: Microsatellite instability pathway\n- Acquired or inherited mutations in the mismatch repair genes (esp.

    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "Watery diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, episodic cutaneous flushing triggered by eating or emotional events, asthma-like attacks, and a murmur indicative of tricuspid regurgitation are highly suggestive of carcinoid syndrome.

        "explanation_why": "Increased gastric pH levels are not associated with carcinoid syndrome but are seen in achlorhydria, which is a key feature of WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria) seen in VIPomas. The unregulated production of VIP leads to excessive secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. Cutaneous flushing is seen in about 20% of patients with VIPoma. However, abdominal pain is usually mild or absent. Furthermore, this etiology does not explain why the patient also presents with a tricuspid murmur and asthma, neither of which are typical findings of VIPomas.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Dermatitis is a characteristic feature of pellagra, or niacin deficiency; other key findings include dementia and diarrhea (i.e., the “three Ds”). Dermatitis in patients with pellagra is characterized by a symmetrical, pigmented, scaly thickening of the skin in sun-exposed areas, such as the limbs and around the neck (casal necklace). The increased metabolism of serotonin in neuroendocrine neoplasms depletes the amount of tryptophan precursors available for other organic compounds, including niacin. A lack of niacin leads to decreased production of the coenzymes NAD+ and NADP+, which are essential in redox reactions throughout cellular metabolism. Diagnosis is confirmed via 24-hour urine testing for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the end product of serotonin metabolism.\n\nIn developed countries, pellagra is most commonly seen in patients with alcohol use disorder or as a complication of malabsorption. It can also occur in Hartnup disease (due to renal and intestinal loss of tryptophan) or after prolonged use of isoniazid (due to decreased levels of vitamin B6, which is essential for the production of niacin).",

Specific causes for folate deficiency include the use of folate antagonists, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency is seen in pernicious anemia or after gastrectomy. Although malabsorption can occur in carcinoid syndrome, it is usually not severe enough to cause folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. Another complication is more likely to affect this patient.",

Carcinoid heart disease typically develops as a result of chronic exposure of the heart to serotonin from liver metastases.

Sporadic retinoblastomas, on the other hand, are caused by two spontaneous mutations in the same retinal cell, affecting both Rb alleles.\n\nAll children who present with leukocoria should be considered to have retinoblastoma until proven otherwise and should undergo prompt fundus examination.

An X-linked defect in type IV collagen is responsible for most cases of Alport's syndrome, which results in progressive sensorineural hearing loss (with high-frequency sounds affected first) and hematuria. Episodes of gross hematuria are sometimes preceded by upper respiratory tract infections. Patients with Alport's syndrome also commonly develop an anterior lenticonus since type IV collagen is the predominant collagen fiber in the lens capsule.

Patients with this condition have chronic joint disease of the weight-bearing joints and morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes. While tumor lysis syndrome can lead to deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in the kidneys (predisposing to acute kidney injury), deposition of these crystals in the joints is not a sequela of tumor lysis syndrome.",

High-dose all-trans retinoic acid activates the mutated receptor and thereby restores maturation of otherwise malignant granulocytes.\n\nSome subtypes of AML (especially M3) exhibit characteristic Auer rods, which are pinkish-red, rod-shaped granular components within the cytoplasm.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, the physiological substrate for 21-hydroxylase, confirm the diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This enzyme deficiency is the most common cause of CAH and results in decreased synthesis of mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone) and glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisone). Hypoaldosteronism causes hypotension and hyperkalemia and hypocortisolism leads to an increase in the secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland. Stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH results in adrenal hyperplasia and increased production of adrenal androgens from steroid precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone, thereby causing virilization in female individuals.",

However, 11β-hydroxylase deficiency typically manifests with hypertension and hypokalemia rather than hypotension and hyperkalemia. In addition, 11-deoxycorticosterone is synthesized by 21-hydroxylase from progesterone in the aldosterone synthesis pathway and would thus be decreased, not increased, in this patient.",

These patients also present with hypocortisolism and hypoaldosteronism, but are typically hypertensive and have hypoandrogenism. Unlike this patient's condition, 17α-hydroxylase deficiency causes hypokalemia, and affected girls have normal external genitalia at birth, but delayed or absent puberty later in life. Although an increase in aldosterone would be expected in 17α-hydroxylase deficiency, high levels of DOC (which has aldosterone-like activity) inhibit renin and therefore aldosterone production. Hypertension occurs despite hypoaldosteronism because DOC possesses mineralocorticoid activity.",

His laboratory studies are notable for an elevated anion gap AG = 137 - (99 + 8) = 30 and an elevated osmolar gap (32 mOsmol/kg H_2O).

These metabolites collect in the renal system and are detectable in the urine as oxalate crystals, which can cause flank pain, hematuria, oliguria, and acute kidney injury. Hypocalcemia, the cause of this patient's tetany, is a result of calcium being consumed by oxalate to form calcium oxalate. Other signs of ethylene glycol poisoning include altered mental status and tachypnea (due to respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis). Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning consists of fomepizole to competitively inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase, as ethylene glycol itself is not nearly as toxic as its metabolites.",

Acetyl-CoA is used for allosteric modulation of pyruvate carboxylase (to promote gluconeogenesis), ATP generation (in Krebs cycle), or ketone body formation. When glucose and glycogen stores are depleted, for example, after this patient's fasting (e.g., during weaning, skipping nightly feeds) or a state of increased metabolic demand (e.g., infection, exercise), the body normally relies on fatty acid metabolism. But in patients with MCAD deficiency, a deficit of acetyl-CoA develops, which leads to hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia without ketosis, vomiting, and lethargy, as seen in this patient. Without intervention, the condition can progress to seizure and coma.\n\nMedium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is routinely screened in neonates. To prevent symptoms, patients are advised to adopt a diet consisting of frequent high-carbohydrate and low-fat meals and avoid fasting or metabolic decompensation.",

Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) can lead to bruising and immunosuppression, the latter of which is consistent with this patient's 3-month history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. However, immunosuppression is not specific to scurvy and this patient does not have other dermatological manifestations of scurvy such as perifollicular hemorrhages, petechiae, and corkscrew hairs. Her history of frequent stumbling at night and triangular keratin plaques on the conjunctiva suggest a different deficiency.",

Because vitamin A is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and retinal pigmentation, retinol deficiency results in dermatological and ophthalmological manifestations, such as xerosis cutis and Bitot spots. A deficiency in vitamin A can also cause immunosuppression, which explains this patient's recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.

Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show hypercalciuria and decreased urine pH; serum calcium and uric acid would be expected to be normal. Other risk factors for the development of calcium oxalate stones include Crohn disease, ethylene glycol toxicity, hypocitraturia, and vitamin C toxicity.",

Alkaline urine is typically seen in patients with UTIs caused by urease-producing organisms, which convert urea to the basic compound ammonia. Ammonia combines with water to form ammonium, which under basic conditions combines with phosphate and magnesium to form struvite stones. Struvite stones are rare and only account for 5–10% of all kidney stones. This patient lacks a history of recurrent UTI or indwelling urinary catheter and therefore is unlikely to have struvite stones.",

When there is increased stool fat content, calcium, which normally chelates free oxalate, binds free lipids instead. More free oxalate is absorbed, which promotes the formation of renal calcium oxalate stones. Oxalate stones are envelope-shaped and do not cause a positive urine sodium cyanide nitroprusside test, unlike what is seen in this case. In addition, this patient's young age and lack of fitting history rule out Crohn disease and short bowel syndrome.",

Which of the following best explains this patient's laboratory finding?",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "Warfarin is a competitive antagonist of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase, which reduces vitamin K. Reduced vitamin K is required for the activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Decreased activation of these clotting factors is responsible for the prolongation of INR that occurs with warfarin.",

        "explanation_why": "Gut bacteria produce about half of the vitamin K required by the body. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., macrolides) can deplete vitamin K stores in the body by destroying gut flora. Since vitamin K competes with warfarin for binding to the active site of vitamin K epoxide reductase, depletion of vitamin K would augment the effects of warfarin and further increase INR.\n\nNewborns have low vitamin K levels due to a lack of gut colonization by vitamin K-producing bacteria and are therefore at increased risk for bleeding. Newborns receive an intramuscular vitamin K shot at birth to mitigate this risk.",

Moreover, while certain macrolides (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) inhibit cytochrome p450 enzymes, azithromycin uniquely does not affect p450 enzyme activity.",

Other highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., aspirin and sulfa drugs) can compete with warfarin and further displace it from albumin binding sites; this leads to higher levels of unbound (effective) warfarin and a subsequent increase in INR. Azithromycin, however, is not a highly protein-bound drug.",

When there is heteroplasmy in the parental cell (P), levels of heteroplasmy can increase, decrease, or stay the same in subsequent filial generations (F1, F2), resulting in variable disease expression. Severity often correlates with the proportion of mutated mtDNA. In some conditions, the disease phenotype is only expressed once the proportion of mutated mtDNA is above a certain threshold.",

However, unlike this patient's bipyramidal, envelope-shaped crystals, uric acid stones appear on urine microscopy as rhomboid-shaped crystals. In addition, this patient takes allopurinol, a medication that reduces uric acid production. A history of taking large amounts of a multivitamin supplement increases the risk of nephrolithiasis from the toxicity of a different substance.",

    "hint": "This young patient has evidence of chronically elevated serum glucose concentrations (HbA_1C of 7.1%) and inappropriate release of insulin in response to an oral glucose challenge.

The defect causes an increase in the glucose threshold required to promote insulin secretion. MODY type II is managed with dietary modifications only, as medical treatment fails to lower glucose and HbA1c. In contrast to other subtypes of MODY, patients with MODY type II are not at risk for micro- or macrovascular complications, despite mild fasting hyperglycemia and chronically elevated HbA1c.",

            "description": "Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) acts by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), resulting in selective inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.Azathioprine (AZA) is a purine analog that is converted, first, to 6-mercaptopurine and, then, into thioinosine monophosphate (TIM), a cytotoxic agent, which acts to block nucleotide synthesis and inhibit lymphocyte proliferation.Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist (antimetabolite), which acts primarily by inhibiting the clonal expansion of B and T cells.Cyclophosphamide causes alkylation of DNA/RNA, resulting in impaired DNA cross-linking and DNA synthesis.Basiliximab/daclizumab inhibits the alpha chain (CD25 antigen) of the IL-2 receptor of T cells, resulting in a reduction of T-cell responses and the expansion of natural killer cells.Sirolimus/everolimus inhibits mTOR kinase resulting in the inhibition of the IL-2-mediated cell cycle. This leads to reduced T-cell activation and B-cell differentiation, resulting in decreased IgM, IgG, and IgA production.Tacrolimus (FK 506) and pimecrolimus bind to the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) resulting in inhibition of calcineurin, an enzyme necessary for the activation of NFAT. This leads to reduced gene transcription and activation of T cells. Cyclosporine A binds cyclophilin, which also inhibits calcineurin.Glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) directly inhibit intracellular NF-κB, a protein complex responsible for transcription of DNA, cytokine production, and cell survival.",

TNF-α inhibitors can improve spine mobility and reduce pain in patients with AS. However, the pro-inflammatory action of TNF-α also plays a key role in granuloma formation and containment of tuberculosis. Inhibition of TNF-α could disrupt the granulomas, thereby releasing intracellular mycobacteria and reactivating latent tuberculosis. Thus, TNF-α inhibitors are contraindicated in individuals with latent tuberculosis, necessitating routine screening tests before initiation of treatment in all individuals.",

This leads to reduced T-cell activation and B-cell differentiation, resulting in decreased IgM, IgG, and IgA production.Tacrolimus (FK 506) and pimecrolimus bind to the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) resulting in inhibition of calcineurin, an enzyme necessary for the activation of NFAT. This leads to reduced gene transcription and activation of T cells. Cyclosporine A binds cyclophilin, which also inhibits calcineurin.Glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) directly inhibit intracellular NF-κB, a protein complex responsible for transcription of DNA, cytokine production, and cell survival.",

SCID typically causes more severe infections than those seen in this patient, and it is usually lethal within the first year of life if not diagnosed and treated immediately. Diagnostic criteria for SCID include decreased T-cell receptor excision circles and absent T cells on peripheral blood flow cytometry, but a deficiency of mature B cells would not be expected.",

Although recurrent infections are a feature of many immunodeficiency disorders, tonsillar hypoplasia (due to low B-cell volume), as seen in this patient, is especially suggestive of XLA.\n\nThe diagnosis of XLA is confirmed by flow cytometry that shows reduced levels of B cells (marked by CD19, CD20, and CD21) and normal levels of T cells.

        "explanation_why": "An increased stool pH would not be expected in this patient, as those with lactose malabsorption present with acidic stool (pH < 6). Lactose reaches the large intestine due to insufficient hydrolysis by lactase. There, it serves as a fermentation substrate for colonic bacterial flora. Hydrogen and fatty acids are generated during fermentation, resulting in a decreased stool pH.",

Diminished absorption (e.g., in the setting of celiac disease, which can underlie lactose intolerance) would lead to decreased urinary D-xylose levels.

The remaining contribution to stool osmolality (i.e., the stool osmotic gap) depends on nonelectrolyte substances. In individuals with lactose malabsorption, unabsorbed lactose and its fermented metabolites contribute significantly to stool osmolality, meaning an increased stool osmotic gap.\n\nAn increased stool osmotic gap is not specific to lactose intolerance and occurs in all forms of osmotic diarrhea (e.g., laxative abuse).",

This deletion leads to a misfolded CFTR protein that is unable to reach the cellular membrane. The CFTR protein is an important chloride channel in cell membranes, and when mutated cannot properly secrete intracellular chloride ions. This mutation causes exocrine glands to produce hyperviscous secretions that accumulate and damage different organs, mainly the lungs and pancreas.",

Chloride and sodium are normally in equilibrium, but the accumulation of intracellular chloride due to the absence of a transporter results in the retention of intracellular sodium and water (due to osmosis). This ultimately results in hyperviscous mucus, which causes blockages of small organs and airways, inflammation, and end-organ damage.",

Carbamoyl phosphate then enters the urea cycle by reacting with ornithine to form citrulline. Citrulline is transported via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter into the cytosol. In an ATP-dependent reaction, argininosuccinate synthase condenses citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate. Next, argininosuccinate is cleaved into fumarate and arginine, which in turn is cleaved by arginase into urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transported back into the mitochondrion via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter and thus becomes available for reacting with carbamoyl phosphate in a new cycle. Urea is excreted via the kidneys.",

Although rasburicase could theoretically be used to treat hyperuricemia secondary to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, the paucity of clinical data supporting its efficacy makes it a less appropriate option. In addition, a drug that inhibits the conversion of urate to allantoin would decrease uric acid excretion and worsen this patient's hyperuricemia.",

Accumulation of deoxyadenosine due to adenosine deaminase deficiency results in lymphocyte toxicity and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is not associated with delayed motor skills, self-mutilating behavior, or hyperuricemia. Rather, features of SCID include severe recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and fatality in the first year of life if left untreated, none of which are seen in this patient. Furthermore, there are currently no clinically-approved adenosine deaminase inhibitors and inhibition of the already deficient enzyme would worsen the disease.",

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a congenital deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), a purine salvage enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanine monophosphate. HGPRT deficiency results in the accumulation of hypoxanthine and guanine, both of which are converted to xanthine and subsequently uric acid.",

            "description": "Acute gout attack: Increases in uric acid concentration or decreases in temperature/pH can lead to the accumulation of urate crystals in various tissues, triggering inflammation. First-line treatment options include NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and colchicine.Purine metabolism: Uric acid concentration can increase due to underexcretion (e.g., in chronic renal insufficiency) or over-production (e.g., in tumor lysis syndrome or high dietary purine intake). Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol) inhibit the purine degradation pathway from hypoxanthine to uric acid. Uricosuric medications (e.g., probenecid) inhibit uric acid reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules, thus increasing renal excretion. Pegloticase (a recombinant uricase) catalyzes the breakdown of uric acid into allantoin, which is more water-soluble and, therefore, more readily excreted renally.",

His hemoglobin concentration is 11.9 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 89/μm^3, and serum lactate dehydrogenase is 215 U/L. His serum haptoglobin is slightly decreased. A deficiency of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",

        "explanation_why": "Deficiency of tocopherol (vitamin E deficiency) classically manifests with hemolytic anemia and symptoms of posterior column and spinocerebellar tract dysfunction (ataxia, loss of proprioception, and diminished reflexes). It is an uncommon condition in developed countries, but specific populations, such as patients with fat malabsorption disorders (e.g., chronic pancreatitis, abetalipoproteinemia, cystic fibrosis) are at significant risk. Vitamin E deficiency is harmful to neurons and red blood cells specifically as they are particularly sensitive to the oxidative damage that results from the loss of vitamin E antioxidative effects.",

Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency or decreased affinity of the enzyme for vitamin B6 can be treated with B6 supplementation. However, only about 50% of patients are pyridoxine-responsive. Because cystathionine synthase deficiency results in the accumulation of thrombogenic homocysteine, it predisposes to thromboembolic events (e.g., acute stroke). Lowering the plasma homocysteine concentration is therefore the single most important factor for reducing the risk of vascular events.",

    "hint": "This patient's seizure, speech and motor delays, and elevated urine phenylacetate are indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU). His family history of severe intellectual disability, the hallmark of untreated PKU, is consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of this condition.",

Phenylalanine hydroxylase normally converts phenylalanine into tyrosine, but this enzyme is lacking in classic phenylketonuria. The seizure seen in this patient was caused by insufficient tyrosine, which is necessary for neurotransmitter and thyroxine production. Tyrosine is also required for melanin production, explaining the light skin characteristic of PKU. Other symptoms include a musty body odor, failure to thrive, loss of motor control, and mental disabilities.",

Symptoms usually develop after the neonatal period and include developmental delay and seizures (due to phenylalanine accumulation in the CNS), hypopigmentation (due to a lack of melanin production from low levels of tyrosine), and eczema, all of which are present in this case. In addition, PKU manifests with a characteristic mousy or musty odor due to excretion of phenylalanine metabolites in the urine and sweat. PKU is typically detected by newborn screening for metabolic disorders.",

        "explanation_why": "N-acetylglutamate increases the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1), a mitochondrial enzyme that converts bicarbonate and ammonia to carbamoyl phosphate using 2 molecules of ATP. This process is the rate-limiting step of the urea cycle. N-acetylglutamate is synthesized primarily in the liver and small intestinal cells when the cellular concentration of arginine is increased. In this way, the activity of CPS1 is increased following a protein-rich meal, when ammonia production is expected to be increased.\n\nThe two most common hereditary defects in the urea cycle are ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC deficiency) and CPS1 deficiency. Neonates with either of these defects are usually normal at birth but present with vomiting, lethargy, hyperventilation, and cerebral edema (due to intracellular accumulation of glutamine) after the first 24–72 hours as a result of introduction of dietary protein. In addition to increased ammonia levels in blood, they have increased glutamine and decreased blood urea nitrogen. OTC deficiency can be differentiated from CPS1 deficiency by the presence of orotic acid in urine.",

            "description": "The urea cycle is a metabolic pathway specific to the liver that converts cytotoxic ammonia into urea for excretion.In the mitochondrion, ammonia and bicarbonate react to form carbamoyl phosphate, catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthase and requires two ATP molecules. Carbamoyl phosphate then enters the urea cycle by reacting with ornithine to form citrulline. Citrulline is transported via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter into the cytosol. In an ATP-dependent reaction, argininosuccinate synthase condenses citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate. Next, argininosuccinate is cleaved into fumarate and arginine, which in turn is cleaved by arginase into urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transported back into the mitochondrion via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter and thus becomes available for reacting with carbamoyl phosphate in a new cycle. Urea is excreted via the kidneys.",

As an acute-phase reactant, it mediates anemia of chronic disease in patients with chronic inflammation. Deficiency of hepcidin is thought to cause hemochromatosis, resulting in primary iron overload. Hepcidin levels have also been shown to be suppressed or not detectable in patients with thalassemia, showing that secondary iron overload in this condition is not only due to frequent blood transfusions but also results from increased iron absorption in the intestine.",

In addition, newborns have sterile intestines, and the establishment of gut microflora that synthesizes vitamin K takes approximately 6 months. As vitamin K is necessary for the production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, not supplementing it within a few hours after birth can enable a potentially fatal hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Another risk factor for vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn is prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

Individuals planning pregnancy should be supplied with folic acid beginning ≥ 4 weeks before trying to conceive and continuing until 12 weeks' gestation to prevent neural tube defects. Infants born to folate-deficient mothers can develop megaloblastic anemia, but this carries no immediate postnatal complication or risk of mortality.",

Although breast milk contains only a small amount of iron, its bioavailability is high, which helps protect infants from iron deficiency during this period. After around 6 months of age, the introduction of iron-rich foods is recommended to prevent iron deficiency anemia.",

Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency would usually remain asymptomatic unless it led to rickets, which is not a life-threatening condition and not common in industrialized nations. However, as the amount of vitamin D in breastmilk is usually not sufficient to meet infants' daily requirements, vitamin D supplementation is recommended in exclusively and partially breastfed infants starting within the first few days of birth.",

Although patients with diGeorge syndrome typically present with hypocalcemic seizures and dysmorphic facial features, these facial features would be different (e.g., prominent nasal bridge, hypoplastic wing of the nose, dysplastic ears, or micrognathia). Moreover, this patient does not show other typical features of diGeorge syndrome, such as thymus hypoplasia (e.g., history of recurrent infections), cardiac anomalies, cleft palate, and hypoparathyroidism.",

Because the progeny is euploid, there is no visible gene defect on karyotyping. Angelman syndrome is more commonly caused by paternal imprinting, in which there is a deletion or mutation of the maternal UBE3A allele and the paternal UBE3A allele is silenced.",

    "hint": "This patient was rescued from a domestic fire and presents with dysphonia, soot in the airways, and singed eyebrows, suggesting inhalation injury. Inhalation injury in combination with altered mental status, loss of consciousness, nausea, headache, and dizziness is consistent with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "CO is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas with a > 200 times greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. CO occupies the oxygen binding site of hemoglobin, resulting in carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which has a reduced capacity to carry oxygen. CO also causes a left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve by stabilizing hemoglobin in its bound state, which inhibits oxygen release into tissues with low paO2. Measured oxygen saturation is typically normal because standard pulse oximeters cannot differentiate between oxyhemoglobin and COHb. Patients should receive 100% O2 or hyperbaric O2 to offset CO bound to heme.",

When carbon monoxide (CO) is bound to 50% of hemoglobin (green line), the maximal volume of O_2 bound to hemoglobin decreases and there is a left shift in the graph, reflecting the increase in O_2 affinity of hemoglobin.",

It loosely binds to oxygenated hemoglobin to keep oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the lungs. Reduced 2,3-BPG shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, causing tissue hypoxia.

The ferrous ion is the site of oxygen binding in hemoglobin, so it is necessary to restore the correct oxidation state of iron for effective delivery of oxygen to peripheral tissues.

Other important treatments include hydroxocobalamin, which binds cyanide to form the harmless compound cyanocobalamin, and sodium thiosulfate, which converts cyanide to thiocyanide, allowing for safe excretion.\n\nNitrite therapy is not recommended in patients with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, as inducing methemoglobinemia can worsen tissue hypoxia.",

        "explanation_why": "The chelation of calcium by citrate is the cause of hypocalcemia following massive blood transfusion. Citrate is an anticoagulant that is central to the storage of blood products. During transfusion, citrate prevents activation of the clotting cascade by chelating free extracellular calcium (a necessary cofactor for many steps in the coagulation cascade), resulting in transient hypocalcemia post-transfusion. In patients with symptomatic hypocalcemia, as seen here, calcium replacement therapy must be administered.",

However, ionized (or free) calcium concentrations are regulated hormonally and thus will not be affected. Since only ionized calcium is biologically active, hypocalcemia due to hypoalbuminemia usually is asymptomatic (pseudohypocalcemia) and would not explain this patient's symptoms.",

Symptoms include fever, flushing, pruritus, flank pain, dyspnea and a burning pain at the IV site; none of which are present in this patient.

Manifestations of pyridoxine toxicity include peripheral neuropathy, rash, and photosensitivity, none of which is seen in this patient. In fact, pyridoxine deficiency (e.g., due to alcohol use disorder), not toxicity, is associated with deep vein thrombosis due to impairment of conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine, which is dependent on vitamin B_6. Accumulation of homocysteine results in a hypercoagulable state, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events.",

This patient's alcohol use disorder puts her at risk of cobalamin deficiency due to malnutrition; however, because cobalamin is also required to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, increased methylmalonic acid serum concentrations would be expected.

        "explanation_why": "Folate serves as a coenzyme in several biochemical reactions, including the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Since this reaction is also vitamin B_12-dependent, a deficiency of either vitamin (e.g., from malnutrition due to alcohol use disorder) results in the accumulation of homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia leads to hypercoagulability and is therefore associated with thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis. The underlying mechanisms include decreased endothelial antithrombotic activity and activation of procoagulatory factors (e.g., factor V, factor VII). A normal serum methylmalonic acid concentration, as seen here, indicates folate deficiency rather than vitamin B_12 deficiency.\n\nIn addition to malnutrition, folate deficiency can also be caused by malabsorptive conditions (e.g., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease), increased vitamin requirements (e.g., due to pregnancy), and certain drugs (e.g., methotrexate, phenytoin, trimethoprim).",

Some patients with this condition present with neurological complications such as developmental regression (e.g., loss of speech and motor skills), loss of vision (from macular atrophy and uveitis), and seizures. However, Gaucher disease is not associated with brain or optic atrophy (optic disc pallor) or globoid cells on brain biopsy. Instead, typical manifestations of Gaucher disease include hepatosplenomegaly, petechiae, painful bone crises, and pathological fractures, none of which is seen here.",

This condition can manifest with developmental regression (e.g., loss of speech and motor skills), vision loss, and seizures. However, TSD is typically also associated with muscle weakness and hypotonia (not hypertonia), hyperreflexia, hearing impairment and a cherry-red spot on the macula on fundoscopic examination (not optic disc pallor), none of which is present here. Moreover, brain biopsy of a patient with TSD typically reveals lysosomes with an onion skin appearance, not globoid cells.",

Characteristic pathologic findings resulting from the toxic effect of these breakdown products include globoid cells and progressive loss of myelin sheaths. Krabbe disease most commonly manifests in early infancy with developmental regression (e.g., loss of speech and motor skills), fever, limb spasticity, brain and optic atrophy (optic disc pallor and vision loss), and seizures, as seen in this patient. Further symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, axial hypotonia, absent reflexes, and microcephaly. Progressive decerebration usually leads to death before the age of two.\n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been shown to improve outcomes if performed before the onset of symptoms.",

To reduce these side effects, aspirin or ibuprofen can be taken prior to the administration of niacin to decrease the production of prostaglandins. Taking the medication with food and/or using a prolonged release formulation can also help mitigate these side effects.\n\nNiacin can also cause hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hypotension, and hepatotoxicity.",

His joint pain may be caused by hemarthroses from vitamin C deficiency or may be due to his underlying osteoarthritis. Populations at increased risk for developing nutritional deficiencies include individuals with substance use disorders, the elderly, and patients who are chronically ill, such as this man with non-small cell lung carcinoma who may have poor intake due to loss of appetite and chemotherapy-induced nausea. The treatment for scurvy is vitamin C supplementation.",

This defect leads to accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates of the early steps of heme synthesis, such as porphobilinogen and δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA). Neurologic dysfunction (manifesting as sensorimotor, psychiatric, and autonomic symptoms, all of which are seen here) may also be caused by an impaired electron transport chain and energy production due to lack of heme. Precipitating factors for AIP attacks include alcohol, smoking, fasting, and certain drugs (e.g., cytochrome P450 inducers). Treatment includes cessation of such substances and administration of hemin and glucose, which inhibit δ-ALA synthase.\n\nIn patients with AIP, urobilinogen urine dipstick findings can be false-positive because of a cross-reaction between porphobilinogen and urobilinogen. The reddish-brown urine color, which may be mistaken for hematuria, is due to the accumulation of porphyrins.",

The severe subtypes (types II, III) of OI are usually due to a new (sporadic) mutation in one of these genes, while patients with the mild forms (types I, IV) typically have a parent with the condition. Additional findings in patients with OI include blue sclerae (due to choroidal veins appearing through the overlying thin sclerae), easy bruising, and brittle, opalescent teeth.\n\nIn this patient, the described irregular bones around the cranial sutures are indicative of wormian bones.

Carotenemia can result from excessive consumption of sweet potatoes, leafy greens, carrots, and oranges; increased intake of carotene-rich supplements may also cause carotenemia. This patient's weight gain, fatigue, brittle nails, and cold skin indicates hypothyroidism, which leads to reduced production of vitamin A from beta-carotene due to lack of thyroxine, thereby further increasing beta-carotene levels.",

Hereditary homocystinuria can be caused by one of several autosomal recessive enzyme defects; the increase in serum methionine indicates which enzyme is deficient.",

If untreated, patients with PKU develop generalized hypopigmentation, as seen here, because tyrosine is a precursor of melanin and high phenylalanine levels inhibit the enzyme responsible for melanin synthesis. However, the clinical features of PKU are not seen at birth because the fetus obtains tyrosine from maternal blood, and excess phenylalanine (as well as its toxic byproducts) is removed by the placenta. The features of PKU (e.g., hypopigmentation, seizures, intellectual disability, a musty odor) typically develop during infancy following the initiation of feeding.",

Tyrosinase is encoded by the TYR gene on chromosome 11; a defect in this gene is responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), which manifests as hypopigmentation of the hair, skin, and irides with a normal density of melanocytes on skin biopsy, as seen here. The neurological and physical development of infants with OCA1 is similar to that of normal infants, but they have an increased risk of skin cancer and visual abnormalities and therefore need to undergo skin and eye screenings periodically.",

        "explanation_why": "Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is an autosomal recessive enzyme defect of the glycolytic pathway that results in extravascular hemolytic anemia. It is the second most prevalent erythrocyte enzyme disorder (after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency). A higher incidence has been observed within Pennsylvania Amish communities, most likely as a result of the founder effect. The severity of the disease is highly variable; PKD can manifest with fetal demise due to hydrops fetalis, symptomatic anemia from birth that requires lifelong transfusions, or chronic compensated hemolysis. A peripheral blood smear typically shows normal erythrocyte morphology, but echinocytes are sometimes seen. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring pyruvate kinase enzyme activity.",

This leads to progressive demyelination in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Childhood onset is characterized by psychomotor regression, impaired memory, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, ataxia, and optic nerve atrophy that can lead to vision loss. Nerve conduction studies reveal decreased velocities due to demyelination. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is diagnosed by finding deficient ARSA enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes or dried blood spots, and/or by identifying pathogenic mutations in the ARSA gene. A positive family history of progressive neurological decline supports the diagnosis of genetic leukodystrophy.",
