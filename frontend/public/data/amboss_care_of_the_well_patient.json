        "explanation_why": "Malaria chemoprophylaxis consists of the preventive administration of certain drugs (e.g., atovaquone-proguanil, mefloquine). Currently, the risk of malaria for US travelers to Mexico is very low. Mexico City is considered malaria-free. Therefore, the CDC does not routinely recommend the use of antimalarial drugs for individuals traveling to Mexico except for travelers going to the very South or some states near the Pacific coast.",

International travelers to countries where the disease is endemic or where there is a low availability of vaccines (e.g., countries in Africa, South America, Southeast Asia, remote locations) should also receive the vaccine. This patient is going on a business trip, so he will not be in any remote locations for a long period of time.",

Vaccination against vibrio cholerae is indicated in travelers going to countries in which cholera infections are reported regularly or where a cholera outbreak is occurring. Although there has been a cholera epidemic in Mexico in the past, the risk for this business traveler is very low as long as he follows simple preventative measures (water and food hygiene).",

Travelers to these areas should receive an HAV vaccine (ideally ≥ 2 weeks before traveling). Individuals who are due to travel to these areas in < 2 weeks require both an HAV vaccine and immune globulin, which should be injected at different anatomical sites at the same time. Because HAV is transmitted mainly via the consumption of food or water that has been contaminated with feces (e.g., shellfish), travelers should also be advised to follow primary preventive measures such as washing hands, boiling or chlorinating water, and avoiding raw food.\n\nAs of 2006, routine immunization against HAV is recommended for all children in the US older than 12 months.",

She is married and has two children. The patient recently got back from a cruise to Mexico where she celebrated her 40^th wedding anniversary. She takes a multivitamin daily and uses topical steroids. Her immunization records show that she has never received a pneumococcal or a shingles vaccine, her last tetanus booster was 6 years ago, and her last influenza vaccine was 2 years ago. She drinks one to two alcoholic beverages every weekend. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (160 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m^2.

This patient's HbA_1c was 7.6% (typical goal is < 7%) 2 months ago, and it should be rechecked in 1 month.

The influenza vaccination helps prevent influenza and its complications, especially in vulnerable populations like older adults, very young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions. This patient with diabetes would particularly benefit from receiving the influenza vaccine because he is at higher risk of developing complications. Because he works at an assisted-living facility, he is also at increased risk of contracting and spreading the infection.",

Colonoscopy every 10 years is an appropriate strategy. Individuals with a first-degree relative (FDR) who have a history of colorectal cancer, like this patient, are generally recommended to obtain screening more frequently (every 5 years) and start earlier (40 years of age or 10 years before the youngest FDR's age at diagnosis).

        "explanation_why": "Most influenza vaccines are made from viruses grown in chicken eggs, raising the concern that allergic reactions might occur in those with a history of egg allergy. However, studies show that individuals with confirmed egg allergy can safely receive the influenza vaccine. According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), egg allergy of any severity is not a contraindication for influenza vaccines. All vaccines should be administered in settings where treatment can be given for an acute allergic reaction. No special precautions beyond this standard are required for the administration of influenza vaccine to patients with egg allergy regardless of allergy severity. An influenza vaccine is contraindicated in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis following previous administration of the vaccine or following exposure to a component of the vaccine other than egg protein.\n\nIndividuals aged ≥ 50 years should receive either the recombinant influenza vaccine or the inactivated influenza vaccine.",

Even a confirmed allergy against egg proteins is not a contraindication for vaccination. Skin testing is recommended for evaluation of patients with a history of allergy to the vaccine itself (which may be caused by a component other than ovalbumin such as preservatives) or latex from gloves.",

        "explanation_why": "The influenza vaccine (either live-attenuated or inactivated) is recommended every year during flu season, from October to April in the northern hemisphere and April to October in the southern hemisphere. The composition of each vaccine is adjusted for the hemisphere in which it is given, which may not always be antigenically identical. Despite providing only partial immunity in these cases, the influenza vaccine in the northern hemisphere typically provides protection against the main viruses that are circulating in other parts of the world. Therefore, vaccination of patients who have not received the influenza vaccine during the influenza season is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and World Health Organization at least 2 weeks prior to travel. Although a US-licensed influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere can be given to patients prior to travel, it is generally not commercially available and the vaccine for the northern hemisphere is used.",

The previously recommended age to start screening was 50 years. Colonoscopy every 10 years is an appropriate strategy.

        "explanation_why": "The diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is given to children < 7 years of age as a 5-dose regimen at 2, 4, 6, 15–18 months, and 4–6 years of age, respectively. This preterm infant has no indications that would delay the DTaP vaccine, such as uncontrolled seizures or nervous system disease, and can receive the vaccine at 2 months of chronological age.\n\nNote that the Hepatitis B vaccine would be given before the DTaP vaccine but not immediately after birth, which is the standard immunization schedule for term newborns > 2000 g of birth weight. Infants with low birth weight have weak production of protective anti-HBs antibodies, so newborns < 2000 g should receive their first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine at 1 month of age (regardless of weight at that time) or upon discharge from the hospital, whichever comes sooner. All other vaccines are administered according to the standard immunization schedule, taking the infant's chronological age into account, irrespective of prematurity.",

According to the CDC, the hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as a 3-dose regimen, with the first dose administered at birth, the second dose at 1–2 months, and the third dose at 6–18 months of age in children whose mothers are HbsAg-negative, such as this newborn's fully-immunized mother. However, infants with low birth weight have weak production of protective anti-HBs antibodies, so newborns < 2000 g should receive their first dose at 1 month of age (regardless of weight at that time) or upon discharge from the hospital, whichever comes sooner. This newborn currently weighs 1550-g (3.3-lb), so hepatitis B vaccine administration would not be recommended at this time.",

These procedures include certain dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, routine dental cleaning), procedures of the respiratory tract that involve incision of the respiratory mucosa, and cardiac surgery with prosthetic material (e.g., prosthetic heart valves). The most commonly used antibiotic regimen is oral amoxicillin administered 30–60 minutes prior to a high-risk procedure. Alternatives to amoxicillin include intravenous ampicillin in patients unable to take oral medication and azithromycin in patients allergic to penicillin.",

Three months ago, she received her first dose of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), first dose of varicella, third dose of Haemophilus influenza type B (HiB), fourth dose of pneumococcal conjugate (PCV15), and third dose of polio vaccine. Thirteen days after receiving these vaccinations, the child developed a fever up to 40.5°C (104.9°F) and had one generalized seizure that lasted for 2 minutes. She was taken to the emergency department. The girl was sent home after workup for the seizure was unremarkable and her temperature subsided with acetaminophen therapy. She has not had any other symptoms since then. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her mother is concerned about receiving further vaccinations because she is afraid of her daughter having more seizures. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows no abnormalities.

This 21-month-old's development has been normal thus far, and he has met all the age-appropriate milestones. He has a normal gait and shows no signs or symptoms of an underlying pathological condition (e.g., unilateral deformity, abnormally short stature, fever, limb swelling).

She says that she has been gradually sleeping less over the past couple of months. It takes her 20–25 minutes to fall asleep each night, and she wakes up earlier in the morning than she used to. On average, she sleeps 5–6 hours each night. She says that she has also been waking up several times per night and needs about 20 minutes to fall asleep again. She feels mildly tired in the afternoon but does not take any naps. Her husband reports that she does not snore. She takes a 45-minute walk with her husband and their dog every other day. The patient drinks two cups of coffee each morning. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 55 kg (121 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m^2.

He has been wetting the bed about 1–2 times per week. He has not had daytime urinary incontinence or dysuria. His teachers report that he is attentive in preschool and plays well with his peers. He is able to name 5 colors, follow three-step commands, and recite his address. He can do a somersault, use scissors, and copy a square. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

This conditioning trains children to wake up before urinating, thus preventing enuresis. Enuresis alarms are the first-line treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children who do not respond to behavioral modifications (e.g., frequent voiding, evening fluid restriction, motivational therapy). Since bedwetting is not considered abnormal before the age of 5 years, this patient does not meet criteria for diagnosis of nocturnal enuresis. Enuresis alarms are not indicated in this patient at this time.",

Regardless, both types show swelling, erythema, warmth, and/or tenderness on examination, which are not present in this patient.",

Deficiency also causes hypocalcemia, which can lead to paresthesias, twitching, or dysrhythmias. Although this child's pain could be explained by vitamin D deficiency, she does not show any other signs consistent with vitamin D deficiency.",

The cramping pain most commonly occurs at the end of the day or during the night, ranges from mild to severe, and can awaken the child from sleep. Symptoms typically resolve by the morning and are not present during the day or during periods of activity. Growing pains is a clinical diagnosis because physical examination and diagnostic imaging show no abnormalities. Management consists of analgesics and massages, and reassuring patients and their parents of the condition's benign nature.",

While patients with congenital GH deficiency usually also have a normal birth length, they are often already symptomatic in the neonatal period, with hypoglycemia and prolonged jaundice. In addition, IGF-1 levels should only be evaluated in patients with slow growth (e.g., downward deviation of growth curves, change in percentiles) or with extremely short stature (< 0.6^th percentile).",

Although hypothyroidism may also cause delayed puberty, a different initial test is required to identify the underlying causes of short stature in an otherwise healthy patient. Additional testing (e.g., celiac serology, thyroid function tests) is warranted if the child is extremely short (< 0.6^th percentile) or if the history and physical examination are consistent with a specific disorder.",

This patient was of normal length at birth and both parents are of normal size, which suggests a constitutional growth delay. Patients with constitutional growth delay typically have a delayed bone age and, after a brief downward shift in percentiles after birth, a constant growth rate at or below the 3^rd percentile during childhood.\n\nPatients with constitutional growth delay present with short stature during childhood, but their delayed bone age is associated with a longer period of growth, with most ultimately reaching their adult target height. Patients and their families should be reassured, but growth and development should be monitored nonetheless to rule out any pathologies.",

However, in a tumor large enough to cause GH deficiency, visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopsia) would likely also be present. Furthermore, imaging of the brain is only indicated in patients with short stature who have an established growth hormone deficiency or are at high risk for intracranial neoplasm (e.g., history of cranial irradiation).",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus typically have a steeper drop in blood glucose during exercise than healthy individuals, putting them at an increased risk for hypoglycemia. Exercise increases overall insulin sensitivity, which promotes glycolysis and inhibits gluconeogenesis. In addition, an exercise-induced increase in body temperature and blood flow can accelerate resorption of subcutaneous insulin deposits, therefore, injection into arms or legs that are exercised should be avoided. Lower insulin dosages (i.e., decreased by 1–2 units per 20–30 minutes of physical activity) should be administered on days of exercise. Furthermore, patients should be advised to closely monitor their blood glucose before, during, and after exercise, to watch for symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., sweating, lightheadedness), and to eat slowly-absorbed carbohydrates after exercising to prevent delayed hypoglycemia.",

The parents report that they have sometimes noticed a discharge of small quantities of a white liquid from the left breast since yesterday. During pregnancy, the mother was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was treated with L-thyroxine. The patient's maternal grandmother died of breast cancer. The patient currently weighs 3100 g (6 lb 10 oz) and is 51 cm (20 in) in length. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows symmetrically enlarged, nontender breasts, with bilaterally inverted nipples. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

Both gynecomastia and galactorrhea usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks or months and do not require treatment.",

However, patients with Turner syndrome and idiopathic short stature disorders typically present with a bone age normal for their chronological age. Patients with GHD can have a delayed bone age and experience delayed puberty. However, in cases of GHD, either a growth delay is apparent within the first few months of life, or the associated characteristic features of acquired GHD, such as an immature (“cherubic”) fat distribution and characteristic facial features (underdeveloped nasal bridge and frontal bossing), are present. Moreover, before GH supplementation is initiated, a definitive diagnosis should be unequivocally established with hormonal assays and serial measurements of length or height. Therefore, GH treatment is not appropriate as the next step of management in this patient.",

In addition, congenital GnRH deficiency is very rare and often associated with other findings (e.g., hyposmia/anosmia in Kallmann syndrome or skeletal abnormalities such as cleft lip/palate or syndactyly).

Affected individuals usually have a normal length at birth, but growth velocity decreases between 6 months and 3 years of age. Bone age is typically delayed by 2–4 years causing growth to take longer than usual. After a growth spurt in late adolescence, patients usually reach a normal adult height. While patients should be closely monitored to ensure that growth velocity does not decrease further, treatment is not indicated.\n\nFurther testing to rule out pathological causes should be performed in all patients with delayed puberty, who present with changes in growth velocity for at least 6 months and/or with signs of underlying disease. Testing should include a CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, BUN, creatinine, liver function tests, and hormonal tests (e.g., LH, FSH, estradiol, testosterone, TSH).",

Since this girl's father has a history of drug abuse, unintentional contact with these substances should be considered. However, symptoms would typically have an acute onset, would not last for two months as in this girl, and would be different in character (e.g., perception of unusual colors).",

Signs of abuse and neglect can be subtle and history findings of parental drug use should certainly raise concern for the child's well-being. Although patients, particularly following sexual abuse, can develop hallucinations, these hallucinations commonly cause distress rather than comfort as in this patient. Additionally, this patient's age-appropriate milestones, the absence of signs of physical abuse, and the fact that she attends preschool regularly make child maltreatment less likely.",

Further evaluation is only indicated if the imaginary friends persist beyond early school age, or if the child's general behavior or development changes.\n\nStress factors such as the parent's divorce can cause various behavioral responses in different age groups. Preschoolers such as this girl often display magical thinking and may believe that their actions caused the divorce. They can subsequently develop unusual or odd behaviors in the hope of reconciling their parents. Parents should be advised to reassure the child that their actions had no influence on the decision to get a divorce. A counselor can assist if problems persist.",

Individuals with a first-degree relative (FDR) with a history of colorectal cancer, like this patient, are generally recommended to obtain screening more frequently (every 5 years) and start earlier (40 years of age or 10 years before the youngest FDR's age at diagnosis).

This guidance differs from the recently updated ASCCP, ACS, and ACOG guidelines, which recommend that those aged 25–65 years undergo cervical cancer screening with primary HPV testing (where available) or HPV/Pap cotesting every 5 years. All guidelines recommend a solitary Pap smear every 3 years if HPV testing is unavailable.\n\nRegarding breast cancer, mammography is rarely useful in younger patients, who have naturally denser breast tissue. According to the USPSTF, breast cancer screening with mammography should be performed every 2 years between 40–74 years of age. Screening can be started earlier in patients with first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Breast cancer screening recommendations may differ between medical organizations (e.g., ACOG, ACS). Consult our table “Breast cancer screening for individuals at average risk” for the most up-to-date information on breast cancer screening recommendations.\n\nWhenever the information required to determine the correct answer for an NBME question involves a discrepancy between screening guidelines, we recommend following USPSTF recommendations.",

Patients in this situation may desire additional diagnostic testing and/or pregnancy termination.

        "explanation_why": "Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) testing of maternal blood can be used to screen for fetal aneuploidies such as Down syndrome. Because of its low false-positive rate for Down syndrome, cffDNA testing is commonly used as a secondary screening test in patients at high risk (e.g., maternal age ≥ 35 years, abnormal screening results) in order to avoid invasive procedures. However, cffDNA testing is not diagnostic and fetal chromosomal analysis using an invasive test is still required to confirm Down syndrome.",

It is used in first-trimester screening (nuchal translucency measurement) and subsequent second-trimester serum testing (quadruple test or triple screen), or during the integrated screening process (nuchal translucency with quadruple screening). Findings that suggest a diagnosis of Down syndrome during the second trimester include nuchal fold thickness ≥ 6 mm, intracardiac hyperechogenic focus, and structural malformations.

For all unvaccinated female individuals aged 15–26 years, the CDC recommends vaccination with three doses of the nine-valent HPV vaccine at 0, 2, and 6 months. The HPV vaccine is approved by the FDA for individuals up to the age of 45 years, but it is not routinely recommended by the CDC for individuals aged > 26 years.\n\nCondoms lower the risk of, but do not protect against, HPV infection because HPV can still be transmitted via genital skin-to-skin contact or oral sex.",

Unfortunately, cancer screening recommendations can be confusing because the USPSTF guidelines differ from the recently updated ASCCP/ACS/ACOG guidelines, which recommend that women aged 25–65 years should undergo cervical cancer screening with primary HPV testing (preferred where available) every five years, cotesting (HPV testing and Pap smear) every five years, or a solitary Pap smear every three years.

Since the patient also started college 6 months ago and has recently intensified her training routine, her weight gain is most likely attributable to changes in eating habits and an increase in muscle mass. As the current treatment has also proven to be beneficial for her previous dysmenorrhea and acne, reassurance and advice on maintaining a healthy weight are the most appropriate steps in management.",

Typical clinical features include menstrual irregularities (e.g., amenorrhea), infertility, hirsutism, obesity, and acne.

Common clinical features include hypertension, central obesity, moon facies, easily bruisable skin and acne, muscle atrophy, and features of virilization in women (hirsutism, menstrual cycle irregularities).

His mother recently returned to work 2 weeks ago. She explains that, since then, her son has had a tantrum roughly every other morning, usually when she is getting him dressed or dropping him off at daycare. He cries loudly for about 5 minutes, saying that he does not want to go to daycare while thrashing his arms and legs. According to the daycare staff, he is well-behaved during the day. In the evenings, he has tantrums about twice per week, typically when he is told he must finish his dinner or that it is time for bed. These tantrums have been occurring for about 6 months. The mother is concerned her son may have a behavioral disorder. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the boy's behavior?",

Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 8700/mm3, CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 480 cells/mm3, and anti-HBs antibody titer is 150 mIU/mL. Which of the following recommendations is most appropriate at this time?",

Adults with uncertain immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) such as those with unknown vaccination status, no laboratory evidence of immunity, or born after 1957, should be given a dose of MMR vaccine, provided the CD4+ count is > 200 cells/mm^3. Further recommendations for patients with HIV include vaccinations for pneumococcal disease and influenza (using the inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccines, as the live-attenuated vaccine is not recommended regardless of CD4+ count). The efficacy of immunization is reduced in patients with HIV infection.",

        "explanation_why": "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement may be considered as part of the screening process for prostate cancer, a common malignancy that is often asymptomatic in the initial stages. Current screening guidelines for prostate-specific antigen testing are controversial. The use of PSA as a screening marker is constantly questioned because of potential overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and associated complications such as negative psychological effects, erectile dysfunction, or urine incontinence. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against any routine PSA-based screening for prostate cancer; they recommend that decisions about PSA assessment in men aged 55–69 years who inquire about screening be made based on patient preference after having received information on potential risks and benefits. The American Urological Association recommends PSA testing on a case-by-case basis in men aged 45–69 years after shared decision-making based on individual preferences. PSA testing is not recommended in men < 40 years of age.\n\nThis patient is 60 years old and he has a family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative; a discussion about PSA screening would be warranted. Following the discussion, PSA levels should only be obtained if the patient expresses that he wants to proceed with the screening test.",

        "explanation_why": "A soft S_4 gallop does not warrant an echocardiogram in an elderly patient who is asymptomatic, as it most likely indicates age-related decreased ventricular compliance. Indications for echocardiogram include a palpable S_4 or symptoms concerning for acute myocardial infarction (e.g., chest pain) or heart failure (e.g., dyspnea or lower extremity edema). Moreover, a transthoracic echocardiogram rather than a transesophageal echocardiogram would be the most appropriate initial step in the workup of an abnormal S_4 gallop.",

Although screening recommendations for DM differ among expert groups, this 38-year-old patient with dyslipidemia and a BMI of 29 kg/m^2 meets the screening criteria of both the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The USPSTF recommends screening individuals 35–70 years of age with overweight or obesity. The ADA recommends screening all individuals ≥ 35 years of age and individuals < 35 years of age who: have overweight or obesity and ≥ 1 additional risk factor for T2DM; have a history of prediabetes or gestational diabetes; or have any risk-enhancing comorbidities (e.g., HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, post organ transplantation).\n\nBesides FBG, other tests used to screen for DM include hemoglobin A_1C (HbA_1C) and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Each of the following findings can be used to establish a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus: FBG ≥ 126 mg/dL, HbA_1C ≥ 6.5%, and a 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during an OGTT.",

She is worried he may be going through some sort of “problem.” He is currently in 9^th grade. His mother says that he recently made his high school varsity wrestling team and does reasonably well in school. The patient had separation anxiety disorder at the age of 9 years, which resolved with cognitive behavioral therapy. On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?",

Infants born to thiamine-deficient mothers can develop infantile beriberi, which, if untreated, can be life-threatening.

        "explanation_why": "Vitamin K levels are low in all newborns because very little crosses the placental barrier, and its concentration in breast milk is insignificant. In addition, newborns have sterile intestines, and the establishment of gut microflora that synthesizes vitamin K takes approximately 6 months. As vitamin K is necessary for the production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, not supplementing it within a few hours after birth can enable a potentially fatal hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Another risk factor for vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn is prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency would usually remain asymptomatic unless it led to rickets, which is not a life-threatening condition and not common in industrialized nations.

Because of the risk of congenital abnormalities following infection with rubella or varicella in pregnancy, the MMR and varicella vaccines are especially recommended. In patients with no evidence of immunity to rubella (e.g., those who did not receive the MMR vaccine), rubella antibody testing should be used to screen for immunity, and vaccination should be recommended in individuals without immunity. The MMR and varicella vaccines are live vaccines, which are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential risk of infection in the birthing parent and consequent vertical transmission. Accordingly, conception should be avoided for 1–3 months after immunization.\n\nIn the past, administering the MMR vaccine to children with egg allergies raised concerns because of residual egg proteins in the vaccine. However, the MMR vaccine is currently considered safe for children with egg allergy.",

        "explanation_why": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are common worldwide, with a global prevalence of approx. 250 million HBV carriers. Screening tests for HBV infection are indicated for asymptomatic patients who have a high risk for previous HBV exposure. This population includes people who were born in countries with high HBV prevalence, such as the Philippines (and all countries in Asia). Accordingly, this patient should undergo serologic testing for HBV, which includes the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (anti-HBs).\n\nOther populations that should receive screening for HBV infection include women who are pregnant, patients who receive immunosuppressive therapy, blood donors, and children with mothers who have HBV infection.",

However, because of the overall low incidence of testicular cancer and its high survival rate (5-year survival rate of > 95%), screening examinations (by either clinicians or patients) are unlikely to provide meaningful health benefits and are, therefore, not recommended in patients who are asymptomatic.",

The American Diabetes Association recommends screening all individuals ≥ 35 years, and individuals < 35 years of age with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m^2 and at least one additional risk factor (e.g., physical inactivity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, a first-degree relative with diabetes).

    "content_preview": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician because his parents are concerned about their son's physical changes. The parents say that he is showing signs of puberty earlier than his older siblings. He is about to turn 10 years in 2 months. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medication. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 97th percentile for height and 99th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits.

Children do not start puberty at the same age, and, while he is developing earlier than his siblings, he is still within the normal distribution. Additionally, this patient is following the normal sequence of development (in boys: adrenarche, gonadarche, pubarche, and growth spurt) with Tanner stage 3 for genital development and Tanner stage 2 for pubic hair development. His height is in the 97^th percentile and weight is in the 99^th percentile, indicating that he has hit the pubertal growth spurt.\n\nPrecocious puberty should be suspected if secondary sex characteristics (e.g., testicular enlargement in males) appear before the age of 9 years in boys or 8 years in girls.",

The parents report that she has been crying excessively since the last visit and are concerned that she is not well. Their babysitter has told them that she does not stop crying even with feeding or burping. They say that she used to be calm when she was left alone, but over the past week, she starts to cry whenever they leave the room. She was exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age. Her parents have gradually introduced semisolid foods over the past three months. She is at the 75^th percentile for height and weight. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, she turns her head when her name is called. She coos “ma” and “da.” She crawls on the examination table, is able to independently get into a seated position, and passes a teddy from one hand to the other. She can be pulled up to stand but cannot stand without support. Plantar reflex is present bilaterally. The anterior fontanelle is soft. She begins to cry when the physician picks her up. The remainder of the examination does not show any abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The patient's father reports that the patient had continual crying, increased irritability, and fever for the past 2 days. He has noticed that the patient keeps tugging at his left ear. The patient was born at 32 weeks' gestation but has been otherwise healthy and has no history of serious illness. At the fourth well-child visit, the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, Hemophilus influenza type b (Hib), pneumococcal conjugate (PCV15), inactivated poliovirus, and hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines were administered. He is at the 25^th percentile for length and weight with respect to chronological age; when corrected for gestational age, he is at the 40^th percentile for length and weight. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F); the remainder of his vital signs are within normal limits. Otoscopic examination of the left ear shows an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane; examination of the right ear shows no abnormalities. Treatment with ibuprofen and amoxicillin is initiated. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation by the physician regarding immunization?",

Neither mild acute illness (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, low-grade fever, mild diarrhea) nor current antibiotic therapy are contraindications for vaccination (except for oral live typhoid vaccine, because antibiotics might compromise the immune response to this vaccine). All children must be immunized with the standard doses of vaccines according to their chronological age; doses should not be adjusted to weight or gestational age.\n\nThe only vaccine that depends on the child's birth weight is the first dose of HepB vaccine; infants with a birth weight < 2 kg should receive the first dose of the vaccine at 1 month of age or at hospital discharge, whichever occurs first.",

Moderate to severe acute illness with or without fever is a precaution for vaccine administration. Mild illnesses, such as otitis media and low-grade fever are not contraindications for vaccination. Adjusting the dosage based on weight is not recommended for the vaccines indicated in this patient (Hib vaccine, PCV15, varicella vaccine, and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine).",

More frequent screening is recommended for individuals with risk factors for HCV infection, such as a history of injection drug use, solid-organ transplantation, long-term hemodialysis, or HIV infection. Screening is performed by testing the serum for anti-HCV antibodies; if screening is positive, the diagnosis can be confirmed with polymerase chain reaction testing for HCV RNA.

Although PID is most often asymptomatic, it can result in severe complications, including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, both the USPSTF and CDC recommend annual screening with a nucleic acid amplification test for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active women < 25 years and women ≥ 25 years with certain risk factors (e.g., new or multiple sex partners, a sex partner with an STI). The CDC also recommends annual screening for both sexually active HIV-positive men and men who have sex with men because of the higher incidence of gonorrhea and chlamydia infections in these populations. Routine chlamydia and gonorrhea screening is not currently recommended for sexually active, HIV-negative men in monogamous, heterosexual relationships, such as this patient.",

Prostate cancer screening is most commonly performed using a serum prostate-specific antigen test every 2 years. Screening can be initiated earlier at 40 years for patients with a first-degree relative who developed early-onset prostate cancer (i.e., before 65 years).

She was born by cesarean delivery at 36 weeks’ gestation because of bleeding due to placenta previa. There is no family history of serious illness. She can prop herself up on her hands when in a prone position and rolls from front to back. When placed in a seated position, she leans on her hands to support herself. She can grasp her toy rattle with her index finger and thumb and can transfer it from one hand to the other. She babbles “mama” and “dada.” She cries if anyone apart from her parents holds her or plays with her. She laughs when her parents play peek-a-boo and orients to her name. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 55^th percentile for head circumference, 40^th percentile for length, and 45^th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following developmental milestones is delayed in this infant?",

This child is only able to prop herself up on her hands when in a prone position, roll from front to back, and sit in a tripod position when placed in a seated position, all of which reflect the gross motor skills of a 6-month-old child. See “Developmental milestones in infants” table.\n\nThe delay of a milestone, especially in combination with a problematic history, such as the complicated preterm birth of this patient, should prompt further evaluation. Since developmental milestones are not a precise tool for measuring pediatric development, the delay of a milestone should prompt further evaluation, e.g., using standardized developmental screening tests such as the Denver Developmental Screening Test II. If these tests confirm the presence of developmental delay, the underlying causes should be investigated and early intervention initiated.",

Breast tissue enlargement is another physiological change that occurs during puberty and typically manifests with small, firm, mobile breast masses that are either unilateral or bilateral. Pubertal gynecomastia is due to a more rapid increase in estrogen levels compared to testosterone and generally resolves by the age of 17–18 years when the adult ratio of estrogen/androgen is reached. Since this patient does not present with any concerning symptoms (e.g., overlying skin changes, nipple discharge, rapid enlargement of either mass, excessive pain), reassurance and observation are sufficient. If gynecomastia persists after 17–18 years of age, surgical removal of the breast glandular tissue can be considered.",

The previously recommended age to start screening was 50 years. Colonoscopy every 10 years is an appropriate strategy. Because this patient had his last colonoscopy 8 years ago, which was normal, and lacks symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (e.g., weight loss, hematochezia), a colonoscopy is not indicated at this time.",

However, screening in asymptomatic patients is not indicated in the general population because it is not cost-effective, owing to the prevalence being too low and these aneurysms having a low risk of rupture. Screening may be considered in patients with genetic conditions associated with a higher incidence of intracranial aneurysms (e.g., autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and in patients with first-degree relatives with a history of intracranial aneurysms, neither of which is seen here.",

She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and constipation. Her current medication includes valsartan, salmeterol, and a fiber supplement for constipation. She entered menopause last year. Four years ago, she underwent hemorrhoidectomy; a sigmoidoscopy at that time showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 66 years; the patient's last mammogram from 6 months ago was normal. Her last primary HPV test taken 3 years ago was negative. She does not drink alcohol. She smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years but quit 8 years ago when she was diagnosed with COPD. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows varicose veins in the lower extremities. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable for her age. Which of the following screening studies is most appropriate at this time?",

Screening recommendations for former smokers vary.

The previously recommended age to start screening was 50 years. Sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is an appropriate strategy. Because this patient had her last sigmoidoscopy 4 years ago, which was normal, and lacks symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (e.g., weight loss, hematochezia), sigmoidoscopy is not indicated at this time.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the US, a little under 50% of women and men experience IPV during their lifetime. The risk of IPV increases during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Screening can help to address immediate threats and prevent long-term IPV-associated conditions (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder). To screen for IPV, the physician can ask a single nonjudgmental and nonstigmatizing question (e.g., “Some of the patients I see have been hurt or threatened by someone close to them. Is this something that you have experienced?”). IPV screening tools include the HARK questions, HITS screening tool, and STaT questions. Management of IPV includes immediate and, most importantly, ongoing support.\n\nThe USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for IPV in other patient groups (men, women not of reproductive age, vulnerable individuals, older adults) because of a lack of evidence that such interventions provide any benefit to these patients. Other sources do recommend screening for IPV in these patient groups because of an absence of harm and a potential benefit. The WHO recommends targeted screening for patients with red flags for IPV.",

    "question_text": "An 8-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of irritability, drooling, and soft stools for the past 3 days. He has been sleeping poorly because he frequently wakes up crying, and breastfeeding does not always help to calm him. Yesterday, the mother noticed that he grabbed his right ear repeatedly and that he “felt a bit hotter than usual.” He is otherwise healthy and has been meeting all of his developmental milestones. He was exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age, when solid foods were introduced to his diet. He usually has a bowel movement 1–3 times per day. He has had no difficulty voiding. His only medication is a vitamin D supplement. His immunizations are up to date. He is at the 40^th percentile for height and at the 45^th percentile for weight. He is alert and fully oriented. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a crying infant. He is drooling and calms when a plastic toy is put in his mouth. Otoscopic examination shows normal tympanic membranes. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His abdomen is soft and nontender to palpation. His diaper contains soft yellow-brown stool. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time?",

        "explanation_why": "Senile purpura is a benign skin condition that typically affects individuals aged > 50 years and manifests with recurrent, irregularly-shaped, dark purple macules. It is caused by progressive loss of dermal connective tissue, subcutaneous fat, and blood vessel elasticity with age, all of which results in increased susceptibility to bruising in elderly individuals. Senile purpura is more common in light-skinned persons (due to increased sensitivity to sunlight) and typically develops on sun-exposed areas (e.g., forearms, face, neck). The diagnosis is clinical and does not require further evaluation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Anticipatory guidance to parents of preschoolers and school-age children consists of recommendations regarding nutrition, physical development (e.g., being physically active for at least 60 minutes daily), personal hygiene (e.g., brush twice and floss once a day), sleep, media use, cognitive and social development, techniques for behavioral modification (e.g., positive reinforcement for good behavior), and, most importantly, child safety. Unintentional injury is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children over 1 year of age. Children should always wear protective gear when performing high-risk activities (e.g., cycling, climbing) and use a child safety seat appropriate for age and anthropometry when riding in a car. At 5–6 years of age, the child should be taught safe street habits and, if possible, how to swim. Children under 6 years of age should be supervised continuously during play; for children aged 6–8 years, supervision is necessary when near bodies of water or when engaged in risky activities. At home, fire alarms should be installed, fire escape plans implemented, firearms removed or stored under lock-and-key, and potentially harmful household products and tools kept out of reach.\n\nChildren should be encouraged to tell their parents if they are being bullied or face other problems at school. To minimize the likelihood of abuse, children should also be told that no adults should ever ask them to keep a secret from their parents or express interest in the child’s private parts.",

At this age, daytime naps are not necessary and should not be forced, as they can delay sleep onset at night. The focus of guidance should be on establishing a routine for going to bed at night and sleeping. For children 6–12 years of age, 9–12 hours of sleep is recommended.",

However, instead of the parent setting expectations for academic performance, children should be encouraged to set their own achievable goals and ask for help as needed. Good behavior should be met with reinforcement (e.g., with praise, privileges) that is focused on actions rather than immutable traits (e.g., intelligence).",

To prevent difficulties, pacifiers should be introduced only after breastfeeding is well established. Pacifier use should be limited after 6 months of age to reduce the risk of otitis media and actively discouraged at approximately 2 years of age to prevent adverse dental effects (e.g., dental malocclusion).\n\nOther protective factors for SIDS include a supine sleeping position, a safe sleeping environment and location (e.g., firm surface, no soft objects, cosleeping without bed-sharing), exclusive breastfeeding until 4–6 months of age, and routine immunizations.",

He was exclusively breastfed until 4 months of age and recently started eating solid foods including chicken, peanut butter, and softened sweet potatoes and carrots. He uses a pacifier while sleeping and rides in the back seat of his mother's car on a forward-facing car seat. His father has a hunting rifle that he stores unloaded and locked on a high shelf in the garage. He is at the 60^th percentile for height and weight. Examination shows no abnormalities. He can sit upright without support. He babbles. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time?",

        "content": "Use rear-facing car seat until 2 years of age",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Children under 13 years of age are required by law to ride in the back seat on age- and weight-appropriate safety seats or boosters. From birth until at least 2 years of age and no later than when they outgrow the seat's height and weight limit (usually around 4 years of age), children should ride in a federally-approved rear-facing car seat. The use of age-appropriate restraints reduces the risk of injuries and death in motor vehicle collisions. Because front-seat airbags can injure or kill children during motor vehicle collisions, car seats should never be placed in the front seat.\n\nOther recommendations for parents of children at this age include education on oral development (e.g., teething usually begins between 6–10 months of age), nutrition, and household safety.",

        "explanation_why": "Prolonged pacifier use is associated with adverse effects, such as otitis media (especially at 2–3 years of age) and dental malocclusion (especially after 3 years of age). However, pacifier use during sleep can lower the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Pacifier use may also be beneficial when breastfeeding is not possible (e.g., due to maternal illness) and to prevent a persistent finger-sucking habit. Therefore, limiting pacifier use to naptime and bedtime is recommended from 6 months of age, but it should not be routinely discouraged until approximately 2 years of age.",

This includes an optimized intake of calcium and vitamin D, with recommended daily intakes of 1000–1200 mg of calcium and 800–1000 IU of vitamin D. Dietary sources are preferred over supplements unless a deficiency is present. Other preventive measures include physical exercise (e.g., strength training), smoking cessation, and limiting alcohol intake.\n\nScreening for osteoporosis is indicated in women ≥ 65 years and those with risk factors (e.g., long-term corticosteroid use).",

This 25-year-old patient was born after universal childhood hepatitis B immunization became standard practice; therefore, she likely received the full hepatitis B vaccine series in early childhood and does not require catch-up vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccine boosters are indicated only in high-risk patients (e.g., occupational exposure, immunocompromise, those receiving hemodialysis) who are nonimmune according to HBV serology (HBsAb < 10 IU/mL).",

After initial Tdap vaccination, all patients should receive tetanus-diphtheria vaccine or Tdap boosters every 10 years. This patient’s last tetanus-containing vaccine was at 12 years of age, so she is overdue for a Tdap booster. As a middle school teacher, protection against pertussis is especially important to prevent transmission to vulnerable children. Tdap also maintains immunity against diphtheria, which can cause severe illness.\n\nAnnual influenza vaccination is also recommended for all adults, including this patient, but Tdap is the most urgent vaccination in this scenario.",

The USPSTF advises beginning at age 21 with Pap smear alone every 3 years until age 29, and for individuals aged 30–65 years, either primary HPV testing every 5 years, HPV/Pap cotesting every 5 years, or Pap smear alone every 3 years. In contrast, recent guidelines from the ACS, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend starting primary HPV testing every 5 years at age 25, with HPV/Pap cotesting every 5 years as an alternative, and Pap smear alone every 3 years if HPV testing is unavailable. As this patient is 23 years of age, asymptomatic, and up-to-date with other preventive screenings, she should undergo cervical cancer screening with a Pap smear.",
