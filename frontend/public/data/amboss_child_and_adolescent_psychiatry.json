Osteopenia and osteoporosis are caused by a combination of nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin D deficiency) and hormone abnormalities (e.g., low estrogen and testosterone due to decreased pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus), which lead to decreased bone mineral density and thus significantly increase the risk of fractures. Furthermore, frequent and strenuous physical activity, which is very common in patients with anorexia nervosa such as this cheerleader, increases the risk of developing stress fractures.",

Early in life, a bicuspid valve is often asymptomatic or only becomes symptomatic with exertion. At this time, the condition typically manifests with a systolic click heard best at the left lower sternal border or apex. Bicuspid aortic valve predisposes to early-onset valvular calcifications, which can lead to premature aortic stenosis and/or insufficiency as early as the fourth decade of life. In contrast, senile calcific aortic stenosis peaks in patients > 80 years.\n\nPatients with bicuspid aortic valve are also at increased risk of infectious endocarditis.",

Common manifestations of inhalant use include mood swings (due to rapid onset and short duration of action), irritability, slurred speech, anorexia, conjunctival injection, poor concentration, ataxia (manifesting as, e.g., dysdiadochokinesia), and an eczematous rash in the perioral area (i.e., the glue-sniffer's rash, which is caused by the drying effects of hydrocarbons), all of which are seen in this patient. In severe cases, inhalant use can cause cardiac arrhythmias and severe central nervous system toxicity (e.g., seizures, coma, and death due to respiratory depression).",

Acute withdrawal symptoms include depression, anxiety, and increased appetite, rather than the irritability seen in this patient.

She has missed several days of school and has been hospitalized 2 times during the past 6 months for dehydration due to similar episodes of vomiting and nausea. The patient has lived with her mother since her parents divorced 8 months ago. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She is at the 60th percentile for height and 30th percentile for weight. She appears emaciated. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.8°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 82/52 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.

Etiology is likely multifactorial. The condition is often triggered by psychologic stress (e.g., parent's divorce). The diagnosis can only be made in the absence of anatomical anomalies. Even though such abnormalities cannot be ruled out based on the abdominal examination alone, this patient's presentation and the absence of significant abdominal findings (e.g., abdominal mass, guarding, distention) make cyclical vomiting syndrome very likely.",

He was sweating profusely during the episode and did not lose consciousness. He remembers having felt a chill down his spine before the episode. Following the episode, he experienced weakness in the right arm and was not able to lift it above his head for 2 hours. Three weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved with over-the-counter medication. He was born at term and his mother remembers him having an episode of jerky movements when he had a high-grade fever as a toddler. There is no family history of serious illness, although his father passed away in a motor vehicle accident approximately 1 year ago. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 94/54 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, electrolytes, calcium, and creatinine are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The rapid, irregular, and nonstereotyped movements of Sydenham chorea are usually generalized (involving the head, neck, and limbs) and continuous while the patient is awake, worsening over hours to days. Motor symptoms may be associated with impaired motor control, muscle weakness, and/or hypotonia. While the patient's history of a sore throat 3 weeks ago should raise suspicion of rheumatic fever, the timing of the appearance of the motor disturbance (< 1 month after sore throat), the cessation of the movement after 2 minutes, its restriction to a single limb, and the lack of other criteria suggestive of rheumatic fever make the diagnosis of Sydenham chorea unlikely.",

However, while the patient did have sudden movements of his arm during the described episode, its duration of minutes rather than seconds, the complexity of the movement, the preceding “chill\" (rather than an urge), and the subsequent transient paresis of the affected limb are not consistent with a tic disorder.",

Criteria for diagnosis include clinical evidence that the symptom cannot be explained by other neurological conditions, making functional neurological symptom disorder a diagnosis of exclusion.

        "explanation_why": "A migraine may be accompanied by an aura of both positive and negative focal neurologic symptoms such as visual disturbances, paresthesias, or pareses, which usually develop gradually (> 5 minutes) but last no longer than 1 hour and are by definition completely reversible. Hemiplegic migraines specifically are defined by the presence of motor weakness as the manifestation of the aura. Migraines may also be preceded by prodromes occurring 24–48 hours prior to the beginning of the headache, which may include complex experiential symptoms such as depression and euphoria. While this patient did experience a feeling of a “chill down his spine” prior to the episode and subsequent reversible paresis of his arm, he did not experience the headache that is central to the diagnosis of migraine with aura, nor the associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia. Moreover, the timing of the prodrome and the development and duration of his paresis are not consistent with a migraine aura.\n\nSome patients with migraines may experience aura without an associated headache, also known as a silent migraine, migraine equivalent, or acephalgic migraine. However, this is relatively uncommon, and the majority of patients with hemiplegic migraine have headache with each attack.",

Focal seizures may arise in the setting of hippocampal sclerosis, infection, trauma, or perinatal injury, among others. The majority of affected patients also experience an aura, with higher cortical sensations such as déjà vu and fear that precede the focal seizure. This patient experienced violent, jerky arm movements preceded by a “chill down his spine” and followed by temporary focal paresis without residual effects (Todd paralysis) upon presentation to the emergency department, which is consistent with the diagnosis of a focal seizure without impairment of consciousness, previously referred to as a simple partial seizure.",

Patients may also appear to have short palpebral fissures and hypertelorism due to epicanthal folds (pseudohypertelorism). However, patients with Down syndrome also typically have other manifestations, such as upslanting palpebral fissures, low-set ears, a short neck, furrowed protruding tongue, abnormal dentition, and a transverse palmar crease, which are all absent in this patient. A flat philtrum, thin upper lip, and microcephaly suggest a different cause of this patient's findings.",

Although patients with Williams syndrome typically manifest with facial dysmorphism (“elfin facies”), which may include midfacial hypoplasia and short palpebral fissures, some facial features differ from those seen in this patient (e.g., wide forehead, periorbital fullness, long philtrum, and dental hypoplasia). Patients with Williams syndrome do commonly have supravalvular aortic stenosis, which could result in a systolic heart murmur. In contrast to this patient, who has difficulty with social interactions, patients with Williams syndrome classically have an overfriendly demeanor and lack stranger anxiety.",

Acute kidney injury is common in heat stroke and is caused by both dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, which manifests with increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase.

Five months ago, his grandfather, whom he was very close to, passed away from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He used to enjoy playing soccer but quit his soccer team last week. When he comes home from school he goes straight to bed and sleeps for 11–12 hours each night. He previously had good grades, but his teachers report that he has been disrespectful and distracted in class and failed an exam last week. He tried alcohol twice at a party last year and he has never smoked cigarettes. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, he avoids making eye contact but cooperates with the exam. His affect is limited and he describes an irritable mood. He is easily distracted and has a difficult time focusing for an extended conversation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Heavy substance use and subsequent intoxication and withdrawal may cause an unstable mood with depression and irritability. However, this patient's substance use history is very mild, so it would not explain his current presentation.",

The 4 criteria not present in this patient are depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness or disproportionate guilt, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and suicidality. In children and adolescents, the depressed mood may be less marked and MDD may resemble attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which manifests with difficulties concentrating and irritability.\n\nThe first-line treatment in moderate to severe adolescent MDD is either psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) or pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine.",

Full criteria for other psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder, are typically not met.

Additionally, they have to show mood reactivity (i.e., their mood brightens in response to positive events), which clearly differentiates atypical depression from major depressive disorder. While this patient presents with hypersomnolence, he rather has decreased appetite and shows no leaden paralysis, which makes this diagnosis unlikely.",

She has had a 7-kg (15-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. The patient states that she should try to lose more weight because she does not want to be overweight anymore. She maintains a diary of her daily calorie intake. Menarche was at the age of 13 years, and her last menstrual period was 3 months ago. She is on the high school track team. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. She is at the 50th percentile for height and below the 5th percentile for weight and BMI. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 58/min and blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg. Examination shows fine hair over the trunk and extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Weight loss is achieved intentionally either through reduced food intake and/or excess physical activity (restrictive type) or by vomiting or laxative abuse (binge-eating/purging type). Severe complications include refeeding syndrome, osteoporosis and stress fractures, electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Anorexia nervosa is also associated with other psychological conditions (e.g., depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders) and a higher rate of suicide.\n\nThe most important acute therapeutic measure is a stepwise increase in food intake to counteract life-threatening cachexia. Long-term treatment involves ensuring the patient's stable condition through psychotherapy and education.",

Most of this patient's features (female, adolescent, fear of gaining weight, electrolyte imbalances) fit the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN). Patients with binge eating/purging type AN are particularly likely to induce weight loss by vomiting, which can result in perimolysis and bilateral salivary gland swelling. The key feature that excludes AN in this scenario is the patient's weight. She has a normal BMI, whereas individuals with AN are significantly underweight (i.e., BMI < 18.5 kg/m^2 or < 5^th percentile for sex and age).\n\nSome individuals meet all of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN) except for low body weight despite significant weight loss (e.g., patients with a history of overweight who do not yet meet the threshold for underweight). These individuals are often diagnosed with atypical AN. This patient has gained weight since her last well-child visit, making this diagnosis unlikely.",

However, this patient has no history of long-term steroid use and presents with lanugo hair rather than hirsutism. She also lacks other findings of Cushing's syndrome such as weight gain, easy bruising, sleep disturbances, decreased libido, abnormal fat accumulation, stretch marks, and/or acne (due to androgen excess). Furthermore, the moon-like facies in Cushing syndrome results from extra fat tissue build-up at the side of the face rather than from enlarged parotid glands.",

His teachers reported that he does not listen to their instructions, often talks during class, and rarely completes his school assignments. He does not sit in his seat in the classroom and often cuts in line at the cafeteria. His foster mother reports that he runs around a lot inside the house and refuses to help his sister with chores and errands. He frequently interrupts his foster mother's conversations with others and talks excessively. She has found him trying to climb on the roof on multiple occasions. He was placed in foster care because of neglect by his biological parents 3 years ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Mental status examination shows a neutral affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, in ASD this is rather due to deficits in social‐emotional reciprocity and developing and maintaining relationships and not due to impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention, as seen in this patient. Moreover, the absence of additional symptoms of ASD, such as impaired language competence and nonverbal communication, cognitive deficits (or exceptional skills in a certain field), aberrant sensory perception, insistence on sameness, and restricted, stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, makes the diagnosis unlikely. In addition, symptoms of ASD usually appear within the first 2–3 years of life.",

Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms must be present before the age of 12 years, in at least two different settings (e.g., school and at home), and for more than 6 months to an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for the child's level of development. Common comorbidities include conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depression, anxiety disorder, substance abuse, and/or learning disorders. Management of ADHD is multimodal and typically consists of stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) in combination with behavioral and school-based interventions.\n\nAssessment of hearing is important in children with suspected ADHD, since children frustrated due to hearing impairment may act out similarly to patients with ADHD.",

Since this girl's father has a history of drug abuse, unintentional contact with these substances should be considered. However, symptoms would typically have an acute onset, would not last for two months as in this girl, and would be different in character (e.g., perception of unusual colors).",

Signs of abuse and neglect can be subtle and history findings of parental drug use should certainly raise concern for the child's well-being. Although patients, particularly following sexual abuse, can develop hallucinations, these hallucinations commonly cause distress rather than comfort as in this patient. Additionally, this patient's age-appropriate milestones, the absence of signs of physical abuse, and the fact that she attends preschool regularly make child maltreatment less likely.",

Children typically get along with these friends (e.g., consider them “their best friend”) and the imaginary figures do not cause any distress or impaired functioning. Parents should be reassured. Further evaluation is only indicated if the imaginary friends persist beyond early school age, or if the child's general behavior or development changes.\n\nStress factors such as the parent's divorce can cause various behavioral responses in different age groups. Preschoolers such as this girl often display magical thinking and may believe that their actions caused the divorce. They can subsequently develop unusual or odd behaviors in the hope of reconciling their parents. Parents should be advised to reassure the child that their actions had no influence on the decision to get a divorce. A counselor can assist if problems persist.",

She reports that since he started preschool 10 months ago, he has not been able to concentrate on any tasks lasting longer than a few minutes. His preschool teachers report he is more active compared to other preschoolers, frequently interrupts or bothers other children, and is very forgetful. He was born at term via vaginal delivery and has been healthy except for 3 episodes of acute otitis media at the age of 2 years. He has met all developmental milestones. His mother has major depressive disorder and his father has Graves disease. He appears healthy and well nourished. On examination, the patient turns his head briefly toward the examiner and sometimes makes eye contact when spoken to but does not respond to direct questions and continues to play with and touch objects in the physician's office. He interrupts his mother and the physician frequently during the examination to express his wish to go outside and eat a snack. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

Behavioral therapy is most successful when guided by parents or guardians; for this reason, behavioral parent training is recommended for all parents of children with ADHD.

As for DMDD, extreme irritability, anger, and severe recurrent angry outbursts (verbal or behavioral) in more than one setting are the findings required for diagnosis.

She does not complete her assignments and does not listen to her teachers' instructions. She refuses to talk to her parents or peers. Her mother says, “She ignores everything I say to her!” She prefers playing alone, and her mother reports that she likes playing with 5 red toy cars, repeatedly arranging them in a straight line. She avoids eye contact with her mother and the physician throughout the visit. Physical and neurological examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This patient's trouble communicating, inattentiveness, refusal to speak and make eye contact, fixation on and intense attachment to certain objects (red toy cars), and repeated actions are all behaviors typically seen in patients with ASD. While the exact cause of ASD is unknown, twin studies strongly suggest a genetic predisposition.\n\nTreatment of ASD, which should be initiated early, involves educational and behavioral management (e.g., competence training for social skills and communication skills), family counseling, and medical therapy (e.g., SSRIs for repetitive stereotyped behavior).",

Chorea movements are generally unpredictable and arrhythmic or nonrepetitive, while tic movements due to Tourette syndrome are generally repeated and stereotypical. Furthermore, HD is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease that typically manifests at the age of 40 years. Childhood onset is rare and this patient does not have a family history of HD.",

Her father reports that her symptoms seem to improve with concentration and worsen when she is tired. During the past 3 months, her symptoms have become so severe that she has missed many school days. She also has too much anxiety about her involuntary movements to see her friends and prefers staying home in her room. Her birth and development until 18 months ago were normal. The father has bipolar disorder. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows intact higher mental function and thought processes. Neurologic examination shows multiple motor and vocal tics. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?",

        "explanation_why": "Guanfacine and clonidine are alpha-2 adrenergic agonists commonly used for managing tics (e.g., in Tourette syndrome) in children and adolescents, especially in those with comorbid ADHD or anxiety. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists have a more favorable side effect profile than dopamine receptor antagonists like haloperidol and aripiprazole. Additional treatment options include topiramate and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors such as tetrabenazine, but there is limited evidence to support their use. Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) is recommended in all patients with functional impairment, and pharmacotherapy is warranted when tics significantly interfere with daily functioning or if CBIT alone is ineffective.",

    "question_text": "A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of worsening grades over the past year. Since she started high school one year ago, her academic performance has decreased. She also has had difficulty finding friends at the new school. She is afraid that her classmates will make fun of her and think that she is “stupid.” One month ago, when she had to give a presentation, she could not stop worrying about how her classmates were going to react if she said something wrong. During the presentation, her heart started racing and she became flushed. Since this event, she has avoided saying anything in class. She spends her breaks in the restroom because she is worried that nobody will talk to her. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the girl avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",

His mother reports that in the last 2–3 years of high school, her son has spent most of his time in his room playing video games. He does not have any friends and has never had a partner. He usually refuses to attend family dinner and avoids contact with his siblings. The patient states that he prefers being on his own. When asked how much playing video games means to him, he replies that “it's okay.” When his mother starts crying during the visit, he appears indifferent. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. On mental status examination, his thought process is organized and logical. His affect is flattened. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Individuals with schizoid personality disorder neither desire nor enjoy close relationships. They show little interest in interpersonal or sexual contact and often appear indifferent or emotionally cold towards others (see “Overview of cluster A personality disorders” table). Of note, the DSM-5 states that personality disorders can be diagnosed in patients < 18 years of age if features have been present for ≥ 1 year. The only exception to this rule is antisocial personality disorder, which can only be diagnosed in patients ≥ 18 years of age.\n\nPersonality disorders are characterized by pervasive, inflexible, and maladaptive patterns of relating to and perceiving one's self and one's environment that cause significant distress and/or functional impairment. These patterns typically arise during early adolescence, remain stable over time, and are difficult to treat. Treatment options include psychoeducation, psychotherapy, dialectical behavior therapy, group therapy, and/or cognitive therapy.",

He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon.” Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact.

Although this patient prefers to be alone and has odd beliefs, he does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, as he has no clear delusions or hallucinations and no disorganized speech.\n\nThis patient's laborious speech is not the same as disorganized speech. Laborious speech is nonfluent speech that requires excessive effort and lacks spontaneity, but the thought processes and the contents of the speech are intact. On the other hand, disorganized speech results from disorganized thought processes and can manifest as loose associations (illogical, sudden, and frequent changes of topic), word salad (sequence of words without a logical connection), and flight of ideas (quick succession of thoughts), none of which are evident in this patient.",

    "question_text": "Twenty-four hours after delivery, a 2888-g (6-lb 6-oz) male newborn is not feeding well, has a high-pitched cry, and is diaphoretic. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated, which provides only minimal improvement in his symptoms.

He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated, which provides only minimal improvement in his symptoms. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this newborn?",

    "hint": "This neonate, whose mother has a history of opioid use, presents with gastrointestinal symptoms (poor feeding), flu-like symptoms (sweating, fever), and CNS stimulation (high-pitched crying, irritability, hyperreflexia, tremors) within 24 hours of birth. These features are associated with opioid withdrawal and suggest a diagnosis of neonatal abstinence syndrome.",

        "explanation_why": "Management of neonatal abstinence syndrome includes supportive care (e.g., swaddling, IV fluids, reduced sensory stimulation), which is often sufficient in infants with mild symptoms. In moderate to severe cases (e.g., inability to sleep or feed, severe diarrhea with dehydration) or if supportive treatment is unsuccessful, as seen here, opioid replacement is indicated to treat the withdrawal and ensure that infants can gain weight. First-line pharmacological treatment options include oral morphine, buprenorphine, and methadone. Second-line treatment includes phenobarbital and clonidine.",

Her teachers describe her behavior as uncooperative and disruptive as she persistently refuses to answer questions, insults her teachers, and deliberately distracts her classmates. At home, her parents try to address her frequent violations of curfew but attempts to discuss the issue often result in their daughter losing her temper and screaming at her parents. Her grades have deteriorated over the past year. When listening to music or hanging out with friends, she is calm and pleasant. She has no history of psychiatric illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities.

Difficulties sustaining attention can lead to an increased rate of mistakes and a deterioration of academic performance. However, unlike this child who defiantly refuses to answer questions, children with ADHD have difficulties controlling their impulse to talk and tend to answer out of turn.

The frequency of this behavior, more than once per week, goes beyond what is normative for children of her age. Furthermore, the ≥ 6-month duration of symptoms fulfills the diagnostic criteria for ODD.\n\nIndividuals with ODD are negatively impacted in numerous areas important for normal functioning (e.g., social, educational, occupational), and the hostility they express is toward individuals within their immediate social circle (e.g., family members, peers, work colleagues, teachers). Therefore, peer group support and peer-mediated interventions, alongside psychotherapy, parent management training, and social-skills programs, are pivotal in treating ODD.",

The condition is usually self-limited. Sharp/potentially harmful objects should be kept away from the bedroom of the patient. Benzodiazepines may be helpful in refractory cases.",

She has temper outbursts six to seven times per week, which last anywhere between five minutes and half an hour. According to her father, she screams at others and throws things in anger “when things don't go her way”. He says that she is constantly irritable between outbursts. She has been suspended from school three times in the past year for physical aggression toward her classmates, but her grades have remained unaffected. She appears agitated and restless. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, ADHD does not result in temper tantrums, physical aggression, or pervasive irritability. Instead, patients with ADHD have features of hyperactivity (e.g., difficulty remaining seated, talking excessively) and/or a decline in academic performance due to inattention (e.g., failure to complete activities that require sustained effort, increased frequency of careless mistakes).",

However, the episodes of verbal or physical aggression in a conduct disorder are usually premeditated unlike the impulsive aggression in this child. Moreover, the patient's mood would not be persistently negative (irritable, angry) in between the episodes of verbal or physical aggression, and a history of deceitfulness, aggression toward people or animals, and/or theft would also be present.",

The parents report that their son has been bullying several classmates at school over the past year. During this period, he has been accused twice of stealing items from a local store. He has also beaten up the neighbor's son for no obvious reason. The parents state that they had to give up their dog for adoption after finding out that their son was torturing him. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He attends a local middle school and his performance at school is poor compared to his classmates. He often forgets to do his homework and argues with his teachers. He was also caught smoking cigarettes. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. He has poor attention and does not answer some of the questions. For questions he answers affirmatively about his actions, he sometimes replies, “So what?” Which of the following conditions is this patient most likely to develop?",

The mother reports that over the past 6 months, her daughter has had frequent mood swings. Sometimes, she is irritable for several days and loses her temper easily. In between these episodes, she behaves normally, spends time with her friends, and participates in gymnastics training twice a week. Her mother has also noticed that her daughter needs more time than usual to get ready for school. Sometimes, she puts on an excessive amount of make-up. One month ago, her teacher informed the parents that their daughter had skipped school and was seen at the local mall with one of her classmates instead. The patient reports that she often feels tired, especially when she has to wake up early for school. On the weekends, she sleeps until 1 pm. Menses have occurred at 15- to 45-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years; they are not associated with abdominal discomfort or functional impairment. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's behavior?",

Her teachers complain that she does not answer their questions and it is affecting her academic performance. She was born at 35 weeks' gestation and pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia. Previous well-child examinations have been normal. Her older brother was diagnosed with a learning disability 4 years ago. She is at 65^th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. She follows commands. She avoids answering questions directly and instead whispers her answers to her mother, who then mediates between the doctor and her daughter. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Affected children show a consistently withdrawn behavior toward caregivers, express minimal emotion toward others, and do not seek comfort when distressed.

Pediatric patients should be informed that confidentiality may be breached for their own safety. In most cases of suicidal ideation in a child, the parents and/or guardians must be informed. The decision to hospitalize or discharge a patient depends on the outcome of the risk assessment, which should include determining access to lethal means (e.g., firearms, medications) and social support. Hospitalization is indicated for patients who have a concrete plan to end their lives or other high-risk features of suicide (e.g., lack of social support, access to a firearm). Patients with suicidal ideation but no concrete plan can be discharged and treated in an outpatient setting as long as there is a good support system. Discharge planning should include lethal means counseling. Ideally, firearms should be removed from the home. If removal is not possible, firearms should be stored locked and unloaded and placed out of reach of children, and ammunition should be stored in a separate locked location.",

He reports a persistent fear of “catching germs” from his fellow students and of contracting a deadly disease. He finds it increasingly difficult to attend classes. He avoids handshakes and close contact with other people. He states that when he tries to think of something else, the fears “keep returning” and that he has to wash himself for at least an hour when he returns home after going outside. Afterwards he cleans the shower and has to apply disinfectant to his body and to the bathroom. He does not drink alcohol. He used to smoke cannabis but stopped one year ago. His vital signs are within normal limits. He appears anxious. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person, place, and time. In addition to starting an SSRI, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Delayed sleep phase disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder characterized by bedtimes that are delayed by two or more hours as compared to social norms. Onset typically occurs in adolescence and is more common in male individuals. Because this patient delays bedtime until 2 AM and wakes up early for school, he experiences daytime sleepiness due to insufficient sleep. On weekends, he does not have to wake for school and gets sufficient sleep, which eliminates daytime drowsiness. Treatment of delayed sleep phase disorder requires a multimodal approach that includes nonpharmacological measures such as adherence to sleep hygiene, exposure to morning light, and avoidance of bright light in the evenings. In addition, pharmacotherapy (e.g., melatonin) can be used.\n\nAlthough a shift in the sleep-wake cycle is normal in adolescence, a pronounced delay accompanied by significant daytime dysfunction suggests delayed sleep phase disorder.",

The parents report that they have noticed an increasing number of hairless patches on their daughter's head. The patient denies any itching. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient states that she has been feeling tense since her boyfriend broke up with her. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows irregular patches of hair loss and hair shafts of varying lengths, with no scaling or reddening of the scalp. Further examination shows poor growth of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Androgenetic alopecia (AA) can occur at puberty in male individuals. In female individuals, however, it occurs at menopause, when estrogen levels decline and testosterone levels increase. AA may also occur in young women if an underlying hyperandrogenic condition exists (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting ovarian tumors). In such cases, signs of virilization (e.g., hirsutism, acne, irregular menses) will be present in addition to the characteristic tiny vellus hairs in the areas of hair loss. AA does not cause hair loss of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The location and pattern of hair loss and the absence of signs of virilization in this patient make the diagnosis of AA unlikely.",

Although the skin in the hair loss patches may also appear normal in scarring alopecia (since destruction and fibrosis of hair follicles occurs below the surface of the skin), more often than not there are signs of inflammation (e.g., redness, scaling, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation). The key differentiating feature is that the condition is not associated with hair of different lengths.",

In telogen effluvium, the telogen (i.e., resting) phase of hair growth predominates, resulting in premature shedding of the resting hair and diffuse, nonscarring hair loss. Physical examination typically shows a diffuse decrease in hair density rather than the patchy hair loss with hair shafts of varying lengths seen here.",

Unlike in obsessive compulsive disorder, individuals with TTM do not experience obsessive or intrusive thoughts. TTM typically manifests in late childhood or early adolescence and is more common in female individuals.

She reports that her coffee tasted “strange” this morning. After breakfast, she then saw a black car drive by the house, which she concludes must have been her ex-husband, who also drives a black car. She says that since the divorce 3 years ago, her ex-husband has been seeking revenge and thinks that he has installed cameras in her apartment to spy on her and their son. She has never seen any of these cameras but when she is alone in the apartment, she can sometimes hear them beeping and feel them recording her. The son also reports his mother's coffee mug smelled of bitter almonds, which he suspects was cyanide. He agrees with the mother's distrust towards his father and reports that he has also occasionally heard a camera beeping but has not been able to find any cameras yet. The mother's vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows a pH of 7.4. Toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

His mother recently returned to work 2 weeks ago. She explains that, since then, her son has had a tantrum roughly every other morning, usually when she is getting him dressed or dropping him off at daycare. He cries loudly for about 5 minutes, saying that he does not want to go to daycare while thrashing his arms and legs. According to the daycare staff, he is well-behaved during the day. In the evenings, he has tantrums about twice per week, typically when he is told he must finish his dinner or that it is time for bed. These tantrums have been occurring for about 6 months. The mother is concerned her son may have a behavioral disorder. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the boy's behavior?",

        "explanation_why": "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by extreme irritability, anger, and severe recurrent outbursts of temper (verbal or behavioral) for ≥ 12 months that also impair normal daily functioning. However, as the daycare center reports that the child is well-behaved during the day, normal functioning cannot be seen as impaired, and as such disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be diagnosed at this point.",

She does not have any friends, spends most of her time alone in her room, and does not feel comfortable around other people. She usually wears long cloaks and large, unusual hats. She wears her shoes to bed because she sleepwalks and claims “nargles” will try to steal them otherwise. Her father is concerned about her going to college because she was bullied in high school. At the end of last year, her father found her putting up posters around the school asking for her possessions to be returned, as the other students had been hiding them. The daughter seemed unconcerned though, saying that “it's all in good fun.” On mental status examination, she seems dreamy and avoids eye contact, but doesn't appear embarrassed about being addressed. Further evaluation discloses no disturbances in thought process, thought content, or perception. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, GBS does not typically cause involuntary limb movements or cognitive defects. Moreover, patients with GBS usually have ascending muscle weakness (unlike this patient with 5/5 limb strength in all extremities) and CSF albuminocytologic dissociation (CSF cell counts > 50/mm^3 make GBS unlikely).",

Moreover, poor social skills (e.g., reduced eye contact), repetitive/stereotyped behavior, and fixated interests suggest a different diagnosis.",

He also has trouble falling asleep at night and asks to sleep in the same room with his parents every night. He has not had fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss. He sits very close to his mother and starts to cry when she steps out of the room to take a phone call. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "This patient's abdominal pain on school days and his attachment to his mother suggests a disorder that also manifests with nightmares of losing an attachment figure.",

        "explanation_why": "Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, and/or avoidance of separation from attachment figures, and it may manifest with physical symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain), emotional distress (e.g., crying when a parent leaves the room), and functional impairment (e.g., school absences) lasting ≥ 1 month. This condition typically occurs during childhood in response to a stressful life event, such as attending a new school. Treatment options include individual psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, play therapy) and/or family therapy.",

This patient, however, presents with a 6-month history of stable, crampy abdominal pain that is only present on school day mornings, making IBS an unlikely diagnosis.",

He was born at 40 weeks' gestation at 2514 g (5 lb 9 oz) to a 28-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, by an uncomplicated cesarean section. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. The infant's temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 170/min, and blood pressure is 71/39 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are most likely due to maternal use of which of the following?",

Neonates exposed to alcohol during pregnancy may develop fetal alcohol syndrome, which manifests with cardiac and facial malformations not seen in this patient. Similarly, exposure to phenobarbital during pregnancy increases the risk of developing a cleft palate. Neither drugs cause the high-pitched cry or autonomic instability seen in this patient.",

In infants with mild opiate withdrawal symptoms, supportive care (e.g., swaddling, IV fluids, quiet room) is preferred. For infants with more severe symptoms, as seen in this infant, administration of oral morphine is recommended to treat the withdrawal.",

Of note, the DSM-5 states that personality disorders can be diagnosed in patients < 18 years of age if features have been present for ≥ 1 year. The only exception to this rule is antisocial personality disorder, which can only be diagnosed in patients ≥ 18 years of age.\n\nSee “Overview of cluster A personality disorders” table.",

The left ventricular obstruction in HOCM, however, typically results in a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur rather than a mid-to-late systolic murmur, which is heard in this patient. Moreover, the combination of hypothermia, bradycardia, low body weight, and dry, scaly skin suggests a different diagnosis.",

MVP may, in turn, predispose individuals to arrhythmias and syncope. However, hypothyroidism typically manifests with weight gain despite poor appetite.

While this patient has features of dehydration (e.g., dry mucous membranes, hypotension), which is an independent risk factor for heat exhaustion, her low core body temperature rules out heat exhaustion. Moreover, patients with heat exhaustion or dehydration are typically tachycardic.

        "explanation_why": "Performance athletes (e.g., marathon runners) have been known to misuse stimulants such as amphetamines. An acute amphetamine overdose can cause loss of consciousness due to seizures or arrhythmias. Chronic amphetamine use can result in low body weight (due to appetite suppression), irritability, and features of dilated cardiomyopathy, such as an apical, systolic murmur due to functional mitral regurgitation (MR). The murmur associated with MR, however, is typically holosystolic. Moreover, an acute amphetamine overdose usually manifests with tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia rather than bradycardia, hypotension, and hypothermia, which are seen here. While tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia may be absent in the case of chronic use as a result of drug tolerance, chronic amphetamine use would not explain this patient's dry, scaly skin or anemia.",

Excessive exercise is commonly seen in this disorder. In addition to low body weight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m^2), severe caloric restriction leads to a variety of clinical features (e.g., hypothermia, secondary amenorrhea, osteoporosis, dry skin, pancytopenia, electrolyte abnormalities), some of which are seen here. Cardiovascular manifestations include sinus bradycardia, mitral valve prolapse, and hypotension, all of which can lead to syncope.

Bradycardia, which can lead to lightheadedness and syncope, may be a sign of increased intracranial pressure due to an intracranial tumor (e.g., brain metastases). However, this patient does not have other features that suggest increased intracranial pressure, such as altered mental status, headache, and/or blurry vision. The presence of hypothermia, dry, scaly skin, and an apical systolic murmur suggest a different diagnosis.",

Severe marantic endocarditis, which can be caused by adenocarcinomas, can also cause an apical murmur if the mitral valve is affected.

While driving down a residential street, a young boy ran out in front of her, chasing after a ball. She applied the brakes of her vehicle and avoided hitting the boy, but then she suddenly experienced generalized weakness that rendered her unable to operate the vehicle and collided at low speed with a parked car. One minute later, she recovered her strength. She was uninjured. She has had several similar episodes of transient generalized weakness over the past month, once during an argument with her mother and another time while watching her favorite comedy movie. She has also had excessive daytime sleepiness for 18 months despite 9 hours of sleep nightly and 2 daily naps. She has fallen asleep in class several times. She often sees intensely bright colors as she is falling asleep. During this time, she is often unable to move; this inability to move is very distressing to her. Which of the following is the most appropriate nighttime pharmacotherapy for this patient?",

Most cases of SJS develop within 2–8 weeks of initiating the offending medication. The risk of developing SJS induced by lamotrigine therapy is greatest when high doses are used, so the initial dose should be low and increased slowly. In addition, about 10% of patients treated with lamotrigine develop a benign skin rash that is difficult to differentiate from early SJS; accordingly, all patients should be advised to discontinue lamotrigine therapy at the first sign of a rash. Other commonly implicated triggers of SJS include allopurinol, sulfamethoxazole, sulfa drugs, and phenobarbital. Other antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and ethosuximide, can also cause SJS but are less frequently implicated than lamotrigine.",

    "question_text": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his behavior. Yesterday, he was expelled from school for repeatedly skipping classes. Over the past 2 months, he was suspended 3 times for bullying and aggressive behavior towards his peers and teachers. Once, his neighbor found him smoking cigarettes in his backyard. In the past, he consistently maintained an A grade average and had been a regular attendee of youth group events at their local church. Three months ago, the boy's father discovered that the mother was having an affair and moved out of the house; the mother first noticed these changes in the boy's behavior around that time. Which of the following defense mechanisms best describes the change in this patient's behavior?",
    "content_preview": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his behavior. Yesterday, he was expelled from school for repeatedly skipping classes. Over the past 2 months, he was suspended 3 times for bullying and aggressive behavior towards his peers and teachers. Once, his neighbor found him smoking cigarettes in his backyard. In the past, he consistently maintained an A grade average and had been a regular attendee of youth group events at their local church. Three months ago, the boy's father discovered that the mother was having an affair and moved out of the house; the mother first noticed these changes in the boy's behavior around that time.

The patient stopped going to swim class due to “feeling uncomfortable in swim trunks.” The patient's mother, who is accompanying the patient, reports that her child has been wearing her dresses at home and asks to be called Lilly. Since starting puberty about a year ago, the patient has stayed at home most of the time, only rarely meeting friends. The patient's academic performance has been poor for the last year despite having maintained an A average the year before. The mother further reports that her child has had mainly female friends since preschool and never enjoyed playing with “typical boy toys like cars” but instead preferred playing with dolls. The patient appears shy and in a depressed mood. Physical examination shows normal male external genitalia. There is scarce coarse, dark axillary and pubic hair. Upon questioning, the patient says “I am trapped in a male body. It just doesn't feel right to be a boy.” Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "This child shows signs of sexual abuse, for which a well-documented patient interview is often the most important piece of evidence. In over 90% of cases, the perpetrator is an individual known to the child or their family. Therefore, it is important to interview the child separately from the parent to allow for a neutral and honest conversation. Furthermore, girls aged 9–12 years are at increased risk for sexual abuse. Behavioral changes that should raise concern for sexual abuse include sexually acting-out, sexual remarks that are inconsistent with age, problems at school, aggression, regression (e.g., nocturnal enuresis), eating or sleep disturbances, and depression. Medical conditions that should raise concern for sexual abuse include sexually transmitted infections (e.g., condylomata acuminata), pregnancies, recurrent urinary tract infections, and anogenital or oral trauma.\n\nThe threshold for investigating any suspected case of child abuse should be very low. The patient interview is followed by a careful physical examination and screening for STIs. Subsequently, the physician must notify Child Protective Services to protect the safety of the child and to ensure further investigation (including a forensic interview).",

Last week, he was caught smoking marijuana outside a mall by the police. Over the past year, he has been suspended from school 3 times for bullying younger classmates, stealing his friend's wallet, and breaking the windows of the school cafeteria. He says that his classmates deserve to be bullied “because they are wimps.” He is a high school sophomore, and his performance at school is poor. His teachers report that he regularly loses his temper and often skips classes. When asked about his school performance, he responds, “My classes are so lame. I would much rather hang out with my friends.” His mother says, “He is such a troublemaker. I don't know what to do with him anymore.” On mental status examination, attention and concentration are poor. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

During early childhood, the disorder more commonly affects boys, whereas after puberty there is an equal incidence in boys and girls. While aggression and resistance in children with ODD are caused by the feeling of being controlled, this patient shows behavior that violates the rights of others (e.g., bullying, theft, and destruction of property), which is a diagnostic criterion for a different disorder.",

Peak age of onset is 14–17 years. While this disorder usually causes the affected individual significant distress, this patient shows no feelings of remorse, regret, or embarrassment following his outbursts. Moreover, some of this patient's behaviors, including theft and truancy, are not explained by this diagnosis.",

Individuals typically develop this behavior before age 10. Outbursts occur several times per week, but affected individuals remain persistently irritable in between. Unlike other causes of irritability, DMDD tantrums are not situation-dependent or episodic. Although this patient frequently loses his temper and argues with teachers, he does not fulfill the criteria for this disorder. DMDD also does not account for behavior that violates the rights of others (e.g., bullying, theft, and destruction of property), which is seen in this patient.",

To make the diagnosis, the disturbance in behavior must last at least 12 months and significantly impair social, academic, or occupational functioning, as is the case in this patient. CD typically presents during childhood or adolescence but may persist beyond 18 years of age and result in antisocial personality disorder. It may be preceded by oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Risk factors for developing CD include genetic, psychological, and social factors (e.g., family instability). CD is also associated with adolescent drug use (e.g., marijuana).

Last week, when his teacher asked him to present his homework in class, he started shouting and cursing and threw a book on the floor. The teacher has reported that similar outbursts occur at least twice weekly for no apparent reason; otherwise, he is usually calm and sits quietly during class. His mother reports that during driving lessons he regularly becomes angry “if other people drive too slowly”, and that has led to him almost losing control of the car. After these episodes, he feels embarrassed and apologizes for his actions. When asked about his behavior in these situations, he says, “I feel a sudden rage inside of me, my mind is racing, and I can feel my heart pounding.” His mother is concerned that he may not be able to get his driver's license if he cannot control himself. He is otherwise healthy, takes no medications, and does not use illicit drugs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Moreover, the onset of ODD symptoms typically occurs during late preschool or elementary school, and symptoms must be present for ≥ 6 months to make the diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient most likely has intermittent explosive disorder. The diagnosis is established in patients ≥ 6 years of age who present with recurrent aggressive outbursts (followed by feelings of remorse and/or embarrassment) ≥ 2 times weekly for 3 months without injury to others or destruction of property, as seen here. Alternatively, diagnosis is established if the outbursts occur ≥ 3 times a year with injury to others or destruction of property. The peak age of onset for intermittent explosive disorder is 14–17 years. Treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy (e.g., SSRIs). Affected individuals are at increased risk for self-harm and may continue to experience aggressive episodes throughout life.\n\nA urine toxicology screen should be obtained to rule out drug-induced etiologies of aggression. For children 6–18 years of age in whom a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder is suspected, adjustment disorder should also be excluded.",

Moreover, to make a diagnosis of ADHD, symptoms must be present before 12 years of age and include ≥ 5 features of hyperactivity (e.g., restlessness, excessive talking, answering questions prematurely, difficulty waiting, interrupting others) and/or ≥ 5 features of inattention (e.g., poor attention, disorganization, forgetfulness, distractibility, avoidance of tasks that require high mental effort).",

    "question_text": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because he has been making unusual movements for several years. Recently, he started blinking more frequently for no apparent reason. In the past, he would repeatedly twist his neck, often for several minutes at a time. He has also been copying gestures and sounds that others do since 6 years of age. She reports that the movements worsen when he is tired. When asked about the blinking, he says, “Sometimes I suddenly feel like I must blink and, when I do, I feel much better.” He does not take any medications and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 80^th percentile for height and weight. On physical examination, the boy continues to blink excessively. The conjunctiva is clear and pupils are equal and reactive to light. When the physician asks the boy to keep his eyes open, the blinking subsides. During the examination, the boy repeats some of the words of the physician at increasing speed, but he is otherwise alert and oriented. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

TS characteristically has a waxing and waning nature, with exacerbation of symptoms occurring during times of stress or fatigue. Tics are commonly preceded by an urge or sensation that is relieved by the tic itself and are often suppressible. Management includes counseling for the patient and caregivers and behavioral therapy, including Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) and habit reversal training. Pharmacotherapy is indicated in severe or refractory cases and includes alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., guanfacine, clonidine), first-generation neuroleptics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine), second-generation neuroleptics (e.g., risperidone), and dopamine depleters (e.g., tetrabenazine). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an alternative therapy reserved for patients with severe, distressing tics refractory to behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy.",

The father reports that the pain typically occurs in the morning before she goes to kindergarten. He has also had to bring her home early from kindergarten several times because of similar episodes. He says that her symptoms are not related to any specific type of food and he has not noticed any change in her appetite, toilet use frequency, or stool and urine appearance. He also reports that she often has nightmares of him dying and frequently asks him to stay in her bedroom until she falls asleep. There is no personal history of serious illness and she takes no medications. Her mother died four months ago in a motor vehicle collision. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She is at the 50^th percentile for weight and 75^th percentile for height. There is no decline in the percentiles of her anthropometric measurements since her previous well-child visit. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her mood and affect are normal. She confirms a history of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain when interviewed separately. A serum test for IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Stool test for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement by the physician to the father regarding the management of his daughter's condition?",

It is important to schedule follow-ups for individuals with somatic symptom disorder to establish a therapeutic alliance. However, in this condition, symptoms do not typically have a diurnal pattern (e.g., abdominal pain in the morning and in kindergarten) and nightmares are uncommon.

However, pathological grief is characterized by a persistent yearning for and preoccupation with the deceased (in children often expressed through themes of play), which this patient does not have. Moreover, in children, pathological grief is diagnosed only when the grieving process persists beyond 6 months; this patient's symptoms started only 2 months ago. Finally, this patient would be too young for CBT, as this therapy is appropriate only when cognitive development is more mature (generally over 7 years of age).",

This patient's abdominal pain is most likely psychogenic and related to her other symptoms (nightmares, anxiety if her father is not near her).

        "explanation_why": "Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is characterized by a consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward caretakers, which is consistent with this patient's behavior of never crying or smiling and her minimal response to comfort when distressed. Patients with RAD also show minimal social responsiveness to others, which is reflected in this child's lack of involvement in cooperative play with other children. Repeated changes in foster care limit the opportunity to form selective attachments and are a risk factor for this condition. Other risk factors include child abuse and neglect. The diagnosis of RAD can only be made in children who are developmentally able to form selective attachments (i.e., at least 9 months old) and features of RAD must be evident before 5 years of age.",

Social withdrawal and isolation, which can manifest as a lack of social interaction with peers, can also be present. However, selective mutism does not manifest with signs of detachment from caregivers and a restricted affect, which is evident in this patient's behavior of never crying or smiling near her primary caretakers. Moreover, this patient has no history of refusing to speak in specific social situations.",

However, this patient's behavior of never crying or smiling, minimal response to comfort when distressed, and lack of involvement in cooperative play is the opposite of that expected in DSED, instead demonstrating a pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward caregivers and peers.",

The parents report that she has been crying excessively since the last visit and are concerned that she is not well. Their babysitter has told them that she does not stop crying even with feeding or burping. They say that she used to be calm when she was left alone, but over the past week, she starts to cry whenever they leave the room. She was exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age. Her parents have gradually introduced semisolid foods over the past three months. She is at the 75^th percentile for height and weight. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, she turns her head when her name is called. She coos “ma” and “da.” She crawls on the examination table, is able to independently get into a seated position, and passes a teddy from one hand to the other. She can be pulled up to stand but cannot stand without support. Plantar reflex is present bilaterally. The anterior fontanelle is soft. She begins to cry when the physician picks her up. The remainder of the examination does not show any abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

For the past year, he has been setting mail boxes on fire in their neighborhood. Three months ago, he brought a box of matches to school and threatened to burn down a classroom. His father says, “We've tried everything, but he won't listen to us anymore. The last straw was when he broke into someone's car yesterday and stole a laptop!” The patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. His older brother has bipolar disorder. The patient does not smoke cigarettes. He drinks one to three beers on weekends. He has experimented with cocaine but has never used intravenous drugs. On mental status examination, he has an angry mood and anxious affect. He is fully oriented. He does not have hallucinations or delusions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, DMDD is not associated with violation of the rights of others (e.g., theft, destruction of property). Additionally, DMDD is usually associated with trouble functioning due to persistent irritability between episodes of aggression, which is not the case in this patient. Moreover, individuals with DMDD typically develop disruptive behavior before 10 years of age, whereas this patient's behavior began at 15 years of age.",

        "explanation_why": "The diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder (CD) include aggression (e.g., arguing with parents, threatening others) and certain criminal behaviors (e.g., destruction of property and theft) with severe rule violations, all of which are seen in this case. To confirm a diagnosis of CD, the disturbance in behavior must persist for ≥ 12 months and significantly impair social, academic, or occupational functioning. CD typically manifests during childhood or adolescence and may be preceded by oppositional defiant disorder. Individuals with CD are at risk for developing antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and should be assessed for ASPD when they reach 18 years of age.\n\nRisk factors for developing CD include genetic (e.g., positive family history), psychological (e.g., child neglect), environmental (e.g., exposure to toxins), and social factors (e.g., family instability). The first-line treatment for CD involves psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, parental training). Patients with severe aggression might also require pharmacotherapy (e.g., risperidone).",

He did not use any word combinations until 28 months of age and has been using descriptive words incorrectly since he started speaking. He appears well. He is at the 35^th percentile for height and 47^th percentile for weight. His vital signs are within normal limits. During examination, he undresses and dresses himself independently and draws a person with a head, body, arms, and legs. He can count to ten. His speech is 100% intelligible but his vocabulary is restricted for his age. He pronounces single words clearly and speaks in sentences of 2–3 words without interruptions. Audiometry and visual acuity test show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Patients with SSD also have partially or completely unintelligible speech because they add or delete certain sounds or syllables from a word and substitute or distort one or more sounds (e.g., “I wend to the dark, and I ate ith eam” instead of “I went to the park, and I ate ice cream.\").",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Language disorder (LD) usually develops in early childhood. Its key features are reduced vocabulary for age, incorrect understanding of a word's meaning, limited ability to string words together to form complete sentences, and/or incorrect grammar use. These features impair the patient's ability to speak and write (expressive LD) as well as understand (receptive LD), which leads to irritability and frustration, reluctance to engage in conversations, inability to follow instructions without visual cues, and, eventually, difficulties in social participation and academic performance. The diagnosis is typically confirmed after the age of 4 years, at which point children should have a vocabulary of approx. 1500 words, be able to form 4–5 word sentences, and use certain grammatical structures (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, tense) correctly. In patients with language disorder, speech fluency is unaffected and speech remains intelligible. Other aspects of social and cognitive development are not delayed (e.g., dressing oneself, counting to ten, drawing a person with a head, body, arms, and legs by the age of 5 years).\n\nIf a caregiver, parent, or teacher has any concerns about a child's speech or language development, the child should be evaluated for developmental communication disorders (e.g., language disorder, speech sound disorder, childhood-onset fluency disorder, pragmatic communication disorder), specific learning disorders (e.g., dyslexia), autism-spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and hearing impairment. Treatment of communication disorders consists of speech and language therapy.",

However, patients with ASD also have stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior and interests by the age of 2–3 years and have difficulty engaging in nonverbal communication (e.g., maintaining eye contact, understanding social cues). In addition, this patient shows social-emotional reciprocity, a feature often absent in patients with ASD, when he enjoys playing with another child or becomes frustrated in response to not being understood.",

    "question_text": "A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician for an adolescent wellness examination. She feels well. She plays on her high school's softball team, performs well in school, and gets along with her friends and family. Medical history is unremarkable, and the patient takes no medications. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is not sexually active. Vaccinations are up-to-date. Growth and development are appropriate for age. Vital signs are within normal limits. During physical examination, the physician notices a 1-cm sized hypopigmented macule on the dorsal surface of the left forearm. When the physician inquires about the lesion, the patient says that she burnt herself using a friend's cigarette butt 2 months ago. She says that she does not know why she did it and that her parents do not know about the lesion because she has been covering it with long-sleeved clothing. She says that she has not harmed herself before this incident or since then. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation, hallucinations, or delusions. Her thought process and speech are organized. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient asks the physician not to tell her parents about the skin lesion. In addition to exploring the reasons for the patient's request, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as intentional self-injury to the surface of the body (e.g., cutting, burning, scratching) without suicidal intent and is commonly seen in adolescents. The severity and frequency of the self-injury and the presence or absence of suicidal ideation or other psychiatric comorbidities determine how NSSI is managed.",

        "explanation_why": "If information about a patient who is an adolescent has to be disclosed to their parents, this should be reviewed and discussed openly with the patient beforehand. In the case of NSSI in an adolescent, the physician can respect the patient's wish to refrain from disclosure to the parents if there is no reinforced behavioral pattern (e.g., a single episode that was not done to cope with distress), the injury is nonsevere, and there is no suicidal ideation, psychiatric comorbidity, or functional impairment.",

Disclosing NSSI to the patient's parents depends upon the physician's judgment but is usually not needed if there is no reinforced behavioral pattern, the injury is nonsevere, and there is no suicidal ideation, psychiatric comorbidity, or functional impairment. Regardless of the presence or absence of NSSI, anticipatory guidance should be provided at every adolescent wellness examination; for adolescents aged 15–17 years, topics of discussion during anticipatory guidance include emotional well-being, coping with stress, living situation, relationship with the family, school performance, substance use, sexual activity, and personal safety.",

She reports that for almost a year, he has been episodically “acting out” by stomping his feet and screaming at home. She says that she sometimes scolds him during these episodes in an attempt to correct his behavior, but his tantrums have become worse and more frequent over time. According to his teachers at preschool, he is calm and plays cooperatively. He was born at term and has been healthy since. He can draw a square, hop on one foot, and brush his teeth. He can identify several colors and numbers and occasionally tells stories to his parents. He enjoys being read stories before bedtime, and he sleeps 11 hours every night and 1–2 hours during the day. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40^th percentile for both height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The mother is worried that his behavior will continue when he starts kindergarten next year and asks if it would be appropriate to gently spank her son to discipline him. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for responding to the boy’s behavior?",

        "explanation_why": "Taking away the child's favorite toy after he has a tantrum is an example of negative punishment. Although punishment may be effective in older children and adolescents when coupled with rewards for good behavior, it is not effective for decreasing unwanted behavior in preschoolers. Moreover, while punishment may result in a temporary decrease in unwanted behavior, it does not typically lead to behavior extinction.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Ignoring the child (e.g., by putting them on time-out) is one of the most effective approaches for a preschooler who is having a temper tantrum. Although ignoring the child may initially result in a temporary increase in the behavior, this approach eventually leads to extinction by eliminating any positive reinforcement of the behavior. If using a time-out, the parent should briefly explain to the child that the time-out is related to their temper tantrum. No other communication (e.g., scolding, teaching) should take place during a time-out. Physical punishment is largely ineffective and strongly discouraged because it can cause physical harm. Some forms of physical punishment are considered child abuse under state and federal laws. Physical punishment can also have deleterious effects on the child's psychosocial development, e.g., by teaching them that violence is an appropriate means of conflict resolution.\n\nWhile this is a developmentally normal behavior in preschoolers, health care providers should evaluate children with temper tantrums for conditions that can cause or contribute to tantrums (e.g., hearing and/or visual impairment, learning disabilities).",

He previously went 1 year without wetting the bed. The mother reports that she and her husband have been monitoring their son's voiding habits over the past month. He passes stool of normal color and consistency approximately once daily and voids his bladder 5–7 times per day. He drinks little during dinner and before going to bed. They have not noticed any urgency, hesitancy, straining, postmicturition dribble, or episodes of urinary incontinence during the day. The patient says that he has no pain in his abdominal or genital region prior to, during, or after voiding. He recently started primary school and says he enjoys it. He is able to balance and hop on one foot, tie a knot, name 6 colors, and dress with minimal assistance from his parents. He is at the 50^th percentile for height and weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Pica is associated with multiple risk factors including stress, nutritional deficiencies (e.g., iron), low socioeconomic status, mental health disorders, child neglect, and pregnancy. Behavioral therapy (e.g., differential reinforcement, cognitive behavioral therapy) is the treatment of choice. For patients with refractory symptoms, pharmacotherapy (e.g., SSRIs) may be considered. All patients with pica should be screened for iron deficiency and lead poisoning. Pica is a risk factor for lead poisoning. For patients with mildly elevated blood lead levels (i.e., < 45 μg/dL), addressing risk factors for lead poisoning (e.g., by treating pica) and limiting lead exposure by removing the source (e.g., paint, furniture, water, toys, soil, dust, secondhand exposure) suffices. Chelation therapy (e.g., with oral succimer) is only recommended in children with a blood lead level > 45 μg/dL.",

His symptoms worsen when he is tired or stressed. His teacher reports that he frequently uses obscene language in class and gets into fights with his friends because he insults their physical appearance. Growth and development are appropriate for age. His only medications are acetaminophen and metoclopramide, which he takes occasionally for fever or nausea. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. During the examination, he says the physician is “stupid and ugly.” The patient frequently jumps and twists his body from side to side on examination. Excessive blinking occurs while at rest. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely clinical course of this patient’s condition?",

This condition typically improves during adolescence, and most affected individuals experience no tics or only mild tics by early adulthood.\n\nTreatment consists of nonpharmacological interventions, such as comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) and habit reversal training. Pharmacotherapy with antidopaminergic drugs, alpha-adrenergic drugs, or neuroleptics is indicated if behavioral interventions are unsuccessful.",

Common features of Huntington disease such as sensory deficits (e.g., clumsiness), dementia, and/or autonomic symptoms (e.g., hyperhidrosis, urinary incontinence) are not seen here.

His mother says the patient has had difficulties with speech from an early age. He often refuses to wear shoes, repetitively flaps his hands, and is easily startled by certain sounds. She says his teacher reports that he mostly plays by himself, which consists of lining up toy trucks. Medical history is remarkable for functional constipation. His only medication is polyethylene glycol as needed. He is at the 60^th percentile for height, the 55^th percentile for weight, and the 88^th percentile for head circumference. He does not respond to the physician's questions but occasionally looks at the objects that the physician points to and uses physical gestures to show interest in objects. Hearing and vision tests show no abnormalities. Which of the following factors in this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?",

For adolescents who are legally unable to provide informed consent, their agreement to participate in treatment (informed assent) should be obtained whenever feasible. In this case, in which an adolescent’s wishes conflict with their parents’ preferences, it is important to preserve the therapeutic relationship and address the adolescent’s growing desire for autonomous decisions. The clinician should first have a private discussion with the patient (i.e., without parents present) about the patient's rationale for stopping treatment and their understanding of the risks and benefits of this decision. Subsequently, the physician should facilitate a discussion between the patient and parents and attempt to mediate a consensus. This should be done even when the mature minor doctrine applies, because ideally, the patient would continue to allow his parents to play a significant role in deciding whether or not he continues any form of medical treatment. It is, however, appropriate to temporarily halt treatment that is not urgent or life-sustaining until such a discussion can take place.",

While this patient presents with irregular movements of the face (facial grimacing, rapid blinking, throat clearing), these features are more consistent with tics. In addition, this patient also has obsessive-compulsive symptoms (frequent handwashing) that are not sufficiently explained by Sydenham chorea. Moreover, Sydenham chorea typically manifests 1–8 months after untreated streptococcal pharyngitis, whereas this patient's symptoms appeared three weeks after infection.",

He also frequently experiences episodes of sudden, brief shoulder jerks several times per day. These movements increase when he is anxious and are sometimes accompanied by vocal outbursts, such as grunting. He is performing well academically but has become self-conscious around classmates. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. His maternal uncle has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. On physical examination, the patient repeatedly clears his throat, grimaces, and shrugs his shoulders. The rest of the examination shows no abnormalities. Brain MRI shows reduced caudate nuclei volume. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?",

This approach involves increasing the patient's awareness of premonitory urges and training them to perform voluntary, competing responses when they feel tics coming on. Early behavioral intervention can reduce tic frequency and social consequences, and is preferred due to its safety and efficacy. Pharmacotherapy (e.g., guanfacine, haloperidol, tetrabenazine) is reserved for severe tics that cause functional impairment and/or when behavioral interventions fail.\n\nTourette syndrome is characterized by both motor and vocal tics persisting for over a year, often exacerbated by stress or anxiety. MRI typically shows reduced caudate nucleus volume, reflecting dysfunction in cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits.",
