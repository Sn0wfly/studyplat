Loss of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and DCC results in the malignant transformation of an adenoma to carcinoma.

Hypoventilation results in hypercapnia (↑ P_aCO_2) due to decreased CO_2 elimination and hypoxemia (↓ P_aO_2). The alveolar gas equation dictates that the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (P_AO_2) would also be decreased due to an increase in P_aCO_2. Since both P_AO_2 and P_aO_2 are decreased, the A-a gradient is usually within normal limits (5–10 mm Hg). An overdose of benzodiazepines, which increase the frequency of chloride channel opening, or opiates, which close presynaptic Ca^2+ channels and open postsynaptic K^+ channels, could also cause central hypoventilation and similar ABG findings.",

Physical examination shows decreased breath sounds and dullness on percussion above the right lower lobe. An x-ray of the chest shows a right lower lobe density and a small amount of fluid in the right pleural space. The patient's symptoms improve with antibiotic treatment, but he develops right-sided chest pain one week later. Pulmonary examination shows new scratchy, high-pitched breath sounds on auscultation of the right lobe. Microscopic examination of a pleural biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

This accounts for increased skin laxity and rigidity. Atrophy of the dermis due to loss of collagen and volume deficit as a result of reduced glycosaminoglycan synthesis further contribute to the appearance of chronologically aged skin. Moreover, aging skin is prone to xerosis secondary to moisture loss resulting from diminished lipid and sebum production at the surface.",

Since GAGs maintain skin structure and moisture, decreased synthesis results in loss of volume and hydration, as well as the development of wrinkles and folds. Moreover, a decrease in fibroblast activity contributes to delayed wound healing.",

This deletion leads to a misfolded CFTR protein that is unable to reach the cellular membrane. The CFTR protein is an important chloride channel in cell membranes, and when mutated cannot properly secrete intracellular chloride ions. This mutation causes exocrine glands to produce hyperviscous secretions that accumulate and damage different organs, mainly the lungs and pancreas.",

Chloride and sodium are normally in equilibrium, but the accumulation of intracellular chloride due to the absence of a transporter results in the retention of intracellular sodium and water (due to osmosis). This ultimately results in hyperviscous mucus, which causes blockages of small organs and airways, inflammation, and end-organ damage.",

The spleen is not palpable. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 2,000/mm^3, and platelet count is 80,000/mm^3. Serum LDH and unconjugated bilirubin concentrations are elevated. Addition of a serum containing anti-human globulins to a blood sample shows no agglutination. A urine dipstick shows blood; urinalysis shows no RBCs. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a thrombus in a distal branch of the superior mesenteric vein. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

        "explanation_why": "Activation and consumption of platelets and coagulation factors is a characteristic of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), an acquired coagulopathy that is frequently seen in hospitalized individuals. DIC may manifest with fatigue, jaundice, hematuria, LDH elevation, venous thrombosis, and a negative Coombs test, which are seen in this patient. However, clinical features of DIC also involve bleeding manifestations (e.g., petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses), which are not seen here. Additionally, DIC usually appears following sepsis (acutely), trauma, or malignancy (subacutely) and would not cause pancytopenia.",

        "explanation_why": "Endothelial cell dysfunction triggered by bacterial toxin production promotes vasoconstriction and platelet microthrombus formation. These occlude the arterioles and capillaries, resulting in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, the hallmark of hemolytic uremic syndrome. In HUS, RBCs are mechanically destroyed as they pass through the platelet microthrombi, resulting in hemolysis and end-organ ischemia. Affected patients present with thrombi, hematuria, fatigue, pallor, jaundice, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH, and a negative Coombs test, all of which are seen in this patient. However, HUS is mostly seen in children and manifests after diarrheal illness with petechiae, purpura, or mucosal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. This patient's large-vessel venous thrombosis and pancytopenia are not characteristic of HUS.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The absence of GPI anchor proteins CD55 and CD59, which are factors on stem cells protecting against complement destruction, is the physiological hallmark of PNH. In this condition, RBCs are especially sensitive to destruction by complement complexes, which causes intravascular hemolysis (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH), manifesting with jaundice and hemoglobinuria (dark urine). Complements also destroy leukocytes and thrombocytes, causing pancytopenia. Due to RBC destruction, less nitric oxide (NO) is generated by RBCs, and the remaining NO is scavenged by free hemoglobin (a result of hemolysis). NO is a vasodilator that causes muscle relaxation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Therefore, a lack of NO induces painful smooth muscle spasm (abdominal pain), vasoconstriction, and platelet aggregation. The latter promotes venous thrombosis, typically in unusual locations (hepatic or portal vein). Venous thrombosis formation is a severe complication and often leads to death in PNH.",

A bone marrow biopsy showing hyperplastic myelopoiesis indicates chronic myeloid leukemia. This is supported by low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity, a distinct feature of CML that distinguishes it from all other forms of leukemia.",

It is caused by a reciprocal translocation that leads to fusion of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 with the BCR gene on chromosome 22, resulting in Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22). The newly formed BCR-ABL fusion gene encodes a BCR-ABL non-receptor tyrosine kinase with increased enzyme activity.

Absence of decompensated liver failure features (e.g., jaundice, ascites) in this patient suggests that her parkinsonian features have a different pathogenesis.",

This condition can manifest with seizures and progressive neurodegeneration with brain atrophy. However, NPD is typically associated with hypotonia (not hypertonia), a cherry-red spot on the macula on fundoscopic examination (rather than optic disc pallor), interstitial lung disease, and hepatosplenomegaly, none of which is seen here. Moreover, globoid cells on brain biopsy are not a feature of NPD.",

Further symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, axial hypotonia, absent reflexes, and microcephaly.

This mechanism of edema development can also be due to other inflammatory conditions, metastasis, trauma, or lead poisoning.\n\nThe patient's behavioral change (putting the fork, salt shaker, and coffee can lid in his mouth) is characteristic of hyperorality, a finding in Kluver-Bucy syndrome.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis that primarily affects the axial skeleton (e.g., spine, sacroiliac joint) rather than the small joints of the hands. In the other seronegative arthritides, the distal joints are most commonly involved but are affected asymmetrically (in contrast to this patient, who has symmetrical arthropathy). Moreover, this patient does not have psoriatic lesions or a history of recent genitourinary infection to suggest a diagnosis of these other seronegative arthritides.",

Accumulation of iron in the joints leads to articular damage and promotes calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition; the metacarpophalangeal joints are classically involved. Deposition in the liver leads to hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, and increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, which is the most common cause of death in patients with HH.
