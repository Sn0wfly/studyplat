PDA is usually an acyanotic congenital condition because most blood passes through normal circulation and thus sufficient oxygen saturation is maintained; only a small amount of blood is pumped through the PDA.

        "explanation_why": "Pulmonary vascular congestion seen on chest x-ray is a sign of left heart failure, with subsequent “backing up” of blood into the pulmonary vasculature, leading to enlarged pulmonary vessels. Although pulmonary vascular congestion is classically associated with congestive heart failure in adults (especially elderly patients), some congenital cardiac defects can also cause this finding (e.g., truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return). In TOF, there is a right ventricular outflow obstruction, leading to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature and, consequently, decreased pulmonary vascular markings on chest x-ray.",

The thickened myocardium in the right ventricle produces increased electrical activity, which shifts the axis of cardiac depolarization. TOF also involves an overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis. It is the most common congenital cyanotic heart lesion. In addition to these ECG findings, a chest x-ray showing a boot-shaped heart also supports the diagnosis. Echocardiography is used to confirm TOF.",

Also, patients typically have a history of bloody diarrhea (unlike this neonate, who has delayed passage of meconium), and the child would appear seriously ill with cardiopulmonary instability.

However, the small bowel would be distended (not the large bowel), since intussusception typically occurs at the ileocolic junction. Moreover, intussusception usually occurs between 5 months and 3 years of age; it is extremely rare in the neonatal period.

Parasympathetic neural crest cells migrate in a rostral to caudal direction, from the foregut to the midgut to the hindgut. Failure of the neural crest cells to complete this migration typically results in an aganglionic distal sigmoid and rectum (i.e., without the myenteric and submucosal plexus). As a result, there is hypertonicity in the walls of the rectum and sigmoid, and the internal anal sphincter fails to relax in response to rectal distention. The net effect is intestinal obstruction and dilation of the colon (megacolon). The diagnosis is confirmed via rectal biopsy, which would show aganglionosis, increased acetylcholinesterase activity, and/or hyperplasia of parasympathetic fibers.",

An abdominal ultrasound is readily available, cost-effective, and does not expose the patient to radiation. Typical findings of appendicitis include a noncompressible and distended appendix (> 6–8 mm), fluid around the appendix, and a target sign. Acute appendicitis is usually a clinical diagnosis, and imaging is not always needed if the patient presents with typical clinical features (e.g., migrating abdominal pain, RLQ tenderness, rebound pain, fever, leukocytosis). Given this patient's nonclassic presentation, inconclusive clinical examination, and family history of Crohn disease (which makes inflammatory bowel disease a possible differential diagnosis), abdominal ultrasound is indicated for further diagnosis.",

Testicular torsion is a medical emergency and is most likely to occur during the neonatal period and puberty. Twisting of the spermatic cord leads to venous engorgement, which may result in arterial compromise and irreversible damage if the torsion is not resolved within 6–12 hours. Manual testicular detorsion may be attempted if surgery is not available or for immediate pain relief prior to surgery.\n\nSee \"Differential diagnosis of scrotal pain\" table.",

In patients with testicular torsion, Doppler ultrasound typically shows twisting of the spermatic cord and reduced perfusion on the affected side. However, the diagnosis can be made clinically in patients with unequivocal findings (e.g., absent cremasteric reflex). Because of the risk for irreversible testicular damage, definitive treatment should not be delayed by further diagnostic workup.",

        "explanation_why": "This child is dehydrated as evident by dry mucous membranes, irritability, and hypotension (N in 4-week-old term infant = 85 ± 10 systolic: 46 ± 9 diastolic, mm Hg). Vomiting in hypertrophic pyloric stenosis causes dehydration with loss of hydrogen chloride and potassium chloride. The hypovolemia also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, which further worsens hypokalemia and causes the paradoxical aciduria, seen in this patient, as well as a contraction alkalosis (a chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis). The initial management of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis involves intravenous fluid therapy with 0.9% NaCl to correct the extracellular volume loss and replete chloride, thereby ensuring adequate chloride delivery to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Adequate chloride delivery to the DCT is necessary for the activity of the pendrin exchanger, which reabsorbs chloride in exchange for excreting bicarbonate into the lumen of the DCT. Correction of the volume status usually also corrects any mild electrolyte disturbances, but for moderate to severe electrolyte disturbances, it may be necessary to take further measures (e.g., repletion with potassium chloride for severe hypokalemia).",

Nephroblastoma is the fourth most common type of childhood cancer, accounting for ∼ 5% of all malignant childhood tumors. The tumor is most commonly an incidental finding on exam, without other signs or symptoms, but may manifest with abdominal pain and hypertension. Laboratory analysis should include a urinalysis, which typically shows hematuria. The best initial diagnostic test is an abdominal ultrasound, which can distinguish nephroblastoma from other abdominal tumors, showing a kidney mass of mostly uniform echogenicity with hypoechoic areas of necrosis. Abdominal CT or MRI is performed to assess the extent of involvement and to help with surgical planning.",

Abdominal x-ray may show the double bubble sign, although x-ray is primarily used to exclude bowel perforation. Abdominal ultrasound, although not routinely performed, may show a whirlpool sign rather than the target sign seen here.",

Hydrostatic enema is a viable alternative (the mechanism is the same, only normal saline is used instead of air).

        "explanation_why": "Appendectomy is the treatment of choice in acute appendicitis, which occurs rarely in the first year of life. Acute appendicitis may manifest with fever, vomiting, irritability, diarrhea, and tenderness and guarding of the abdomen. Ultrasound in appendicitis typically shows a dilated appendix with edematous walls. Appendicitis can mimic the target sign appearance of intussusception, especially in axial views, and if the appendix is already perforated. On longitudinal views, it is usually possible to differentiate intussusception and appendicitis, because the appendix is a blind-ending sac. Additionally, in axial views, the appendiceal lumen is usually filled with hypoechogenic fluid or debris, whereas the typical finding in intussusception is alternating echogenicity due to intussuscepted bowel mucosa.",

The majority of patients are asymptomatic, but if symptoms are present, hematochezia is the most common. The intussusception diagnosed in this child, especially in light of the reddish bowel movements, could indeed be the result of a Meckel diverticulum. However, regardless of the etiology of the intussusception, treatment needs to be initiated quickly and should not be delayed by further diagnostic studies.",

There is no leakage of amniotic fluid. Since arrival, she has had 5 contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting 70 to 90 seconds. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervix and a uterus consistent in size with a 38-week gestation. Ultrasound shows a single live intrauterine fetus in a breech presentation consistent with a gestational age of approximately 37 weeks. The amniotic fluid index is 26 cm (N = 10–20) and the fetal heart rate is 92/min. The placenta is not detached. She is scheduled for an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean delivery because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. The infant is delivered and APGAR score is noted to be 8 at 1 minute. The physician soon notices cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa, which does not resolve when the infant cries. The infant is foaming at the mouth and drooling. He also has an intractable cough. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Infants with esophageal atresia are usually unable to swallow during the prenatal period, which results in polyhydramnios. Placement of an oroesophageal or nasoesophageal tube is used for continuous suction of secretions and prevents aspiration. Oral feeding should not be attempted. Patients with esophageal atresia should receive surgical treatment within the first 24 hours of birth.",

He was born at term to a healthy 35-year-old woman following a normal vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, but the patient's mother had missed several of her prenatal checkups. The patient's older brother underwent surgery for pyloric stenosis as an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the left mid to lower sternal border. Abdominal examination shows a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen. There is no organomegaly. An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Although patients with DKA have high levels of serum glucose, the glucose cannot be transported into the cells. As a result, the cells undergo fatty acid metabolism with ketone acid production for energy generation, resulting in ketoacidosis (low pH).

        "explanation_why": "These values indicate hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with hyponatremia and hypokalemia, which is classically associated with persistent vomiting in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. In patients with prolonged vomiting (generally several days to a week), enough hydrochloric acid is lost from the stomach that the body can no longer compensate via renal (bicarbonate secretion) or respiratory (hypoventilation) mechanisms. As a result, chloride and hydrogen ion concentrations decrease, resulting in hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (increased pH). There are several mechanisms that can result in hypokalemia seen in such cases. For one, vomiting results in volume depletion and aldosterone secretion, which promotes renal potassium losses. In addition, hydrogen ions shift extracellularly to compensate for increased pH, while potassium ions shift intracellularly to maintain electroneutrality. The classic electrolyte pattern of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia is rarely encountered nowadays. Emesis is still the most common presenting symptom, but infants are usually diagnosed early, before significant symptoms, malnourishment, and electrolyte abnormalities develop.",

Meckel diverticulum is the pathological lead point that most commonly causes intussusception. Meckel diverticulum may contain ectopic gastric mucosal cells that secrete gastric acid and thereby lead to irritation and ulceration of the adjacent small bowel, which can cause occult gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.\n\nA technetium-99m pertechnetate scan can be used to diagnose Meckel diverticulum.",

Multiple dilated bowel loops (B) may alternatively be seen in jejunal atresia, and the number of loops may increase in conjunction with a more distal location of the atresia.1: gastric air-fluid level; 2: duodenal air-fluid level; 3: jejunal air-fluid level",

The mother reports that her son fell from a ladder while playing with friends about a month and a half ago. He had a runny nose 3 weeks ago. He has no history of serious illness. He has reached all developmental milestones for his age. His immunizations are up-to-date. His 7-year-old brother has asthma. The patient is at 60^th percentile for height and 65^th percentile for weight. He appears healthy. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a mild left-sided antalgic gait. The left groin is tender to palpation; abduction and internal rotation are limited by pain. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,800/mm^3, and platelet count is 230,000/mm^3. An x-ray of the pelvis shows a left femoral epiphysis that is smaller than the right with widening of the medial joint space on the left. The femoral head shows little discernible damage. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

She was born at term to a 26-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2. Pregnancy was complicated by a breech presentation for which she underwent an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean section. The newborn's head circumference is 35 cm (13.7 in). She is at the 60th percentile for length and 75th percentile for weight. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The spine is normal. Abduction of the right hip after cupping the pelvis and flexing the right hip and knee causes a palpable clunk. The feet have no deformities. Ultrasonography of the hip determines the angle between lines along the bone acetabulum and the ilium is 50°. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This newborn has a positive Ortolani sign (the clunk heard and felt on abducting her flexed hip), which suggests developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The sex of the child (female) and a breech presentation are risk factors for DDH. An alpha angle (angle between lines along the bone acetabulum and the ilium) of less than 60° on ultrasound also indicates DDH.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "In most infants, mild hip instability (e.g., the femoral head is subluxable) resolves spontaneously within the first 6–8 weeks of life, as growth of the femoral head and acetabulum reduces hip laxity. If mild hip instability is detected at neonatal screening, close observation, and repeat examination after 2–6 weeks are appropriate. However, in infants with clinical evidence of hip instability (e.g., the femoral head is dislocatable) and abnormal ultrasound findings, DDH is unlikely to resolve without treatment. These infants are at high risk of developing a functional disability and accelerated osteoarthritis in the course of their lives. Expectant management would therefore not be appropriate.",

Therefore, further maneuvers to reduce the hip are not needed. In infants with DDH older than 6 months, contractures develop around the hip joint and make hip abduction difficult. Closed reduction of the hip joint under general anesthesia would be indicated in such a scenario.",

The harness should be worn for at least 23 hours/day for 6–8 weeks. The type of abduction harness (rigid vs. nonrigid harness) used varies by region and institutional protocols.\n\nNonrigid harnesses (e.g., the Pavlik harness) are the most commonly used orthotic among patients with DDH, although recent evidence suggests rigid harnesses (e.g., von Rosen harness) are associated with better outcomes.",

The pain is aggravated when he runs. He had a runny nose and fever around a month ago that resolved with over-the-counter medications. He has no history of serious illness. His development is adequate for his age. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears healthy. He is at the 60^th percentile for height and at 65^th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an antalgic gait. The right groin is tender to palpation. Internal rotation and abduction of the right hip is limited by pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,900/mm^3, and platelet count is 170,000/mm^3. An x-ray of the pelvis is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

The underlying pathophysiology is multifactorial, poorly understood, and often described as idiopathic avascular necrosis. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease likely results from a combination of repetitive mechanical stress, microtrauma, and genetic predisposition. This patient should be treated nonsurgically with NSAIDs, physical therapy, and restriction of weight-bearing. Surgical treatment should be considered for children with extensive damage to the femoral head.\n\nSee “Common causes of hip pain in children” table.",

Lateral displacement puts a pathological strain on the femoral head when weight-bearing, which leads to deformities.\nD. Hinge abduction: On hip abduction, the deformed lateral pillar of the femoral head impinges on the acetabular rim, preventing the femoral head from entering the acetabulum. This results in a hinge joint articulation instead of a ball-and-socket joint articulation at the hip.",

Echocardiography shows pulmonary arteries arising from the posterior left ventricle, and the aorta rising anteriorly from the right ventricle. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Echocardiography findings are consistent with the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA): In TGA, the systemic circulation is disconnected from pulmonary circulation and venous blood that is received by the right ventricle is pumped to the rest of the body without being oxygenated. TGA is more commonly associated with infants born to diabetic mothers.",

        "explanation_why": "TGA results in rapidly worsening hypoxemia and cyanosis shortly after birth, and relies on a patent ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is kept patent in fetal circulation by the effect of low partial pressure of oxygen in fetal circulation, as well as by endogenously produced prostaglandin E. After birth, the ductus arteriosus begins to close in response to an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen. Intravenously administered prostaglandin E1 keeps the ductus arteriosus open and allows mixing of blood between the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This effect is crucial for initial survival of infants with TGA because it is the only way to maintain oxygenation of the arterial blood until surgical repair can be performed.",

During this period, he has vomited bilious fluid three times. He has not yet passed stool. The mother has breastfed the newborn every 2 hours. He has wet two diapers during the last 2 days. He was born at term and was delivered at home. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The mother had no prenatal care during pregnancy. The patient currently weighs 3100 g (6 lb 13 oz) and is 50 cm (19.6 in) in length. The newborn appears restless. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.14°F), pulse is 166/min, respirations are 60/min, and blood pressure is 70/45 mm Hg. There is no redness or warmth around the umbilical cord stump. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Bowel sounds are sparse. The abdomen is distended. Digital rectal examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the abdomen with contrast shows dilated small bowel loops, a microcolon, and a mixture of gas and meconium located in the right lower quadrant. A nasogastric tube is placed and fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This newborn presents with bilious vomiting, a distended abdomen, and sparse bowel sounds, all of which are consistent with bowel obstruction. The findings of dilated small bowel loops on abdominal x-ray and a microcolon indicate meconium ileus as the cause for obstruction and explains why he has not yet passed stool.",

        "explanation_why": "Reassurance with later follow-up would not be appropriate management for this infant who has several concerning symptoms including vomiting and inability to pass stool. Delayed treatment in an infant with symptoms of bowel obstruction may lead to dehydration, intestinal perforation, or meconium peritonitis. In this newborn, urgent management is warranted to prevent such complications.",

        "explanation_why": "Gastrografin enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic for meconium ileus. A gastrografin enema will allow visualization of the rectum and bowel to rule out other anatomical causes for bowel obstruction (e.g., intestinal atresia or volvulus) and, in the case of meconium ileus, can reveal the Neuhauser sign, microcolon, or meconium pellets. The contrast agent can also induce a laxative effect as the increase of osmolarity within the lumen of the bowel results in the breakdown and passage of the meconium obstruction.\n\nMore than 90% of patients with meconium ileus will have cystic fibrosis (CF). For unknown reasons, newborn screens for CF in patients with meconium ileus are often initially negative and require additional testing. Infants with meconium ileus should undergo diagnostic testing for CF through a sweat test or, if sufficient amounts of sweat cannot be obtained, through genotyping.",

This newborn does not have any free air on x-ray nor contrast leak that would suggest bowel perforation. He is hemodynamically stable and afebrile and his abdomen is distended, but there is no guarding or abdominal rigidity, which would suggest peritonitis, although these findings are unreliable in a newborn. This newborn should undergo nonsurgical management. Surgery would be considered only when meconium ileus is complicated or if nonsurgical treatment fails.",

He says that the pain worsens when he moves or walks. He participated in a dance recital yesterday, but his mother believes that he was not injured at the time. He was born at term and has been healthy except for an episode of nasal congestion and mild cough 10 days ago. His mother has rheumatoid arthritis and his grandmother has osteoporosis. He is at the 50^th percentile for height and 50^th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.6°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/78 mm Hg. His right hip is slightly abducted and externally rotated. Examination shows no tenderness, warmth, or erythema. He is able to bear weight. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 12.3 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 8500/mm^3, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 12 mm/h. Ultrasonography of the right hip shows increased fluid within the joint. X-ray of the hips shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Additionally, SCFE occurs most often in obese boys, and this patient is at the 50^th percentile for height and 50^th percentile for weight. Exam findings would also likely reveal external rotation along with flexion at the hip, not just external rotation and abduction. X-ray would show sclerotic epiphysis with joint widening when radiographic changes begin, but might be normal for the initial 4–6 months, meaning imaging alone is not enough to exclude SCFE in this patient.",

On exam, the right hip is slightly abducted and externally rotated, a common finding in patients with hip pain as this position decreases joint capsule tension and the resulting pain. Patients with TS typically present with no (or low-grade) fever and normal laboratory findings (e.g., normal WBC count and ESR). TS can manifest with unilateral or bilateral joint effusion on ultrasonography, unlike septic arthritis, in which joint effusion is almost always a unilateral finding.\n\nTS is a mild, self-limited disease and treatment is conservative with NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) and rest. If the effusion and/or the hip pain fails to resolve, follow-up imaging should be obtained to reassess for other conditions (e.g., Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease).",

This patient's tumor is in the fourth ventricle, which is the most common location for ependymoma in children and the last ventricle along the CSF pathway; as such, all ventricles become dilated with trapped CSF. Ependymomas typically appear as homogeneous enhancing masses on CT neuroimaging, often with cysts and calcifications. Ependymomas have a poor prognosis, especially when located in the posterior fossa. The next step in management for this patient would be a brain MRI to provide better images of the tumor.

The parents report that the patient does not appear to be in discomfort between episodes, and moves and plays normally. The episodes have occurred at roughly 15-minute intervals and have each lasted a few minutes before subsiding. He has also vomited 3 times since these episodes began. The first vomitus appeared to contain food while the second and third appeared pale green in color. The patient was born at term and has been healthy. His immunizations are up-to-date. He has no history of recent travel. His older brother has Crohn disease. The patient is at 50^th percentile for height and 60^th percentile for weight. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 85/40 mm Hg. During the examination, the patient begins to cry and draws his knees up to his chest. Shortly thereafter, he passes stool with a mixture of blood and mucus; the patient's discomfort appears to resolve. Abdominal examination shows a sausage-shaped abdominal mass in the right upper quadrant. Abdominal ultrasound shows concentric rings of bowel in transverse view. Intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

    "hint": "Acute cyclical abdominal pain with asymptomatic periods, vomiting (initially nonbilious), and currant jelly stool (composed of blood and mucus), together with a sausage-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant and target sign on abdominal ultrasound is consistent with intussusception.

        "explanation_why": "A CT scan of the abdomen can be used to better visualize intraabdominal structures and masses, including possible tumors. Moreover, a CT scan may show a target sign and help identify pathological lead points in patients with intussusception. Although this patient has a palpable abdominal mass, his young age and acute onset of symptoms make an intraabdominal tumor an unlikely diagnosis. Moreover, a CT scan should only be performed in patients with suspected intussusception if the diagnosis is unclear and other diagnostic procedures are inconclusive because radiation exposure in children should be avoided whenever possible.",

This scan uses a radioactive tracer that has a high affinity for gastric mucosa and is, therefore, able to identify Meckel diverticulum with high sensitivity and specificity. Ectopic gastric mucosa can secrete gastric acid within the diverticulum, possibly resulting in ileal ulceration and subsequent bleeding.\n\nThe sensitivity of technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is lower in adults because the adult population tends to have a higher percentage of Meckel diverticulum that lack ectopic gastric mucosa. False positives may be seen in intussusception and inflammatory bowel disease.",

The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but he often spits up or refuses to eat. He has not had a cough, fever, or bloody stools. The patient was born at term by cesarean delivery and had his first bowel movement 2 days after delivery. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50^th percentile for length, 10^th percentile for weight, and 40^th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "hint": "This newborn has features of Down syndrome and was noted at birth to have late passage of meconium, which raises concern for Hirschsprung disease (HD). The current symptoms of poor feeding and bilious vomiting, physical findings of abdominal distention and explosive stool release upon rectal examination, and the presence of a dilated colonic segment proximal to an empty segment on x-ray further support this diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "In adults, a CT scan of the abdomen is a common diagnostic test for patients with acute abdominal pain or severe abdominal distention. However, in children in general and even more so in newborns such as this boy at 3 weeks of age, CT scans should be avoided whenever possible because of the exposure to ionizing radiation and the significant risk of long-term complications (e.g., radiation-related cancers). Alternative imaging techniques such as ultrasonography and/or MRI are almost always preferred. Abdominal CT scans are not indicated for the diagnostic workup of HD.",

However, because the developing anorectal sphincter does not reach a stable resting pressure until approx. 1 month of age, anorectal manometry is not the best diagnostic test for this 3-week-old patient.

If the biopsy shows an absence of ganglion cells in an adequate tissue sample, HD is confirmed. A normal biopsy result taken from a correct site (i.e., 2 cm proximal to the dentate line) virtually rules out HD.\n\nIf HD is confirmed, the aganglionic segment of the colon is resected and anastomosed, either in a one-stage operation or, less commonly, as a two-stage surgery in which a diverting colostomy is performed to decompress the dilated bowel, followed by definitive anastomosis of the bowel loops.",

        "explanation_why": "Transnasal puncture and stenting are used to treat choanal atresia, a congenital condition. Bilateral choanal atresia usually manifests in infancy, whereas the unilateral form manifests later in life with chronic rhinitis of the affected nasal passage. The timeframe of this patient's symptoms makes bilateral atresia unlikely, however, and unilateral atresia does not typically manifest with foul-smelling or blood-tinged nasal drainage.",

        "explanation_why": "A foreign nasal body should be suspected in any young child with unilateral nasal discharge (most commonly seen in patients 1–5 years of age). The presence of unilateral symptoms can help rule out differential diagnoses, such as chronic rhinosinusitis or upper respiratory tract infection, which generally manifest bilaterally. The foreign object causes local inflammatory reactions, which can lead to foul-smelling nasal discharge, epistaxis, and may progress to secondary infection. Diagnosis is established via direct visualization of the foreign body via anterior rhinoscopy, or, if the foreign body is not visualized on anterior rhinoscopy, flexible fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy. Removal of the foreign body is first attempted through noninvasive techniques (e.g., positive pressure techniques). If unsuccessful, instrumentation techniques (e.g., extraction with forceps) may be necessary.",

Her 18-year-old sister has a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has been in remission for 11 years. The patient's temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination shows a 3 × 2 cm swelling on the left side, 4 cm below the base of the mandible and anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The swelling is soft and fluctuant. It does not move with swallowing, and forced exhalation against a closed glottis does not increase the size of the swelling. Ultrasound shows a round mass with uniform low echogenicity and no internal septations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

As in this patient, the majority (approximately 85%) of CDH cases are left-sided.\n\nFollowing intubation, a nasogastric tube should be placed for gastric decompression to decompress the stomach/bowel and reduce lung compression.",

As this ectopic tissue may be the patient's only functional thyroid tissue, ultrasonography should first be performed to evaluate the cyst architecture and its location in relation to functional ectopic or orthotopic thyroid tissue, to ensure that surgical excision of the cyst will not result in postoperative hypothyroidism. Thyroid function testing may be normal even if ectopic thyroid tissue is the only functioning tissue, but it may be useful if the thyroid gland has an abnormal appearance or is not visualized on ultrasound.",

Even if the brachial artery is not directly affected, local trauma can also induce brachial artery vasospasm, thus compromising arterial blood flow. Impaired brachial artery flow affects the distal structures supplied by this artery, so patients can have an absent or diminished radial pulse and delayed capillary refill in the affected arm. Most patients do not have a direct injury of the artery and treatment of the fracture (internal fixation) usually reduces entrapment and restores perfusion; vascular surgery is rarely needed.",

While rickets can cause the genu varum deformity, as seen in this patient, as well as the genu valgum deformity, the underlying vitamin D deficiency results in softening of all bones, which leads to delayed closing of the fontanelles, impaired growth (usually < 10^th percentile for height), and further bone deformities. This child has closed fontanelles and displays normal growth and development.",

Knee alignment becomes neutral at about 18–24 months of age and turns into a genu valgum deformity (knock-knees), which should resolve by age 7. This 21-month-old's development has been normal thus far, and he has met all the age-appropriate milestones. He has a normal gait and shows no signs or symptoms of an underlying pathological condition (e.g., unilateral deformity, abnormally short stature, fever, limb swelling). Reassurance and regular follow-up examinations are recommended to measure the intercondylar distance and to document the expected spontaneous resolution.",

However, meatal stenosis is most frequently acquired (e.g., secondary to circumcision) rather than congenital, making this diagnosis less likely.",

The treatment of choice is cystoscopy with primary valve ablation.\n\nThe presence of PUV can be detected via prenatal ultrasound, which usually shows a distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, hydronephrosis with marked vesicoureteral reflux, and megaureter, as well as oligohydramnios. In severe cases, the deficiency of amniotic fluid may lead to the development of the Potter sequence: pulmonary hypoplasia, craniofacial abnormalities, and limb anomalies.",

The bulge increases on crying and disappears when he is lying down. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation by lower segment transverse cesarean section. He has met all developmental milestones. He has been breastfed since birth. He appears healthy and active. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender, 1-cm midabdominal mass that is easily reducible. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

When the child tried to pull himself up on the dresser, it tipped and fell on his chest and abdomen. He had been awake and agitated at the scene and moved all extremities except for his right arm. On arrival, he is unconscious with rapid, shallow respirations. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 164/min and thready, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 68/35 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bony deformity of the right upper extremity and scattered ecchymoses over the chest and abdomen. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities except for tachycardia. The abdomen is distended with guarding and rebound tenderness; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Attempts to obtain venous access were not successful. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

However, this patient presents with signs of severe hypovolemia requiring immediate fluid resuscitation. Subclavian vein cannulation performed during emergencies is accompanied by a variety of complications such as hemothorax or pneumothorax. In addition, CVL insertion requires ultrasound guidance, which would consume valuable time in an emergency such as this. Lastly, since flow rates in CVLs are relatively low given the length of the catheter, a CVL is not the preferred access for emergency fluid resuscitation.",

However, obtaining peripheral venous access has already been attempted without success and the patient requires immediate fluid resuscitation. Particularly in pediatric trauma patients such as this one, peripheral IV access should be achieved within 60–90 seconds of arrival.

Greenstick fractures are inherently unstable, and there is a risk of further displacement without adequate immobilization. After initial care, follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon is indicated to assess for complications (e.g., refracture) and to ensure complete reunion.

Incomplete fractures are more common in children due to their thicker, stronger periosteum and the greater elasticity of growing bones. Types of incomplete fractures include:Buckle (torus) fracture: A compressive force results in bulging, i.e., buckling of the cortex. More specifically, a buckle fracture is characterized by bulging of only one side of the cortex (the concave side), while a fracture in which the bulge is circumferential is referred to more precisely as a “torus fracture.” However, the terms are frequently used interchangeably.Greenstick fracture: There is discontinuity of the cortex and periosteum on the convex (tension) side of the fracture, but bending occurs only on the concave (compression) side.Bowing fracture: There is angulation but no discontinuity of the cortex or periosteum.",

        "explanation_why": "This child presents with typical auscultation findings of an atrial septal defect (ASD) with the fixed (no change with respiration), widely split S_2 being the most specific. Right ventricular volume overload due to the left-to-right shunt across the ASD causes a delayed closure of the pulmonary valve relative to the aortic valve. Since the right and left sides of the heart communicate, the pressure difference that normally exists during respiration evens out; therefore, the duration of the split does not change with inspiration or expiration. The increased blood flow through the right side of the heart also causes a pulmonary flow murmur, which explains the patient's systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. Some patients with ASD can also have a soft, mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border secondary to increased flow across the tricuspid valve.",

Headache is caused by compression of the adjacent brain parenchyma and/or stretching of the dura mater, while visual field defects are the result of compression of the optic chiasm.

An additional finding is inferior rib notching (Roesler sign; examples indicated by arrowheads), which is produced by dilated intercostal arteries.The figure-3 sign of coarctation (indicated by red line) is seen in this patient. It is produced by prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery in combination with post-stenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The presence of bilateral rib notching indicates that the coarctation is distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries.",

In noncritical CoA, the left ventricular outflow obstruction leads to myocardial hypertrophy and increased collateral blood flow (e.g., to the intercostal arteries); rib notching occurs as a consequence of the collateral circulation between the internal thoracic and intercostal arteries and is usually a late finding (typically after 5 years of age).\n\nDoppler echocardiography is the confirmatory test of choice and should be performed in all patients with suspected CoA. It can identify the location and extent of the stenosis and show concurrent anomalies, such as a bicuspid aortic valve (present in ∼ 60% of patients).",

This patient most likely has noncritical, non-ductal-dependent CoA as there is no history of differential cyanosis. In patients with noncritical CoA, the blood flow to the lower extremities, although reduced, is typically enough to maintain normal arterial oxygen saturation and, therefore, tissue oxygenation.

His parents report that he has been healthy except for an episode of tonsillitis 3 months ago treated with penicillin. The patient was born at term by a lower segment transverse cesarean delivery because of a transverse lie. He has met all developmental milestones. His immunizations are up-to-date. The patient is at the 50^th percentile for length, 50^th percentile for weight, and 95^th percentile for head circumference. He appears well-nourished. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tense anterior fontanelle. The eyes deviate inferiorly and the eyelids are retracted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality in newborns and young infants in whom the anterior fontanelle is still open because it allows direct visualization of the brain. Moreover, ultrasound does not involve radiation and does not require sedation of the patient.\n\nAlthough standard MRI is safe for infants, sedation is required, making it less appropriate than ultrasonography. Ultra-fast MRI techniques, however, do not require infant sedation and can be used as an alternative to ultrasonography. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in older children in whom the anterior fontanelle has closed (it usually closes at 12–18 months of age).",

He has been increasingly irritable over the past month, has been feeding poorly, and has had multiple episodes of vomiting. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 50^th percentile for height, 40^th percentile for weight, and 98^th percentile for head circumference. He appears lethargic. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a bulging anterior fontanelle. The child is unable to stand without support and falls if he attempts to walk. Muscle tone is increased and deep tendon reflexes are 4+ in the lower extremities. Examination of the back is unremarkable. An MRI of the brain shows symmetrical enlargement of all four ventricles.

The absence of eschar in this patient's burn and the fact that it is tender make it more likely that he has a partial-thickness burn. Although he may still require antibiotics eventually, topical antibiotics would not be the most appropriate next step in management.",

It dilutes and removes the offending agent from the skin. Irrigation should be continued until the pH of the affected tissue has become neutral, which may take several hours in case of alkaline burns.\n\nThe only exceptions to this rule are burns caused by elemental metals (e.g., potassium, magnesium) and dry lime. In these cases, adding water can cause a chemical reaction that would worsen the burn; mineral oil should be used instead.",

However, in contrast to this patient's abdominal mass, nephroblastomas do not cross midline and tend to be smooth rather than irregular. Additionally, nephroblastoma would not explain the elevated catecholamine metabolite levels seen here, nor would it cause abnormal eye and foot movements.",

Further features include failure to thrive, hypertension, and fever, as well as opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, which explains the patient's twitching feet and erratic eye movements. Although neuroblastomas can originate from any aggregation of sympathetic nervous tissue, > 60% arise in the abdomen, as seen in this patient. The characteristic diagnostic finding is elevated urine catecholamine metabolites (homovanillic and vanillylmandelic acid). Treatment is based upon the extent of disease, age at diagnosis, and the presence/absence of N-myc amplification, and usually involves a combination of chemotherapy and surgical excision.",

He was born at 38 weeks' gestation following spontaneous vaginal delivery. His mother received no prenatal care. He was 51 cm (20 in) in length and weighed 3660 g (8 lb 1 oz) at birth. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Examination following delivery showed no abnormalities, and he was discharged at the age of 2 days. Today, he is at the 20th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 190/min, respirations are 60/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96% and breathing appears labored. Examination shows no cyanosis, but a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the left lower sternal border. ECG shows left-axis deviation. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged left atrium and ventricle and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Doppler echocardiography confirms the presence of an intracardiac shunt. The development of this patient's current symptoms is most likely a result of which of the following?",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "Heart failure manifests with dyspnea, easy fatigability, and in children, sweating while feeding and failure to thrive. A faint holosystolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border is consistent with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high in utero and decreases over the first few weeks of life. The progressive decrease in PVR and subsequent decrease in right ventricular pressure lead to increased left-to-right blood flow across the VSD. The enhanced shunting increases the overall volume of blood in pulmonary circulation, which causes increased lung perfusion (as evidenced by increased pulmonary vascular markings), increased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium, and left ventricular volume overload (resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy as evidenced on this patient's ECG and chest x-ray). These changes can lead to heart failure without cyanosis within the first few weeks to months of life, as seen in this child.\n\nIf the VSD is not repaired and pulmonary blood flow continues to be high, vascular remodeling in later stages will cause PVR to increase again, resulting first in right ventricular hypertrophy and persistent pulmonary hypertension and, eventually, shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome) resulting in heart failure with cyanosis.",

            "description": "A defect in the ventricular septum leads to a left-to-right shunt, the volume of which is dependent on the size of the defect. Blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (white arrow) along the pressure gradient (1). This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

        "explanation_why": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension in a patient with a VSD (which is initially a left-to-right shunt) could cause a shunt reversal (Eisenmenger reaction). However, Eisenmenger reaction is associated with cyanosis and right ventricular hypertrophy, and typically only occurs after a left-to-right shunt has persisted for an extended amount of time. The patient's age and the presence of only left ventricular hypertrophy indicate that the heart failure is triggered by a physiological adaptation that occurs during the first few weeks of life.",

However, a murmur due to LVOTO typically has a systolic ejection character and is usually heard at the upper sternal borders (with possible radiation to the carotid region) or the interscapular region.

The size of the defect is inversely proportional to the intensity of the murmur (i.e., small defects are associated with louder murmurs, while large defects may not have an associated murmur). A mid-diastolic murmur can also sometimes be heard with moderate or large VSDs due to increased flow across the mitral valve secondary to the left-to-right shunt.\n\nAfter a few years, a VSD can lead to pulmonary hypertension and a shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome) resulting in heart failure with cyanosis.

            "description": "Tetralogy of Fallot is the simultaneous occurrence of:\n(a) Pulmonary stenosis\n(b) Right ventricular hypertrophy\n(c) Ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n(d) An overriding aorta (above the VSD)The hemodynamic effects depend on the extent of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. With mild obstruction (1), a left-to-right shunt is more pronounced and there is mild cyanosis. With severe obstruction (2), a right-to-left shunt is more pronounced, which results in severe cyanosis. Pulmonary circulation may be supplied via a patent ductus arteriosus.",

        "explanation_why": "A right-to-left shunt through the ventricular septum can occur in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) who have severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO). In such a scenario, the path of least resistance is through the ventricular septal defect (VSD), and not through the pulmonary valve. Patients with RVOTO would have a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border and it would be unlikely for a patient with TOF to present without a history of cyanotic spells.\n\nA right-to-left shunt through the ventricular septum can also be seen in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to an isolated VSD. However, Eisenmenger syndrome develops only after an extended amount of time (usually a few years) and manifests with cyanosis and features of heart failure.",

However, patients with congenital LVOTO usually present soon after birth with features of heart failure. In addition, a murmur due to LVOTO typically has a systolic ejection character and is best heard at the upper sternal borders (with possible radiation to the carotid region) or the interscapular region.",

The patients who are most likely to develop complications and therefore require early surgical closure have medium or large VSDs; these VSDs manifest with softer murmurs and are typically not associated with a cardiac thrill.",

However, Doppler echocardiography has largely replaced catheterization in the initial workup of VSD, as it provides almost all of the same information without the associated risks of an invasive procedure.\n\nIn a patient with a VSD, cardiac catheterization would be indicated prior to surgical repair if pulmonary hypertension were suspected based on clinical (e.g., loud P_2) or echocardiographic findings. Cardiac catheterization is done to measure the reactivity of pulmonary vasculature to vasodilators because irreversible pulmonary artery hypertension is a contraindication to closure of the VSD.",

    "hint": "A right-to-left interatrial shunt (made apparent by a saline bubble study on echocardiography) that opens during coughing is diagnostic of patent foramen ovale (PFO). During coughing, right-to-left shunting of blood can occur through this defect because of the transiently increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation (and consequently increased right atrial pressure).",

Typically, endovascular closure is performed in patients with recurrent ischemic events despite medical therapy and patients in whom long-term anticoagulation is contraindicated. Since this patient does not present with clinical manifestations of paradoxical embolism, percutaneous closure is not indicated.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's mild, asymptomatic PFO requires no further diagnostic procedure, follow-up, or treatment. A persistent foramen ovale occurs in approx. 25–30% of the general population and, since most patients are asymptomatic, is typically an incidental finding. A diagnostic workup (i.e., contrast echocardiography) and treatment (e.g., anticoagulation, closure of the defect) only become necessary if paradoxical embolism occurs. While this patient has a soft-mid systolic murmur that may be just an innocent heart murmur, she is well without signs of paradoxical embolism (e.g., stroke symptoms).\n\nA split S_2 during inspiration is physiological. If the S_2 splitting is fixed (persistently audible on auscultation during inspiration and expiration), there might be an underlying right ventricular overload (e.g., large atrial septal defects). PFOs are usually hemodynamically irrelevant and so do not cause fixed S_2 splitting.",

However, echocardiography revealed tricuspid atresia, in which pulmonary blood flow and thus pulmonary vascular markings are decreased because of the concomitant pulmonary outflow tract obstruction.\n\nIn approximately 25% of cases of tricuspid valve atresia, no pulmonary stenosis is present. In these patients, the presence of a large, nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD) or a concomitant TGA may result in increased pulmonary blood flow and increased pulmonary markings. However, in those cases, auscultation would reveal a wide split S_2.",

        "content": "Left-axis deviation on electrocardiogram",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In TVA, blood is unable to pass from the right atrium (RA) to the right ventricle (RV). Consequently, the RV is almost always hypoplastic. Venous blood, therefore, passes from the RA via an atrial septal defect (which, under these circumstances, is essential for survival) to the left atrium, where it mixes with oxygenated blood from the lungs. The mixed blood is pumped from the left ventricle (LV) into the systemic circulation (resulting in cyanosis) and pulmonary circulation (via a patent ductus arteriosus). LV hypertrophy occurs because the LV is single-handedly pumping blood through both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. A combination of RV hypoplasia and LV hypertrophy results in a severe left-axis deviation. Other findings that may be present on ECG include tall P waves (due to right atrial enlargement) and small R waves in the right precordial leads (e.g., V1, V2).\n\nThe majority of patients with TVA also have a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and concomitant pulmonary outflow obstruction. The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border arises from a VSD. In a patient with TVA, a single S_2 that does not split with respiration indicates severely limited blood flow across the pulmonary valve and/or severe pulmonary stenosis. The systolic murmur of a VSD is softer with increasing severity of pulmonary stenosis and/or increasing size of the defect, because both result in a decreased pressure gradient across the VSD. Prostaglandin-E1 is given to maintain PDA patency (thereby increasing pulmonary circulation and blood oxygenation), but definitive treatment is staged surgical repair.",

However, a wide split S_2 is typically present in Ebstein anomaly, not a single S_2. Moreover, Ebstein anomaly is classically associated with fetal lithium or benzodiazepine exposure, of which there is no history here (e.g., a maternal history of bipolar disorder).

The remaining ventricle is small and hypocontractile. Because tricuspid valve regurgitation is also usually present, there is retrograde flow in the right atrium, which is dilated by the volume overload, in addition to antegrade pulmonary blood flow. Blood flows through the patent foramen ovale or (commonly associated) atrial septal defect from the right atrium to the left atrium (right-to-left shunt) and then via the left ventricle into the circulation, resulting in pronounced cyanosis. The pulmonary circulation system may also be perfused through blood from the aorta (via the ductus arteriosus).",

In TOF (the most likely diagnosis in this case), there is a right ventricular outflow obstruction, leading to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature.

        "explanation_why": "A VSD is an acyanotic congenital heart defect that initially has a left-to-right shunt. However, as blood flows through the defect into the right ventricle, blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature increases as well and over time results in increased pulmonary resistance and, ultimately, Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). In this event, the defect becomes cyanotic and the peripheral oxygen saturation decreases. The body responds to chronic hypoxemia by increased erythropoietin production and a subsequent increase in red blood cells, i.e. polycythemia.",

Even though a long-standing, uncorrected VSD can also lead to decreased blood pressure, there are no reports of this increasing the risk of myocardial ischemia.",

    "hint": "Cyanosis shortly after birth that does not improve with supplemental oxygen and a chest x-ray with the classic egg-on-a-string appearance (i.e., an enlarged heart with narrowed mediastinum due to an overlapping aorta and pulmonary trunk) are suggestive of a diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The holosystolic murmur indicates a coexistent ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is critical for life, as it allows for the mixing of oxygenated blood and its entry into the systemic circulation, especially after ductus arteriosus closure.",

The remaining ventricle is small and hypocontractile.

Blood flows through the patent foramen ovale or (commonly associated) atrial septal defect from the right atrium to the left atrium (right-to-left shunt) and then via the left ventricle into the circulation, resulting in pronounced cyanosis. The pulmonary circulation system may also be perfused through blood from the aorta (via the ductus arteriosus).",

        "explanation_why": "Exploratory laparoscopy is both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure used for pathology in the abdomen and pelvis that cannot be readily diagnosed using imaging modalities. This patient's history and physical examination make imperforate hymen very likely. In unclear cases, further workup would include sonography or possibly MRI. Exploratory laparoscopy is not the next best step, nor will it likely be needed in this patient.",

He opened his eyes spontaneously and followed commands. There was no loss of consciousness. He also had a headache with dizziness and nausea. Upon arrival, he is no longer confused. He feels well. Vital signs are within normal limits. He is fully alert and oriented. His speech is organized and he is able to perform tasks demonstrating full attention, memory, and balance. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the crown of his head but no signs of skin break or fracture.

Observation in the emergency department (ED) for at least 4–6 hours should include serial neurological examination and assessment of GCS. Alterations in mental status or focal neurological signs may indicate more serious underlying pathology, such as intracranial bleeding. Following discharge, this patient should be monitored by a responsible individual for at least 24 hours after injury and return to the ED if there are any neurological changes. Patients should also progress through six stages of a gradual return to sports. As each stage requires at least 24 hours, this patient will need to refrain from contact sports for at least one week.\n\nNeuroimaging is not routinely recommended for mild TBI. If at any point during the observation period the GCS deteriorates to < 13, patients should be reclassified as having moderate TBI or severe TBI and managed accordingly.",

Multiple dilated bowel loops (B) may alternatively be seen in jejunal atresia, and the number of loops may increase in conjunction with a more distal location of the atresia.1: gastric air-fluid level; 2: duodenal air-fluid level; 3: jejunal air-fluid level",

This patient is still within the expected time frame for meconium passage and his gasless distal abdomen on x-ray suggests a bowel obstruction more proximal than the rectosigmoid colon, as dilated loops of the large bowel would be expected in Hirschsprung disease.",

Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and male gender are risk factors for the development of IHPS. However, the emesis is non-bilious and projectile and will not present until the pylorus has had time to hypertrophy several weeks after birth. A palpable, olive-shaped mass is also usually present, and abdominal x-ray will show distention of the stomach only. This infant's bilious emesis, age, and triple bubble sign suggest another diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Gastroschisis is a congenital ventral wall defect that is usually isolated. By contrast, omphalocele is commonly associated with structural abnormalities of extraintestinal organs (e.g., heart, neural tube) and often occurs in the context of syndrome complexes (e.g., chromosomal trisomies, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome). In gastroschisis, the absence of a hernia sac results in an edematous, erythematous, and dull intestinal wall. This condition is mainly seen in premature infants and those with intrauterine growth restriction, and can be associated with cryptorchidism, gastrointestinal stenoses, and atresia, the latter of which can result in short bowel syndrome. Because gastroschisis is not covered by a hernia sac, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) can diffuse freely into the amniotic fluid and maternal circulation, leading to elevated MSAFP, which can be detected by a screening test.",

            "description": "Omphalocele: herniation of intraabdominal contents through an anterior abdominal wall defect at the base of the umbilical cord caused by the failure of the midgut to return to the abdominal cavity after its physiological herniation through the umbilical ring. Accordingly, the hernial sac is formed by the amniotic membrane and peritoneum, and the umbilical cord lies at the apex of the hernia.Gastroschisis: a developmental defect of the anterior abdominal wall in the paraumbilical region through which intraabdominal contents prolapse. As it is the anterior abdominal wall that fails to develop correctly, there is no outer peritoneal or membranous covering.Congenital umbilical hernia: herniation of intraabdominal contents through a patent umbilical orifice, which typically closes by 2 years of age. The sac of a paraumbilical hernia is the peritoneum.Diastasis recti: an abnormally wide separation of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles. The abdominal fascia are intact. There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up).",

The tumor can develop in any bone, but most commonly affects the metaphyses and diaphyses of long bones (e.g., femur, tibia, humerus) or the spine. The characteristic clinical feature is a persistent, intense, aching pain localized to the site of the lesion that worsens at night. Physical examination often shows pain on palpation that is not exacerbated by movement, unless intracapsular lesions occur. Since this patient has no history of pain at rest or at night, and extension/flexion elicits pain, osteoid osteoma is unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "Traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle occurs in Osgood Schlatter disease, which typically affects adolescent athletes. Overuse (e.g., sports that involve running and jumping) leads to the patellar tendon exerting excessive strain on the tibial tuberosity, which is not yet fully ossified in adolescents and is thus susceptible to detachment. Patients typically present with anterior knee pain localized to the tibial tubercle. Visible swelling of the proximal tibia may also be present. X-ray is usually not required for diagnosis, but may be helpful to rule out differential diagnoses, especially in cases of atypical presentation (e.g., history of trauma, nocturnal pain, pain at rest). This patient's age, history, and x-ray findings of fragmentation and irregularity of the tibial tubercle are all indicative of Osgood Schlatter disease.\n\nOsgood Schlatter disease is usually self-limited. Treatment is therefore primarily conservative, consisting of rest, ice, stretching exercises, and NSAIDs.",

The condition manifests with diffuse joint pain during activities and progressive joint stiffness with locking or catching of the joint. On physical examination, range of motion is intact, though palpation of the femoral condyles in the flexed knee elicits pain. OCD can be ruled out since this patient presents with pain over the proximal tibial and not the femoral condyles. Moreover, patients with OCD would have a crescent-shaped radiolucency on the medial femoral condyle, whereas this patient's abnormality is on the tibial tuberosity.",

Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity.

Regardless, it would not help the necrotic bone of Osgood Schlatter disease heal. Additionally, an injection intended to treat tendinopathies should be paratendinous, rather than intratendinous, to minimize damage to an already inflamed tendon.",

        "explanation_why": "Open reduction is used to treat avulsion fractures of the tibial tuberosity, which is both a differential diagnosis of Osgood Schlatter disease and a possible complication of it. In patients with avulsion fractures, the quadriceps tendon, which inserts in the area of the tibial tuberosity, is typically retracted. This retraction elevates the patella, which is embedded in the quadriceps tendon, and leads to decreased quadriceps strength. This patient does not have reduced quadriceps strength, and the x-ray only shows fragmentation, not avulsion fracture, of the tuberosity.",

The aggressive tumor is accompanied by periosteal elevation that has created a triangular area of new bone (Codman triangle; yellow overlay). Linear bony spicules radiate outward and resemble rays of the sun (sunburst pattern; examples indicated by blue lines).A Codman triangle is seen in the setting of an aggressive bone lesion when only the edge of the raised periosteum ossifies. Sunburst periosteal reaction, another sign of aggressive periostitis, occurs when the periosteum is unable to form organized layers and Sharpey fibers are stretched.",

    "hint": "This neonate's physical examination findings (tenderness, swelling, and crepitus over the left clavicle, decreased mobility of the left upper extremity, asymmetric Moro reflex) are consistent with a neonatal clavicle fracture.

This patient's reduced movement of the left upper extremity is most likely a manifestation of pseudoparalysis, not true brachial plexus injury, especially since his hand movement is normal. Decreased ipsilateral extremity movement is believed to take strain off the clavicle and reduce discomfort for the child. If this infant does not recover function by one month of age, a nerve conduction study should be considered to evaluate for underlying nerve damage.",

To reduce discomfort, the patient's sleeve can be pinned to the front of their shirt with the arm flexed at 90 degrees. Analgesics may also be considered. After 2 weeks, proper healing should be confirmed either via clinical examination (palpable callus formation) or x-ray. The condition usually self-resolves within 2–3 weeks, and long-term complications are not expected.\n\nNeonatal clavicle fracture is most often a clinical diagnosis but an x-ray can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",

The inability to pass a catheter through the nasal cavities supports the presumptive diagnosis of choanal atresia. Confirmatory testing by CT scan or contrast rhinography in the supine position should follow. Unilateral choanal atresia is twice as prevalent as its bilateral counterpart.

However, the success rates of gonadotropin therapy are highly variable and there is a possibility of long-term adverse effects (e.g., low testicular volume, infertility) in infants who received gonadotropin therapy. Hormonal therapy with gonadotropins is not recommended for the treatment of cryptorchidism.",

Early surgery promotes normal testicular growth and improves the chances of fertility. Because the infant has a palpable testis in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is the surgical procedure of choice. Orchiopexy should ideally be performed between 6–12 months, but no later than 24 months of corrected age.\n\nThe rate of cryptorchidism is higher in preterm infants, such as this patient, and in patients who are small for gestational age or have low birth weight. Complications of cryptorchidism include subfertility and testicular cancer (even in patients who underwent timely intervention), inguinal hernia (due to concurrent patent processus vaginalis), and testicular torsion.",

    "hint": "This infant presents with an asymptomatic right-sided scrotal swelling that is fluctuant, transilluminates and does not extend into the inguinal region.

        "explanation_why": "The scrotal swelling in this infant is typical of a congenital communicating hydrocele, which occurs due to a failed closure of the processus vaginalis during development. This condition resolves spontaneously in most cases by 1 year of age, as the patent processus vaginalis normally closes during the first year of life. Moreover, since this infant's hydrocele is small, it is unlikely to cause pressure-related complications, such as atrophy of the testis or skin erosions. Reassurance and follow-up is, therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.\n\nThe preliminary diagnosis of a hydrocele can be confirmed by ultrasonography, which typically reveals anechoic fluid. Ligation of the patent processus vaginalis is the procedure of choice for pediatric communicating hydroceles which do not resolve spontaneously by 1 year of age.",

However, drainage is not recommended for congenital hydroceles, since here the hydrocele communicates with the peritoneal cavity and contains peritoneal fluid. In these cases, aspiration brings no benefit, as the processus vaginalis will again fill with peritoneal fluid after the drainage, and hence the hydrocele will recur.",

Typically, an unaffected side is also prophylactically operated on. Testicular torsion is known to occur in neonates, and it could be either in-utero or postnatal. Prenatal torsion presents with few localized findings, but postnatal torsion could present with considerable scrotal swelling. However, the swelling would be extremely tender.

        "explanation_why": "Immunoglobulins required for the opsonization of encapsulated organisms are predominantly produced in the white pulp of the spleen. Asplenic patients are therefore at increased risk of developing overwhelming postsplenectomy infections (OPSI) by encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B because these pathogens are no longer opsonized by IgG antibodies and phagocytosed by splenic macrophages. In addition to vaccination against these pathogens, which should occur either > 2 weeks before scheduled splenectomy or > 2 weeks after splenectomy, pediatric patients should also receive continuous antibiotic prophylaxis with oral penicillin or amoxicillin at least until the age of five years. A longer duration of antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered, especially in immunosuppressed individuals (e.g., with HIV infection, congenital immunodeficiencies, chronic liver disease).\n\nThe risk of sepsis remains increased for up to 30 years after splenectomy but is highest in asplenic children. Adults are not routinely prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis after splenectomy. OPSI, however, has a high mortality rate if left untreated, and patients should receive empirical therapy with vancomycin and an intravenous third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) immediately upon suspicion of OPSI.",

He started to become sexually active with his girlfriend 3 weeks ago; they use condoms regularly. There is no personal or family history of serious illness and he takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the external genitalia shows no groin protrusion and no penile discharge or lesions. Inguinal lymph nodes are normal. There is a palpable soft, irregular swelling above the left testis. This swelling is more prominent while standing and disappears in the supine position. Right scrotal examination shows no abnormalities. The patient is at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?",

The most probable mechanism is impaired spermatogenesis as a result of increased testicular temperature and testicular ischemia (due to increased intratesticular pressure, venous stasis, and/or vasoconstriction secondary to catecholamine reflux from the adrenal gland). The diagnosis of a varicocele is confirmed by ultrasonography, which should reveal dilated pampiniform veins.\n\nIn young men, semen analysis should be performed regularly to assess sperm number and quality. Most asymptomatic patients do not require intervention. Definitive treatment with laparoscopic varicocelectomy or percutaneous embolization is indicated for those with intractable discomfort and/or abnormalities on semen analysis.",

        "explanation_why": "Voiding cystourethrogram is the test of choice to diagnose posterior urethral valves (PUV), which is the most common cause of urinary tract obstruction (UTO) in newborn males. Lower UTO, indicated by the presence of bilateral hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound, results in reduced urine output and oligohydramnios. The decreased amount of amniotic fluid leads to the development of Potter sequence. Moreover, oligohydramnios can affect the development of the fetal lung resulting in lung hypoplasia, which is the most likely cause of this patient's cyanosis and hypoxia.\n\nOnce the vital functions have been stabilized, temporary insertion of a urinary catheter can relieve the UTO and allow for correction of possible electrolyte imbalances. Definitive treatment of PUV is either primary valve ablation during cystoscopy (first-line) or vesicostomy (in preterm boys or if ablation is not possible).",

Some of these defects are associated with certain genetic/chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot or persistent truncus arteriosus with DiGeorge syndrome), which often present with craniofacial anomalies. However, the patient's hydronephrosis and limb abnormalities cannot be explained by this diagnosis.",

Low-set ears and retrognathia can be seen in patients with Edwards syndrome. A flattened nose and epicanthus are features of Down syndrome. The combination of oligohydramnios, hydronephrosis, and respiratory distress in the newborn period would not be typical for a chromosomal aberration.

While the symptoms of neonatal sepsis may be nonspecific, infants with neonatal pneumonia typically present with dyspnea and decreased breath sounds, as seen in the vignette.

Chest x-ray is used, however, for diagnosing infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and meconium aspiration. IRDS manifests most frequently in preterm infants, usually immediately after birth, with signs of increased breathing effort, hypoxia, cyanosis, and decreased breath sounds on auscultation. However, the additional clinical features seen in this neonate (e.g., craniofacial dysmorphism, limb abnormalities, and hydronephrosis) could not be explained by this diagnosis. Meconium aspiration syndrome manifests with respiratory distress or unresponsiveness usually in postterm rather than preterm infants. Furthermore, the absence of a green amniotic fluid makes the diagnosis unlikely in this patient.",

        "explanation_why": "Leydig cell tumors are rare testicular tumors that usually develop after the age of 4. The tumors typically manifest as painless testicular masses and produce large amounts of testosterone as well as smaller amounts of estrogen, progesterone, and corticosteroids. The excess in androgens leads to precocious pseudopuberty in boys with prominent external genitalia, accelerated skeletomuscular development, mature masculine voice, and growth of facial, axillary, and pubic hair. GnRH, FSH, and LH levels are decreased in response to the elevated androgen levels in precocious pseudopuberty. The treatment of Leydig-cell tumors consists of surgical resection using radical inguinal orchiectomy.\n\nSee “Overview of testicular tumors” table.",

A twisted and thus corkscrew-like appearance of the duodenum and duodenal blockage with a distended stomach would reflect midgut volvulus. See “Imaging in intestinal malrotation and midgut volvulus” table.\n\nGiven this neonate's hemodynamic stability, there is no indication for emergency surgery, but the Ladd procedure is recommended as soon as possible to minimize the risk of future volvulus.",

It is most helpful in establishing the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, which also manifests with acute-onset emesis and abdominal pain. Classically, an olive-shaped mass can be felt on abdominal exam; this patient's abdominal exam is notable for mild distention but no mass is evident. Moreover, the patient described here has bilious vomiting, a finding that is less likely with an obstruction caused by a hypertrophic pylorus, which is proximal to the ampulla of Vater and is therefore more commonly associated with nonbilious vomiting. While ultrasonography can be used in the diagnosis of intestinal malrotation and midgut volvulus, it is not the most sensitive diagnostic technique.

        "explanation_why": "Acute treatment of caustic ingestion includes airway management, supplemental oxygen, fluid resuscitation, and decontamination (e.g., removal of contaminated clothes). Upper endoscopy within 12–24 hours should be performed in symptomatic patients to assess the severity of esophageal injury and guide further therapy, such as the need for surgery. Endoscopy is contraindicated in cases of airway compromise (e.g., burns in the area of the epiglottis) and overt esophageal perforation seen on initial radiography imaging (e.g., x-ray or CT scan). If the airway is compromised, intubation needs to be performed first (as was done in this patient). In overt perforation, immediate surgery is required.\n\nLong-term sequelae of caustic ingestion include esophageal strictures and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.",

Furthermore, gastric lavage can induce vomiting or push some of the stomach contents back into the esophagus. In both cases, the esophagus would again be exposed to the caustic agent, potentially causing further damage. Therefore, gastric lavage is contraindicated for the treatment of caustic ingestion.",

If there is a perforation, barium would leak into the mediastinum and potentially cause mediastinitis. If perforation is suspected, a water-soluble contrast agent should be used instead. Barium swallow may be useful for evaluating strictures or stenoses 2–3 weeks after the ingestion.",

On close inspection, a double rim (dashed lines), or halo (green overlay), is visible on the PA view, which indicates that it is a button battery. A step-off (arrows) to the small diameter anode (hatched green overlay) is seen on the lateral view.Recognition of a button battery in the esophagus is a pediatric emergency. Radiographs can frequently differentiate button batteries from similarly sized coins and ascertain the direction of the anode, where the most severe damage from the battery occurs. The anode step-off (arrows) may not be visible on some very thin batteries.",

Five days ago, her mother noticed traces of blood on her daughter's underwear while doing the laundry. The patient has had intermittent lower abdominal discomfort for the past 4 months but feels well otherwise. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is at the 95^th percentile for height and at the 70^th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient appears well nourished. Physical examination shows breast buds that are elevated and extend beyond the areolae. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. There is no axillary or pubic hair. The external genital organs appear normal. There is no vaginal discharge. An x-ray of the left wrist shows a bone age of 9 years. Serum luteinizing hormone concentration does not increase following gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist stimulation. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's clinical findings?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "The development of secondary sexual characteristics and menarche in a girl < 8 years of age in combination with advanced bone age indicates precocious puberty. This patient's luteinizing hormone (LH) levels do not respond to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist stimulation, which is characteristic of peripheral precocious puberty (PPP).",

        "content": "Juvenile granulosa cell tumor",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This patient's intermittent lower abdominal discomfort in combination with signs of hyperestrogenism (e.g., premature menarche, precocious breast development) indicates an estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor (e.g., granulosa cell tumor, thecoma) as the underlying cause of PPP. Although granulosa cell tumors are more common in perimenopausal patients, there is a rare juvenile type that typically manifests with PPP and a bone age greater than chronological age. Because of the high levels of estrogen produced by these tumors, LH production is suppressed and there is no LH response to GnRH agonist stimulation. Pediatric patients with estrogen-secreting tumors are usually taller than their peers, but if the condition is untreated, they often have a short stature in adulthood due to early closure of the epiphyseal plate.\n\nPatients with granulosa cell tumors may have a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and pelvic imaging usually shows enlarged ovaries. Inhibin A and/or Inhibin B can be used as tumor markers. Regression of symptoms is expected after tumor resection (e.g., unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy).",

Patients with mild 21β-hydroxylase deficiency (nonclassic CAH) can present with normal isosexual external genitalia, PPP, and advanced bone age. However, pubarche and/or treatment-resistant acne due to androgen excess would also be expected. This patient has isolated findings of excess estrogen (precocious development of breast buds, menarche). In addition, CAH would not explain her intermittent lower abdominal discomfort.\n\nClassic CAH manifests earlier in life with features of pseudohermaphroditism (e.g., clitoromegaly at birth) and signs of virilization (e.g., hirsutism), which are also not present here.",

        "explanation_why": "A CT scan is the preferred method to confirm the diagnosis of JNA and to assess the extent of the tumor. These rare, benign, but rapidly expanding tumors occur exclusively in boys and manifest with a mass arising from the roof of the nasopharynx on a cranial CT scan. JNAs typically show strong contrast enhancement on CT scan due to their increased vascularity, which is the cause for recurrent epistaxis. The tumors also induce pressure necrosis on adjacent structures (e.g., the orbits, the intracranial cavity). Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for symptomatic JNAs, because they are locally aggressive and have a high recurrence rate. Radiosurgery (i.e., with a stereotactic gamma knife) is reserved for recurrent JNAs and/or JNAs with intracranial extension.",

        "explanation_why": "Biliary cysts (i.e., choledochal cysts) are most commonly seen in patients of Asian descent and appear as saccular or fusiform dilations of the biliary tree or as dilated masses that communicate with the biliary tree. A biliary cyst can result in cholestatic jaundice, abdominal pain, and a palpable right upper quadrant mass and, if left untreated, increases the risk of cholangitis and malignancy (e.g., cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, gallbladder cancer). In rare cases, a biliary cyst may involve the cystic duct and result in gallbladder dilation. The recommended treatment for a biliary cyst is surgical excision of the cyst, followed by the creation of a biliary-enteric anastomosis with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.",

Growth hormone (GH) stimulates IGF-1 synthesis, which in turn promotes cell proliferation, especially of the bones and cartilage. Excess GH also has a diabetogenic effect, which explains the elevated serum glucose seen in this patient. The treatment of choice for both gigantism and acromegaly is transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Pharmacotherapy with somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide) is indicated if GH excess is not completely resolved by surgery or if surgery is not possible.\n\nSee \"Etiology of tall stature\" table.",

He has a history of sickle cell disease and had an episode of dactylitis of his left index finger 3 years ago. Current medications include hydroxyurea and acetaminophen as needed for ankle pain. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 14/min and blood pressure is 125/68 mm Hg. Examination shows a tender, swollen, and erythematous right ankle with point tenderness over the medial malleolus. X-ray of the right ankle demonstrates marked periosteal thickening and elevation, as well as a central sclerotic lesion with a lucent rim over the right medial malleolus. A bone biopsy culture confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",

An additional finding is inferior rib notching (Roesler sign; examples indicated by arrowheads), which is produced by dilated intercostal arteries.The figure-3 sign of coarctation (indicated by red line) is seen in this patient. It is produced by prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery in combination with post-stenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The presence of bilateral rib notching indicates that the coarctation is distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries.",

Nonseminoma tumors include embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumors, testicular choriocarcinomas, teratomas, and tumors with mixed germ cell histology. Pure teratomas typically do not cause an elevation in testicular tumor markers (beta-hCG, AFP, PLAP), which is consistent with this patient's laboratory studies. Teratomas are more common in children but are usually benign in this patient group. In adult males, they are rare but more often malignant.\n\nUnlike hydroceles, testicular tumors do not transilluminate on examination. Typically, testicular tumors should not be percutaneously biopsied because a biopsy can cause seeding of malignant cells in the scrotum.",

        "explanation_why": "Digital clubbing is a sign of chronic hypoxemia, which is a complication of an untreated VSD. VSDs are acyanotic congenital heart defects that manifest as a left-to-right shunt. An untreated VSD can lead to chronic volume overload of the right ventricle (RV) and subsequently increased blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature. This increased flow causes irreversible remodeling of the small pulmonary vessels, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and RV hypertrophy. RV pressure increases until it exceeds left ventricular (LV) pressure, at which point the shunt is reversed. This shunt reversal is known as Eisenmenger syndrome. Cyanosis and consequently, chronic tissue hypoxia, leads to the development of digital clubbing.\n\nChronic tissue hypoxia and megakaryocyte fragmentation are primary factors involved in the pathogenesis of digital clubbing. In Eisenmenger syndrome, blood can completely bypass the pulmonary vasculature, allowing whole megakaryocytes into the systemic circulation. Once these intact cells reach distal capillaries in the hands and feet, they impact and subsequently fragment. This fragmentation causes the release of platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, inducing angiogenesis and local mesenchymal growth and proliferation, which clinically manifests as digital clubbing.",

The cyst can develop anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct and manifests as a painless, firm, midline mass of the anterior neck. Like the thyroid gland, the thyroglossal cyst is enclosed within the pretracheal fascia, which is responsible for the upward movement of these structures during swallowing. In addition, a thyroglossal cyst moves upward with tongue protrusion because the fibrous remnants of the thyroglossal duct are connected to the base of the tongue.",

    "hint": "Echocardiography showing a pulmonary artery arising from the left ventricle and aorta arising from the right ventricle confirms the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) which is an important cause of neonatal cyanosis that will not improve with supplemental oxygen. The continuous machine-like murmur indicates a coexistent patent ductus arteriosus, which is critical for life, as it allows mixing of oxygenated blood and its entry into the systemic circulation. Patients may also have coexistent arterial or ventricular septal defects that allow mixing of blood between the two circuits.",

Neonates with HLHS also have weak peripheral pulses, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis as the hypoplastic left ventricle cannot maintain adequate cardiac output.

Exertion, such as crying or feeding, increases the RVOO. This results in cyanosis (tet spells) due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD instead of the pulmonary valve, which in turn causes the murmur to become softer. The right ventricle hypertrophies because it chronically pumps against high resistance caused by the RVOO.\n\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during a tet spell. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases left ventricular pressure and decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the VSD. Infants who are having a tet spell should be placed with their knees toward their chest to achieve the same effect.",

It usually takes many years for HCC to develop and this cancer would, therefore, be a late rather than an early complication of biliary atresia. Patients with a chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, on the other hand, have a significantly increased risk of developing HCC.

CBE develops as a result of excess indirect bilirubin, either due to increased production of unconjugated bilirubin (e.g., hemolysis, red cell membrane defects, erythrocyte enzyme defects) or decreased clearance (e.g., Crigler-Najjar syndromes, Gilbert syndrome). However, this patient has elevated direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia. Conjugated bilirubin is hydrophilic and cannot pass the blood-brain barrier; it is therefore not deposited in the brain.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Early liver cirrhosis is a serious concern in patients with biliary atresia. Atretic bile ducts prevent biliary outflow, causing retained bile, which is hepatotoxic. Bile retention leads to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, which can ultimately progress to cirrhosis as early as 9 weeks after birth. Symptoms of biliary atresia often become apparent around two weeks after birth, as bile production increases, overwhelms the narrowed ducts, and becomes retained in the liver. Treatment consists of hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE), where a connection is made between the hepatic hilus and small intestine to allow for bile drainage. This procedure should be performed as early as possible after diagnosis. However, biliary atresia remains the primary cause for pediatric liver transplantation, as HPE is only a temporizing measure.",

In addition, jaundice, acholic stool, dark urine, and hepatomegaly are associated with cholestatic conditions, rather than acute inflammation of the gall bladder wall.

Maternal use of vasoconstrictive drugs (e.g., cocaine, MDMA, or cigarettes) increases the risk for this malformation.\n\nIntestinal atresia of any origin is suggested by a prenatal history of polyhydramnios, since the fetus cannot drink the amniotic fluid due to the intestinal obstruction.",

Growth hormone (GH) stimulates insulin-like growth factor 1 synthesis in the liver, which in turn promotes cell proliferation, especially of the bones and cartilage. Excess GH also has a diabetogenic effect, which explains the elevated serum glucose in this patient. The treatment of choice for gigantism is transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection.\n\nGrowth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas can cause gigantism in children and adolescents and acromegaly in adults. Both conditions are managed surgically with transsphenoidal adenomectomy, or, if surgery is not possible, pharmacologically with somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide).",

Tumors in the posterior cranial fossa can present with dizziness, nausea, and clumsiness due to obstructive hydrocephalus and/or cerebellar damage. On imaging, a pilocytic astrocytoma typically appears as a well-demarcated cystic mass with a brightly enhancing nodule in the wall of the cyst.\n\nOptic gliomas, a type of pilocytic astrocytoma in the optic pathway, are strongly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. A subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, another low-grade astrocytoma that occurs within ventricles, is associated with tuberous sclerosis.",

He is conscious. His pulse is 135/min, and blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. His hemoglobin concentration is 5.9 g/dL. His son sustained multiple body contusions and loss of consciousness. He remains unresponsive in the emergency department. A focused assessment of the boy with sonography is concerning for multiple organ lacerations and internal bleeding. The physician decides to move the man's son to the operating room for emergency surgical exploration. The father says that he and his son are Jehovah's witnesses and do not want blood transfusions. The physician calls the boy's biological mother who confirms this religious belief. She also asks the physician to wait for her arrival before any other medical decisions are undertaken.

As a confirmatory test, fetal ultrasound will show free-floating bowel without a membranous sac. Risk factors include young maternal age (i.e., under 20 years of age), and tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy.

As it is the anterior abdominal wall that fails to develop correctly, there is no outer peritoneal or membranous covering.Congenital umbilical hernia: herniation of intraabdominal contents through a patent umbilical orifice, which typically closes by 2 years of age. The sac of a paraumbilical hernia is the peritoneum.Diastasis recti: an abnormally wide separation of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles. The abdominal fascia are intact. There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up).",

        "explanation_why": "Omphalocele is a congenital ventral wall defect in which protrusion of the abdominal contents covered with peritoneum occurs at the site of umbilical cord insertion. Although maternal serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) is also elevated in this condition (due to leakage of AFP into the amniotic fluid and maternal circulation), fetal ultrasound shows midline herniation of abdominal contents within a hernia sac in contrast to the free-floating viscera seen on this patient's prenatal ultrasound. In addition, omphalocele is commonly associated with other congenital diseases, including trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, evidence of which is not described in the fetus.",

The procedure is uncomplicated. Three hours after the procedure, the mother reports that the newborn is not feeding well and cries and coughs often. His temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F), pulse is 170/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 100%. The neonate intermittently clenches his hands and toes, opens his mouth, and tightly closes his eyes. Muscle tone in the extremities is increased. The diaper is wet with clear urine and traces of blood.

    "content_preview": "A 2500-g (5-lb 8-oz) healthy male newborn delivered at 38 weeks' gestation after an uncomplicated pregnancy undergoes circumcision 48 hours after birth. The procedure is uncomplicated. Three hours after the procedure, the mother reports that the newborn is not feeding well and cries and coughs often. His temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F), pulse is 170/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 100%. The neonate intermittently clenches his hands and toes, opens his mouth, and tightly closes his eyes. Muscle tone in the extremities is increased. The diaper is wet with clear urine and traces of blood. Examination of the genitalia shows a crust of blood along the cut prepuce, erythema of the glans penis, and edema around the corona of the glans penis. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart sounds are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "In a neonate with signs and symptoms that suggest pain following an invasive procedure, analgesia with a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures is indicated. The initial choice of analgesic intervention depends on the anticipated intensity of pain. First-line pharmacological therapy in a neonate with pain following circumcision is topical anesthetics (e.g., topical lidocaine). If the neonate still shows signs and symptoms of pain despite topical therapy, other therapies should be considered following a stepwise approach (i.e., systemic acetaminophen or NSAIDs → intravenous opioids → subcutaneous lidocaine/specific nerve blocks → sedation). In addition, nonpharmacological measures, such as breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, and oral sucrose, are always indicated for pain management.\n\nAlthough it was previously thought that neonates do not feel painful stimuli to the same degree as adults, accumulating evidence suggests otherwise. The sensory system is fully functional by the middle of the second trimester and both preterm and full-term neonates experience painful stimuli. Following invasive procedures such as circumcision, neonates should be assessed for pain and treated accordingly.",

This patient, however, has no abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary examination and no signs of increased breathing effort (e.g., nasal flaring, intercostal retractions), cyanosis, or hypoxia (normal oxygen saturation). Crying babies often cough to clear the secretions that accumulate while crying; therefore, cough is not considered a sign of disease here. Tachypnea and tachycardia are common responses to pain; they are even included in certain scales and scores for neonatal pain assessment (e.g., NIPS, CRIES).",

In a child with a history of recent blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., handlebar injury during a fall from a bicycle), duodenal hematoma is the most likely diagnosis. Duodenal hematoma is a common injury in children following blunt abdominal trauma because the abdominal wall is thinner and less developed, making hollow viscus more prone to injury. The hematoma typically resolves spontaneously in days to weeks. Hemodynamically stable patients can be managed conservatively with nasogastric intubation and total parenteral nutrition. Laparotomy may be indicated in hemodynamically unstable children and/or in those with suspected duodenal perforation.",

He was delivered at 35 weeks' gestation because of premature rupture of membranes. Apgar scores were 8 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. His parents refused prenatal screening. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 146/min, respirations are 51/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa. Crackles are heard throughout both lung bases. There is a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border. Insertion of a nasogastric tube is attempted but the tube cannot be passed beyond 6 cm from the gums. An x-ray with contrast shows a blind-ended esophageal pouch; there is abundant gas in the stomach. Screening for which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Coughing and choking spells when feeding, in conjunction with cyanosis, crackles on lung auscultation, and the inability to pass a feeding tube, suggest esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). This diagnosis is confirmed by the x-ray findings. The harsh systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation suggests a cardiac structural anomaly.",

About 50% of esophageal atresia cases are associated with other mesodermal defects, known as the VACTERL association: Vertebral anomaly, Anal atresia, Cardiac anomaly, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Renal anomaly (including agenesis), and Limb malformation. Newborns with esophageal atresia should, therefore, undergo screening for other VACTERL anomalies. Screening typically includes echocardiography and renal ultrasonography.\n\nEsophageal atresia with TEF to the distal esophageal segment is the most common type of esophageal atresia, accounting for > 75% of cases. A fetus with esophageal atresia is unable to swallow amniotic fluid, resulting in polyhydramnios, which can lead to premature rupture of membranes and premature labor, as seen here.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Features of heart failure (e.g., irritability, poor feeding, failure to thrive) with a continuous murmur in the left infraclavicular region are highly suggestive of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), for which premature birth is a risk factor.

Prostaglandins keep the ductus arteriosus patent, and by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin production and thus promote ductal closure. NSAIDs are only effective in preterm infants.\n\nTranscatheter or surgical closure is the treatment of choice for infants ≥ 6 kg, children, and adults. In preterm infants, procedural closure is generally only used if pharmacological treatment is unsuccessful.",

        "explanation_why": "Bilateral choanal atresia, a congenital condition characterized by complete blockage of the nasal cavity, typically manifests immediately after birth with respiratory distress, grunting breath sounds, and central cyanosis which improves with crying and worsens with feeding and at rest. The best initial test is the passage of a catheter through the nares, which is not possible in bilateral choanal atresia. Contrast rhinography in the supine position or CT scan of the facial bones confirms the diagnosis. After establishing an oropharyngeal airway, transnasal endoscopic resection of the posterior nasal septum is the most appropriate treatment to provide a permanent nasal airway. These procedures help prevent life-threatening cyanotic attacks and aspiration when the newborn's mouth is blocked during feeding. Finally, the newborn should be examined for other congenital anomalies since choanal atresia is often associated with CHARGE syndrome.\n\nSplitting of the second heart sound, as seen in this newborn, occurs physiologically during inspiration, which leads to delayed closure of the pulmonary valve (P_2) due to increased right ventricular ejection time.",

This condition may manifest immediately after birth with respiratory distress and cyanotic attacks, similar to what is seen in this patient. Since newborns with EA are unable to swallow properly, excessive foamy secretions at the mouth would also be expected.

However, infants with TOF and episodic cyanosis (i.e., tet spells) typically have mild RVOTO and only become symptomatic at 2–4 months of age. In contrast, newborns with TOF and cyanosis immediately after birth usually have severe RVOTO with symptoms that do not fluctuate or improve with crying.

One hour earlier, they found him on the floor playing with small magnets from his father's desk and several are now missing. The patient appears well now. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/58 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft and nontender abdomen; bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the abdomen shows two round, high-density areas at the level of the stomach. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Since this patient ingested multiple magnets that are lodged in the stomach, another step in management is more appropriate at this time.",

However, this approach is preferred if a single magnet is ingested or if the magnet has progressed further away from the stomach.

        "explanation_why": "Activated charcoal can be used to treat different types of poisoning, including acetaminophen, aspirin, and tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. In order to achieve optimal effectiveness, activated charcoal should be administered within 1–2 hours of ingestion so that it can bind to the poisonous substance and prevent its intestinal resorption. Intestinal absorption of magnets, however, does not occur. Magnet ingestion can cause pressure necrosis of the bowel, perforation, or fistula formation; therefore, another step in management is more appropriate at this time.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Flexible endoscopy is the most appropriate initial step in management for multiple magnets lodged in the esophagus or stomach (after confirmation with an abdominal x-ray). Immediate removal of the ingested magnets is important because they can lead to serious complications (e.g., perforation, volvulus, infection, ileus), especially if the magnet is ingested with a metallic foreign body or if multiple magnets are ingested at different times. Therefore, flexible endoscopy is preferred because it allows any damage to the gastrointestinal wall to be visualized and assessed. If the magnets are further away from the stomach and the patient is asymptomatic, or if a single magnet is ingested, conservative management with serial abdominal x-rays to confirm passage through the intestines can be considered. Alternatively, enteroscopy or colonoscopy can be performed if the magnets can be reached. Surgery may be necessary if the magnets do not progress through the intestines and the patient is symptomatic.",

The periosteum in growing bones is thicker and stronger than in adults, which is why children are more prone to incomplete fractures (e.g., torus fractures, greenstick fractures). X-rays typically show mild or no angulation at the fracture site, disruption and bulging of the cortex on the side of the compressive force (concave side), and an intact convex side. Treatment consists of immobilization with a splint or a cast for 3–4 weeks.\n\nSee “Characteristics of incomplete fractures” table.",

            "description": "In a complete fracture, there is a discontinuity between the bone fragments, whereas in incomplete fractures, the fracture line is either absent or does not completely traverse the entire bone. Incomplete fractures are more common in children due to their thicker, stronger periosteum and the greater elasticity of growing bones. Types of incomplete fractures include:Buckle (torus) fracture: A compressive force results in bulging, i.e., buckling of the cortex. More specifically, a buckle fracture is characterized by bulging of only one side of the cortex (the concave side), while a fracture in which the bulge is circumferential is referred to more precisely as a “torus fracture.” However, the terms are frequently used interchangeably.Greenstick fracture: There is discontinuity of the cortex and periosteum on the convex (tension) side of the fracture, but bending occurs only on the concave (compression) side.Bowing fracture: There is angulation but no discontinuity of the cortex or periosteum.",

Scoliosis due to intraspinal diseases (e.g., tumors, syringomyelia) can manifest with bilateral leg pain, muscle aches, and spasms. However, intraspinal diseases typically manifest with more significant neurological findings (e.g., increased reflexes, paresthesia, paralysis), which are not present here.

An x-ray confirms the diagnosis and determines the Cobb angle, which correlates with disease severity and is used to guide management. Close observation with repeat examination and/or x-rays is usually sufficient in patients with a Cobb angle < 20°. Patients with a Cobb angle ≥ 20° should be referred to a spine specialist. Bracing is indicated in patients with a Cobb angle 25–45°. A Cobb angle > 45–50° warrants surgery (e.g., posterior spinal fusion). Severe scoliosis can lead to respiratory compromise.",

            "description": "X-ray spine (left: frontal view, right: lateral view)A severe scoliotic curvature is seen, with the Cobb angle (green overlay) of the major curve (MC) measuring 80° and the Cobb angle (red overlay) of the compensatory curve (CC) measuring 50°.A scoliosis radiograph is generally performed PA (posteroanterior) rather than AP in order to reduce breast dose. A lateral radiograph is sometimes additionally obtained.The Cobb angle measures the maximal angle between tangents placed along the upper endplate of the superior-end vertebra and the lower endplate of the inferior-end vertebra of the scoliotic curvature. Particularly if the tangents do not intersect, the Cobb angle is measured at the point of intersection between perpendicular lines drawn at each of the tangents. A Cobb angle in the range of 10-20° is considered to denote mild scoliosis, between 20-40° moderate scoliosis, and >40° severe scoliosis.",

However, patients with neuromuscular scoliosis also have other neuromuscular signs (e.g., spasticity, Gower maneuver, muscle atrophy) and rarely present solely with scoliosis. This patient's fatigue, muscle aches, and spasms in her legs that resolved after her first few training sessions are most likely normal training effects rather than due to an underlying condition.",

        "explanation_why": "The distal tibial physis is responsible for a substantial portion of tibial growth until physeal closure, which typically occurs at 12–17 years of age in women and 15–20 years of age in men. Salter-Harris fractures, which most often occur at the onset of puberty or during growth spurts, can lead to premature closure of the physis, placing individuals at risk for persistent limb-length discrepancy. Premature physeal closure is more likely to occur in Salter-Harris type III and IV fractures. Salter-Harris fractures can be managed with closed reduction and immobilization for nondisplaced fractures (typically types I and II) or open reduction and internal fixation for dislocated fractures (typically types III, IV, and V).",

Nerve injury at the time of fracture, however, typically occurs in lateral ankle or fibular fractures and manifests with an abnormal neurologic examination on presentation (e.g., dorsal foot paresthesia, foot drop, steppage gait). Furthermore, although this patient will require surgery and casting for his Salter-Harris type III fracture with displaced medial malleolus, the location of the fracture makes another complication more likely.",

Moreover, greenstick fractures usually occur in children ≤ 10 years of age, and x-rays typically show minimal angulation with disruption and bulging of the cortex on the side of the compressive force (concave side) and an intact convex side.

The investigation is usually only performed intraoperatively after other diagnoses have been ruled out and findings from other imaging modalities have supported the diagnosis of BA. In patients with suspected BA following clinical and laboratory evaluation, abdominal ultrasound is initially indicated to rule out other causes of biliary obstruction (e.g., choledochal cysts). Supportive findings of BA include the absence of a gallbladder and no dilation of the biliary tree. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy can also be considered to assess the patency of the biliary tree. Liver biopsy is usually performed to exclude other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., Alagille syndrome) and to identify changes consistent with BA, such as active inflammation with bile duct degeneration and fibrosis, portal stromal edema, and bile duct proliferation. Patients with supportive findings should undergo intraoperative cholangiography; if the diagnosis is confirmed, Kasai procedure is performed.",

She was accidentally hit in the mouth by another player's elbow and was bleeding from her mouth. She did not fall down or lose consciousness and has not had a headache, dizziness, or nausea. She only describes pain in her mouth. After rinsing her mouth, the parents found a small cut to her lip and realized her right front tooth was missing. The tooth has been located and appears to be intact. She is otherwise healthy and takes no routine medications.

        "explanation_why": "Avulsion of a permanent tooth is a dental emergency. The tooth should be manually replanted in the socket as soon as possible by the first capable individual (e.g., parent) and the patient taken to a dentist or primary care provider. The integrity and viability of the PDL cells decrease with time spent out of the socket, so successful reimplantation becomes progressively less likely. The tooth should be handled by the crown to avoid injury to the PDL, any debris removed by rinsing the tooth with tap water or saline, and the tooth reimplanted and held in place. The tooth must not be scrubbed or sterilized as these procedures damage the PDL. If immediate reimplantation is not possible, the tooth should be stored in an appropriate storage medium (e.g., Hank's Balanced Salt Solution) to prolong the viability of the PDL cells; other viable options for storage include cold milk and the patient's own saliva. The tooth should not be stored in tap water because the low osmolality of the water leads to the rupture of the PDL cells.",

Patients and their parents should also be counseled on the importance of preputial hygiene for the prevention of infection. Surgery (i.e., circumcision or vertical incision) should be considered in patients who do not respond to conservative therapy.\n\nPathologic phimosis can result from trauma (e.g., forcible retraction of the foreskin in patients with physiologic phimosis) or infection (i.e., balanitis, balanoposthitis). In patients with pathologic phimosis, topical corticosteroids and gentle stretching exercises are also considered first-line treatment, and surgery should be considered for those who do not respond to conservative management.",

Her mother reports that she has had a low-grade fever and mild cough for the past week. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Family history is remarkable for type 1 diabetes mellitus in the mother. The patient appears ill but is not in acute distress. Her temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 131/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 90/54 mm Hg. The patient cries when her neck is extended during the oropharyngeal examination. There is erythema of the tonsils and swelling of the posterior pharyngeal wall; the uvula is at the midline. Cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and mildly tender to palpation. A lateral x-ray of the neck is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, it may also appear in other conditions (e.g., bacterial tracheitis, tumors). An accompanying lateral radiograph might additionally show inspiratory overdistention of the hypopharynx.",

        "explanation_why": "A retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is a rare life-threatening polymicrobial infection (e.g., Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp.) that typically affects young children (< 5 years of age). RPA is usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and develops as a result of bacterial spread to the prevertebral space via lymphatics. In suspected cases with no signs of respiratory compromise, diagnosis is confirmed with contrast-enhanced CT scan. A lateral neck x-ray showing widening of the prevertebral space due to soft tissue swelling also supports the diagnosis.\n\nPatients with RPA require hospital admission and empiric antibiotics that treat anaerobic bacteria (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam, clindamycin). Patients with airway compromise (e.g., drooling, stridor, accessory muscle breathing, hypoxia) need to have their airways secured and immediate surgical drainage is indicated. Immediate abscess drainage is also required for patients with a large mass (> 2.5 cm) and/or symptoms that persist despite antibiotic therapy.",

Moreover, epiglottitis is uncommon in vaccinated individuals because the Hib vaccine is included in the standard immunization schedule for children < 15 months of age.

While most cases of HD manifest in the neonatal period with symptoms of distal intestinal obstruction (e.g., delayed passage of meconium, bilious vomiting), patients with mild disease (e.g., ultrashort-segment HD) may present later in childhood with growth faltering, chronic constipation with the passage of small diameter stools, and an empty ampulla on digital rectal examination. In a patient with HD, anorectal manometry shows an absent relaxation reflex of the internal anal sphincter after stretching of the rectum. The diagnosis is confirmed by a rectal biopsy that shows aganglionosis, increased acetylcholinesterase activity, and/or hyperplasia of parasympathetic fibers. Infants with HD usually require surgical correction (i.e., removal of the affected segment of the colon and attachment of the normal ganglionic intestinal ends). Those with mild disease may be treated conservatively with diet, stool softeners, and laxatives.",

Functional constipation is the most common cause of constipation in infancy and childhood and may occur after the introduction of solids into the diet. However, infants with this condition typically have large stools rather than small, narrow stools, and rectal examination often shows a fecal mass in the rectal ampulla. Moreover, this patient has alarming signs (e.g., early onset of constipation, growth faltering, empty ampulla on rectal examination), which require further evaluation before initiating therapy.",

The mother's history of celiac disease puts the patient at high risk for developing the condition. However, the history of small, narrow stools and rectal examination findings suggest a different diagnosis, for which another step in management is indicated.",

This patient did not undergo newborn screening, which includes the measurement of TSH levels, so an early diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism may have been missed. However, during the first year of life, patients with congenital hypothyroidism typically also develop features such as lethargy, hoarse cry, puffed face, macroglossia, umbilical hernia, and hypotonia. Moreover, the passage of small, narrow stools and an empty ampulla on rectal examination is not associated with hypothyroidism.",

His mother says that the bulge is only intermittently visible and increases in size with coughing. He was born via cesarean delivery at 32 weeks' gestation because of premature rupture of membranes. He has no history of serious illness and receives no medications. He appears well. Growth and development are appropriate for age. He is at the 50^th percentile for length and weight. Temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 40/min. Physical examination shows a 2 x 2-cm nontender right inguinal mass that is manually reducible with gradual pressure. Ultrasonography of the groin in supine position shows widening of the deep inguinal ring. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

While parental training on indications for obtaining medical care plays an essential role in the management of inguinal hernias in children, manual reduction should always be performed by a physician in a clinical setting! This procedure is contraindicated in patients with evidence of strangulation (e.g., erythema, warmth, or tenderness over the hernia) and extremely ill patients.

In asymptomatic patients, timely surgery should be performed to avoid complications (e.g., incarcerated hernia). Emergency surgery is not required, but referral should be obtained promptly. While waiting for elective surgery, parental training on signs and symptoms of incarceration is important because an incarcerated or strangulated hernia requires immediate action.\n\nIndirect inguinal hernias are most common among male infants and infants who are born prematurely, as they mostly result from incomplete obliteration of the processus vaginalis during fetal development. Some hernias, despite being present since birth, do not become symptomatic until adulthood.",

        "explanation_why": "Osteochondroma, which develops as a juxtacortical (parosteal) mass near the metaphysis of long bones (e.g., humerus, femur), is the most common benign bone tumor. Osteochondromas have a peak incidence between 10 and 30 years of age. Most affected individuals present with a painless palpable mass near a joint. Rarely, patients may develop localized pain, limited range of motion, and pathologic fractures. Characteristic radiographic findings include a pedunculated or sessile bony protrusion with a cartilage cap. Solitary osteochondromas, as seen here, have a very low chance of malignant transformation (approx. 1%) and usually require no further treatment. Regular monitoring may be indicated in patients with multiple osteochondromas, which have a higher chance of malignant transformation (approx. 5%). Surgical removal may be considered in patients with pathologic fractures or growing tumors that impair activities of daily living.",

His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 210/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 84/52 mm Hg. He appears pale and diaphoretic. Capillary refill is delayed at 4 seconds. Cardiac examination shows muffled heart sounds with no murmurs. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. Electrocardiography shows a narrow complex tachycardia at 210 beats per minute with regular RR intervals and retrograde P waves visible as small negative deflections immediately after the QRS complexes in leads II, III, and aVF. There is no response to vagal maneuvers and adenosine. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia most often seen in young children after cardiac surgery, particularly repairs involving the ventricular septum or near the AV node. JET originates from an automatic focus in or near the AV junction, resulting in a narrow complex, rapid, and regular tachycardia. Typically, retrograde P waves are seen immediately after each QRS complex, most clearly as negative deflections in leads II, III, and aVF. JET is notably resistant to AV nodal blocking maneuvers such as vagal stimulation or adenosine, distinguishing it from reentrant supraventricular tachycardias. An abrupt onset, hemodynamic instability, and ECG findings in a patient with recent cardiac surgery are characteristic of JET, which requires urgent identification and specific antiarrhythmic therapy to prevent cardiovascular collapse.",
