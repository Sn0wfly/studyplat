    "question_text": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of pain in her right knee. The pain is worse at the end of the day and when she walks. She says that it has become difficult for her to walk up the flight of stairs to reach her apartment. She has hypertension. Her sister has rheumatoid arthritis. She drinks two to three beers daily. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and a multivitamin. She appears anxious. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (202 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 87/min, and blood pressure is 135/83 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The right knee is not tender or erythematous; range of motion is limited. Crepitus is heard on flexion and extension of the knee. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,000/mm^3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 16 mm/h. An x-ray of the right knee is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

However, glucocorticoid injections are only indicated if active joint inflammation is present or if nonpharmacological and first-line pharmacological therapy (NSAIDs) do not provide sufficient relief to overcome functional impairment.",

        "explanation_why": "A weight loss program is one of the most important general measures to relieve symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese. Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disorder in the US. Its incidence increases with age and it commonly affects women over the age of 50 years. The knees are the most commonly affected joints, followed by the hands and hips. Because there are only a few modifiable risk factors in patients with osteoarthritis, including obesity and excessive joint loading or overuse, causal treatment is limited and weight loss is the most effective step in management at this time.\n\nIf lifestyle changes (moderate exercise, weight loss) and physical therapy do not improve symptoms or patients have persistent pain, pharmacological treatment may be required. First-line pharmacological treatment consists of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen).",

        "explanation_why": "Arthrocentesis is commonly performed in patients with joint effusions to evaluate synovial fluid for crystals (e.g., in crystal-induced arthropathies like gout), leukocytes, and gram-staining (e.g., presence of bacteria in septic arthritis). Patients with both septic arthritis and crystal-induced arthropathies can present with arthralgias and a limited range of motion. However, septic arthritis is usually associated with systemic symptoms (e.g., fever), while both conditions are typically associated with an acute onset, significant swelling, and erythema of the joint. The patient has none of these features.",

She might also have a genetic predisposition given her sister's history. However, RA most commonly affects small finger joints, and patients present with symmetrical swelling of the joints and morning stiffness that typically improves with activity. This patient has none of these symptoms, so RA is very unlikely.",

MRI can show precisely what damage has been done to the soft tissue within the knee (e.g., meniscus rupture, cruciate ligament injury). MRI is not indicated in the majority of patients with osteoarthritis unless an underlying pathology such as meniscus rupture is suspected.",

She was born at term to a 26-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2. Pregnancy was complicated by a breech presentation for which she underwent an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean section. The newborn's head circumference is 35 cm (13.7 in). She is at the 60th percentile for length and 75th percentile for weight. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The spine is normal. Abduction of the right hip after cupping the pelvis and flexing the right hip and knee causes a palpable clunk. The feet have no deformities. Ultrasonography of the hip determines the angle between lines along the bone acetabulum and the ilium is 50°. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This newborn has a positive Ortolani sign (the clunk heard and felt on abducting her flexed hip), which suggests developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The sex of the child (female) and a breech presentation are risk factors for DDH. An alpha angle (angle between lines along the bone acetabulum and the ilium) of less than 60° on ultrasound also indicates DDH.",

        "explanation_why": "In most infants, mild hip instability (e.g., the femoral head is subluxable) resolves spontaneously within the first 6–8 weeks of life, as growth of the femoral head and acetabulum reduces hip laxity. If mild hip instability is detected at neonatal screening, close observation, and repeat examination after 2–6 weeks are appropriate. However, in infants with clinical evidence of hip instability (e.g., the femoral head is dislocatable) and abnormal ultrasound findings, DDH is unlikely to resolve without treatment. These infants are at high risk of developing a functional disability and accelerated osteoarthritis in the course of their lives. Expectant management would therefore not be appropriate.",

Therefore, further maneuvers to reduce the hip are not needed. In infants with DDH older than 6 months, contractures develop around the hip joint and make hip abduction difficult. Closed reduction of the hip joint under general anesthesia would be indicated in such a scenario.",

The harness should be worn for at least 23 hours/day for 6–8 weeks. The type of abduction harness (rigid vs. nonrigid harness) used varies by region and institutional protocols.\n\nNonrigid harnesses (e.g., the Pavlik harness) are the most commonly used orthotic among patients with DDH, although recent evidence suggests rigid harnesses (e.g., von Rosen harness) are associated with better outcomes.",

The pain is intermittent, presenting at the lateral side of the hip and radiating towards the thigh. It is aggravated while climbing stairs or lying on the right side. Two weeks ago, the patient was treated with a course of oral prednisone for exacerbation of asthma. Her current medications include formoterol-budesonide and albuterol inhalers. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows tenderness to palpation over the upper lateral part of the right thigh. There is no swelling. The patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Abducting the extended right leg against the physician's resistance reproduces the pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the pelvis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) results from tendinopathy at the attachment of the gluteus medius and/or minimus muscle. GTPS affects women more frequently and manifests with lateral thigh or hip pain near the great trochanter. Typical findings include tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter, exacerbation of pain by lying on the affected side, and triggering of pain by resisted abduction, all of which are present in this patient. In patients with classic features of GTPS, imaging is not required to establish the diagnosis. X-ray is usually normal and essentially rules out bone involvement. Management of GTPS is mainly conservative and includes physical therapy and modified activities to strengthen the gluteal muscles without causing damage to the gluteal tendons from overexertion, as well as oral NSAIDs or glucocorticoid injections at the greater trochanter for pain.",

However, hip tenderness on palpation is usually absent. Classical findings of the condition, such as pain with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the hip (positive impingement test), or limitation of internal rotation and/or flexion of the hip, are also not seen in this patient. Moreover, the x-ray would show a deep acetabular socket, acetabular retroversion, or a nonspherical femoral head, with or without evidence of labral tears and osteoarthritis.",

He takes no medications.  His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 128/90 mm Hg. Examination shows old track marks on the cubital fossae bilaterally. His lumbar paraspinal muscles are firm and tense on palpation. There is no midline spinal tenderness. Flexing the hip and extending the knee while raising the leg to 70° on both sides does not cause pain. Sensation is not impaired. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Almost all cases of musculoskeletal lower back pain resolve on their own within ∼ 6 weeks. Analgesia reduces discomfort, and mild to moderate activity is associated with better outcomes than bed rest. Further testing (e.g., MRI) should be considered in patients with back pain if there is high suspicion for a serious or urgent underlying cause (e.g., spinal infection) and in individuals whose symptoms have not significantly improved after ∼ 6 weeks. Muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine or tizanidine can be used as alternatives or in combination with NSAIDs for the treatment of acute lower back pain.",

    "question_text": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease 5 years ago. The daughter reports that in the past year, her mother has become nonambulatory, can speak only a few intelligible words, and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite and progressive dysphagia, resulting in a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She has been hospitalized three times for aspiration pneumonia, and her diet now consists only of puréed food. She has no advance directives. The daughter says that she does not want her mother to return to the hospital again, but she is concerned about her ability to continue providing care alone. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but well groomed. The patient is oriented only to self. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 0/30, and Functional Assessment Staging Tool scale is 7/7. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B_12 are within the reference ranges. Her serum albumin concentration is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "question_text": "Six days after undergoing surgical repair of a hip fracture, a 71-year-old man is agitated and confused. Last night, he was restrained after multiple attempts to leave his room. His overnight nurse reported that she observed several periods of rest followed by sudden episodes of agitation without a clear trigger. He has hypertension and COPD. He previously smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years but quit 10 years ago. He drinks one glass of whiskey per day. His current medications include oxycodone, hydrochlorothiazide, and salmeterol. He appears agitated. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 141/84 mm Hg. Pulmonary examination shows a prolonged expiratory phase but no other abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. During the examination, the patient becomes violent, pulls out his intravenous line, and attempts to leave the room. He does not respond to verbal deescalation techniques, and soft restraints are used. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "The initial management of delirium includes nonpharmacologic supportive measures (e.g., reorienting the patient to time, place, and person). In patients with agitation, additional measures, such as deescalation techniques, are used. Coercive measures (e.g., physical restraints) may be necessary if the patient is actively violent. A calming medication should be used before or immediately after applying restraints to reduce the risk of injury and negative psychological consequences. An antipsychotic (e.g., haloperidol) is the calming medication of choice for refractory agitation in patients with delirium. After adequate sedation has been achieved, restraints should be removed immediately.",

She also has abdominal bloating and constipation that started 2 weeks ago. She has had no pain with defecation or change in stool form or appearance. She is upset because she has seen two other physicians who performed tests but were unable to make a diagnosis. The patient is currently on sick leave but would like to return to work as soon as possible. She often worries about having a gastric ulcer that may perforate and insists on getting an endoscopy. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She reports that she is under significant pressure from her managers because of frequent performance evaluations. She has a history of childhood asthma. She takes multivitamins and glucosamine daily to prevent arthritis. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The abdomen is mildly distended and slightly tender. The remainder of the examination, including a neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Fecal occult blood test and urea breath test are negative. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",

The diagnostic criteria include at least one of the following: disproportionate thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviors concerning one's health, excessive anxiety about illness, and inordinate time or resources spent on health concerns. Incidence of somatic symptom disorder is higher in women and in those with a history of chronic childhood illness (e.g., asthma). After ruling out any treatable medical conditions, management consists of reducing unnecessary tests and procedures by scheduling regular appointments and establishing a therapeutic alliance with a single primary care physician.

    "question_text": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of persistent pain in her right shoulder. The pain is localized to the top of the shoulder and is worse with movement. She has stiffness in the right shoulder that is worse in the morning and usually lasts 20 minutes. The patient reports that she is unable to brush her hair and has stopped going to her regular tennis lessons because of the pain. She does not recall any fall or trauma. When her right arm is passively abducted in an arc, there is pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction. When asked to lower the right arm slowly from 90 degrees of abduction, she is unable to hold her arm up and it drops to her side. Passive range of motion is normal. Injection of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine into the right subacromial space does not relieve the pain or improve active range of motion of the right arm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Subacromial impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinopathy, and rotator cuff tear can all manifest with pain exacerbated by overhead activity. This patient's pain with passive abduction between 60 and 120 degrees suggests impingement and/or rotator cuff disease, and the weakness seen on the drop arm test further narrows the diagnosis to a tear in the supraspinatus muscle of the rotator cuff. It is important to note that the sensitivity and specificity of these physical examination maneuvers are limited, especially with regard to rotator cuff tears; musculoskeletal ultrasound and/or MRI should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",

            "description": "The top image shows a cross-section of the shoulder joint.The bottom images show the progression of a degenerative rotator cuff tear. Repetitive overhead movement and/or anatomical variants of the acromion can result in inflammation of the subacromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons (left). This may progress to degeneration of the bursa and tendons (middle). As a result, the tendon fibers are less elastic and prone to tear, resulting in a rotator cuff tear (right). The supraspinatus tendon is most commonly affected.",

The genitofemoral nerve also provides sensory cutaneous innervation to the scrotum in men and to the mons pubis and labia majora in women; there are also cutaneous branches to the proximal aspect of the anteromedial thigh.

The S1 nerve root controls plantar flexion through the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, so weakness in these muscles can lead to a diminished Achilles tendon reflex and impaired toe walking. Additionally, the S1 nerve root controls sensation in the dorsolateral aspect of the thigh, the posterior calf, and the lateral side of the foot, which explains this patient's radiating pain in these regions.",

However, patients with olecranon stress fractures typically present with pain over the posterior surface of the elbow and exacerbation of pain with extension of the forearm against resistance. Given the pain on the lateral surface of the forearm and exacerbation of pain with wrist extension against resistance seen here, a different diagnosis is likely.",

Although individuals who practice racket sports are at increased risk of developing these conditions, a compression neuropathy would typically result in distal weakness in the affected arm. Cubital tunnel syndrome and pronator teres syndrome would also result in sensory loss and/or paresthesias.\n\nCompression of the posterior interosseous nerve within the radial tunnel occasionally results in pain on the lateral surface of the elbow without motor weakness, sensory deficits, or paresthesias (radial tunnel syndrome). In approximately 5% of patients, radial tunnel syndrome occurs in conjunction with lateral epicondylitis. However, in radial tunnel syndrome, pain typically affects the dorsal aspect of the proximal forearm rather than the distal humerus.",

        "explanation_why": "Underactivity of the detrusor muscle is one of the causes of overflow incontinence. Patients with an acute spinal cord injury (SCI) can have spinal shock, which is a combination of decreased sensation, flaccid paralysis, and autonomic dysfunction below the level of an SCI. Autonomic dysfunction results in parasympathetic inactivation and a consequent atonic bladder. Patients with SCI become unaware of bladder filling and feel no urge to void, resulting in an overfilled and overdistended bladder that is palpable in the suprapubic region. When intravesical pressure rises above bladder outlet resistance, involuntary dribbling of urine occurs. SCI at or below the sacral micturition center can also cause overflow incontinence due to damage to the lower motor neurons that form part of the micturition reflex arc. Urinary retention in patients with an atonic bladder is best managed by clean intermittent catheterization.\n\nAnother cause of overflow incontinence is bladder outflow obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia in men or pelvic organ prolapse and uterine fibroids in women). Bladder outlet obstruction is often associated with hesitancy and a sensation of incomplete emptying.",

    "question_text": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressive muscle pain. The pain started in the shoulder muscles and then spread to the arms, back, and legs. She often feels stiff in the morning but does not have significant joint pain. She reports that she has had trouble sleeping because of the pain and cannot concentrate during the day. Medical history is remarkable for major depressive disorder. Her only medication is sertraline. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She appears tired. Examination shows tenderness in the arms and legs and along the axial skeleton. There is no joint swelling. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 13.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10 mm/h, and a creatine kinase concentration of 55 U/L. Results of other laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "This patient's history of chronic, widespread muscle tenderness, morning stiffness, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (difficulty concentrating), and sleep disturbances, in conjunction with normal laboratory studies, suggests fibromyalgia (FM).

However, this patient does not have other common findings in SLE, such as skin involvement (e.g., the typical butterfly rash), joint pain, fever, and weight loss. PR mainly affects women older than 50 years of age and manifests with stiffness and pain in the shoulders, hips, or neck, as well as systemic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, malaise, and depressed mood).

Patients with FM should be advised to increase daily physical exercise gradually and that it is normal to initially experience a temporary worsening of myalgias. In addition, initial management of FM should include patient education (including reassurance about the disease and its prognosis and the importance of nonpharmacological measures such as sleep hygiene), treatment of comorbidities (e.g., mood and sleep disorders), and pharmacotherapy with low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline). Cyclobenzaprine, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine), or anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin) can also be used as initial pharmacotherapy.",

    "question_text": "Two weeks after undergoing below-knee amputation of the left leg, a 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of episodic sharp, shooting, and burning pain below the amputation site. She is in the military reserve and was involved in active combat 2 weeks ago, during which she sustained multiple gunshot wounds to her left lower leg resulting in irreversible limb ischemia. She is currently taking oral acetaminophen, which has provided minimal pain relief. The patient has a history of bronchial asthma for which she uses an albuterol inhaler. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 123/75 mm Hg. Physical examination of the residual limb shows mild erythema and drainage of a scant amount of serous fluid from the sutured wound. Muscle strength in the hip and upper leg is normal bilaterally. Sensation to pain and temperature is normal in the left upper leg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

She is currently taking oral acetaminophen, which has provided minimal pain relief. The patient has a history of bronchial asthma for which she uses an albuterol inhaler. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 123/75 mm Hg. Physical examination of the residual limb shows mild erythema and drainage of a scant amount of serous fluid from the sutured wound. Muscle strength in the hip and upper leg is normal bilaterally. Sensation to pain and temperature is normal in the left upper leg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Because there is insufficient research on treatment for phantom limb pain, a multimodal approach is typically recommended. Other forms of first-line treatment for phantom limb pain include mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and pharmacotherapy with NMDA receptor antagonists.

It is sharp and constant and the patient has not been able to bear any weight on his right leg since then. He has no history of serious illness and his only medication is a creatine supplement that he takes to build up muscle. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a swollen right knee that is tender to palpation along the anterior aspects. He is unable to extend his knee against gravity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-rays of his right knee show an effusion and the patella located proximal to the femoral condyles; there is no fracture.

Physical examination typically reveals anterior knee pain, effusion, and an inability to extend the knee and keep the leg straight when flexing the hip. X-rays of the knee will show a high-riding patella because of unopposed quadriceps tendon force. Partial patellar tendon tear can usually be managed conservatively with immobilization and physical therapy, while complete patellar tendon tears are managed surgically with end-to-end suturing of the patellar tendon.\n\nIn contrast, a low-riding patella indicates a tear of the quadriceps tendon.

        "explanation_why": "Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection can be used to treat chronic osteoarthritis, which can manifest with knee pain and swelling in an older individual. However, the onset of pain in osteoarthritis is insidious, rather than acute. Moreover, erythema, fever, tachycardia, and fatigue suggest an infection, which is a contraindication for intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. This patient's prepatellar swelling and normal range of motion indicate that the source of his symptoms is located outside of the joint.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Diagnostic bursal fluid aspiration is indicated in all patients who have bursitis in a superficial bursa. The aspirated fluid should be analyzed for infection via Gram stain, bacterial culture, and a white blood cell count with differential, as well as for crystal arthropathies via examination under a polarizing microscope. An immunocompromised state (e.g., monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) is a risk factor for developing septic bursitis, which can manifest acutely with local findings as well as fatigue, myalgia, and/or fever. Empiric antibiotics against staphylococci and streptococci should be initiated in this patient after fluid aspiration and adjusted according to bursal fluid culture results. Imaging is usually unnecessary unless bone involvement is suspected. Complications of bursal fluid aspiration include spread of infection to the adjacent bursa or joint.",

She is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 74 kg (163 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows moderate swelling of the left ankle and tenderness along the anterior edge of the lateral malleolus. Range of motion at the left ankle joint is limited due to pain.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The combination of ankle pain, swelling, limited range of motion, tenderness along the anterior lateral malleolus, and preserved ability to bear weight after a traumatic event suggests a lateral ankle sprain.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Ankle sprains are most commonly caused by injury of the anterior talofibular ligament due to excessive inversion of the foot. Conservative treatment for acute ankle sprains consists of protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, and elevation (POLICE principle), along with NSAIDs for analgesia. Immediately after the injury, patients should undergo a brief period of relative rest followed by mobilization exercises within a pain-free range and protected weight bearing. Conservative treatment is indicated in patients with normal x-rays and in those who do not require imaging according to the Ottawa ankle rules. Accordingly, because this patient is able to bear weight on the ankle and does not have point tenderness at the posterior edge or tip of the lateral or medial malleolus, x-rays are not required.\n\nIf ankle instability or severe pain is present, a cast boot or short leg cast can be used for a few days. Surgery may be indicated if there is ligament rupture, especially in patients who are likely to experience continuous stress on the ankle joint, such as professional athletes.",

Usually, these patients cannot bear weight on the affected ankle. This patient, however, has been able to bear weight for the past 4 days. Moreover, an ankle fracture or grade III sprain manifests with severe pain, swelling, ecchymosis, ankle instability, and tenderness along the malleolus, whereas this patient only has moderate swelling, no ecchymosis, and a stable ankle joint.",

Physical therapy should aim to strengthen and gently stretch the shoulder while avoiding aggressive exercises that would aggravate the capsular synovitis and cause undue discomfort. Patients with previous shoulder injuries and/or surgeries, diabetes mellitus, and other systemic diseases (e.g., stroke, thyroid, autoimmune) are at increased risk of developing adhesive capsulitis.",

However, this benefit does not extend beyond a few weeks and is typically not recommended due to the systemic side effects of corticosteroids (e.g., hypertension, hyperglycemia, weight gain, peptic ulcers, myopathy, psychosis). Instead, conservative measures should be trialed first. In patients who do not respond to conservative measures, intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, which have more localized effects, can be considered instead of oral steroids.",

    "question_text": "A 51-year-old woman comes to the physician because of swelling and burning pain in her left lower leg for the past 2 weeks. She fractured her left femur 2 months ago in a skiing accident and underwent intramedullary nailing. Her initial postoperative course was uncomplicated. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. She drinks one glass of wine daily and does not smoke. Her vital signs are within normal limits.

    "content_preview": "A 51-year-old woman comes to the physician because of swelling and burning pain in her left lower leg for the past 2 weeks. She fractured her left femur 2 months ago in a skiing accident and underwent intramedullary nailing. Her initial postoperative course was uncomplicated. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. She drinks one glass of wine daily and does not smoke. Her vital signs are within normal limits.

Finally, Raynaud phenomenon most commonly affects the fingers and toes. This patient's symptoms are more consistent with CRPS, which requires a different type of management.",

Physical and occupational therapy is the recommended first-line therapy for CRPS. Therapy focuses on ensuring daily function and motion of the affected limb, decreasing pain, and improving the patient's quality of life. Commonly used strategies include desensitization and relaxation techniques, gait retraining, functional activities, and edema control strategies. Patients with CRPS may also require medical therapy for pain management (e.g., oral corticosteroids).",

The pain is exacerbated when she climbs the stairs to her apartment on the 4^th floor. Treatment with ibuprofen has provided moderate pain relief. Medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin. She has smoked 4–5 cigarettes daily for 20 years. She is 165 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows tenderness to palpation on the right upper medial tibia; there is no swelling. Knee extension with passive external rotation and valgus stress does not cause pain. There is no joint instability when gentle valgus stress is applied across the knee. Examination of the left knee shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows osteophyte formation and narrowing of the joint space. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Discharge planners can be especially helpful for patients who are at high risk for adverse events after discharge and require ongoing skilled care. Discharge planning should be initiated as early as possible and includes a psychosocial assessment, discharge counseling, medication reconciliation, planning of follow-up visits, and coordination of services. The patient, their family, and future caregivers should be involved to establish a plan that meets the patient's medical needs and personal preferences. Effective discharge planning can increase patient satisfaction, reduce the duration of hospitalization, and decrease readmission rates.\n\nHome health care should be considered for patients who live at home and require complex ongoing care but are unable to travel. This form of rehabilitation reduces costs while avoiding the risks associated with prolonged hospitalization (e.g., nosocomial infections).",
