        "explanation_why": "Chronic cerebral hypoxia caused by chronic carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is the most likely cause of headache, somnolence, and fatigue in this patient. CO often rises to unsafe levels in confined areas with poor ventilation (e.g., basements), especially during winter months when furnaces are used for heating. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity ∼ 240 times stronger than that of oxygen and prevents normal oxygen delivery to cells, leading to a chronic hypoxic state. Chronic hypoxemia stimulates erythropoietin production, which causes erythrocytosis, leading to increased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit. Patients with CO poisoning often have a normal SpO_2  because pulse oximeters cannot distinguish between carboxyhemoglobin and normal oxyhemoglobin.\n\nIn patients who are obese or hypertensive, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a differential diagnosis. OSA also causes chronic cerebral hypoxia and can manifest with morning headaches, daytime somnolence, and polycythemia.",

In all other patients, a chest x-ray is only performed if the skin test is positive in order to rule out active TB. This patient has a negative TST, so a chest x-ray is not indicated.\n\nA chest x-ray may also be performed as part of the initial diagnostic workup in patients with respiratory symptoms (productive cough, dyspnea) and/or systemic symptoms in order to narrow down the differential diagnoses (e.g., active TB). This patient only has mild respiratory symptoms that do not warrant a chest x-ray at this point.",

        "explanation_why": "In patients with no risk factors, a tuberculin skin test (TST) is positive if the induration is ≥ 15 mm. Negative TST indicates that the patient has not been infected with TB or has been infected recently, and not enough time has elapsed for the body to react to the skin test. This patient has no signs or symptoms that suggest active or latent infection, so no further management is indicated at this time. The threshold for a positive TST depends on the patient's individual risk factors. (See “Positive TST according to induration diameter” table.)\n\nNote that routine screening for latent TB infection (LTBI) has been replaced by a targeted screening strategy that mainly includes patients at high risk of infection or disease progression. However, there are some exceptions, such as baseline TB assessment of health care workers and volunteers. LTBI testing is typically not recommended for individuals with low risk of exposure; exceptions include local regulations that mandate broader testing policies.",

Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 mL of turbid fluid.

Malignant effusion is caused by cancer-related barrier dysfunction of the capillary walls, which leads to increased permeation of plasma protein, blood cells, and tumor cells. These effusions are usually exudative and cell-rich, with a cloudy or straw-like appearance, abnormal cytology, a glucose concentration < 60 mg/dL, pH < 7.2, and high concentrations of LDH (> 0.45 x normal serum LDH) and amylase (> 200 mg/dL).\n\nIn addition to addressing the underlying malignancy, symptomatic malignant pleural effusions can be treated with therapeutic thoracocentesis and, if the effusion is expected to reaccumulate rapidly or frequently, an indwelling pleural catheter or chemical pleurodesis.",

He reports that it is becoming gradually more difficult to care for her. She occasionally has tantrums and there are times when she does not recognize him. She sleeps 6–8 hours throughout the day and is increasingly agitated and confused at night. When the phone, television, or oven beeps she thinks she is at the dentist's office and becomes very anxious. She eats 2–3 meals a day and has a good appetite. She has not fallen. She has not left the home in weeks except for short walks. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She takes levothyroxine, aspirin, warfarin, donepezil, verapamil, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin daily.  Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. It is important to the family that the patient continues her care at home. Which of the following recommendations is most appropriate at this time?",

Although this patient is agitated and has been having difficulty sleeping, pharmacological treatment would only be indicated if nonpharmacological interventions had failed. Behavioral therapies have the same or increased efficacy compared to antipsychotic medications in this patient population.",

This patient's anxiety is likely a consequence of her dysregulated sleep (i.e., nighttime insomnia and daytime hypersomnia) and resulting disorientation.

Heat-induced damage to the vascular endothelium results in the release of cytokines and heat shock proteins that cause leukocytosis (due to a systemic inflammatory response) and DIC, which would explain this patient's thrombocytopenia and multiorgan dysfunction.",

Prostaglandin E2 concentration increases as a response to endogenous and exogenous pyrogens and displaces the set point of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center upward. Since increased body temperature in heatstroke develops as a result of impaired heat dissipation, and it is not cytokine-induced, antipyretics are not effective in the treatment of heatstroke. Administration of acetaminophen or NSAIDs may even be harmful as it can exacerbate complications including acute kidney injury, hepatic failure, and the risk of bleeding in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.",

She has had no prenatal care. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, and regular contractions are felt every 2 minutes. The uterus is consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. There is blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of the thighs. Ultrasound shows complete detachment of the placenta from the uterus. Fetal heart tones are absent. An emergency cesarean delivery is performed. Following the procedure, the patient becomes tearful and distraught. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Empathic communication is critical following perinatal loss. Physicians should acknowledge the loss, validate the patient’s emotions, and offer compassionate support using clear, sensitive language. The PEARLS model and NURS model provide effective frameworks to respond to intense emotions like sadness, anger, or fear. Key steps include naming the emotion, expressing empathy and understanding, and offering supportive statements (e.g., “I’m so sorry for your loss,” “This is a very difficult time”), while avoiding overly personalized remarks such as “I know what you are going through.” When appropriate, parents should be offered the opportunity to see and hold their baby, as this can support the grieving process and reduce the risk of long-term psychiatric complications. These responses legitimize the patient’s grief, foster trust, and allow space to process the loss before further discussion.",

Results from a peripheral blood smear taken during his evaluation are indicative of possible acute myeloid leukemia. Bone marrow aspiration and subsequent cytogenetic studies confirm the diagnosis. The physician sets aside an appointed time-slot and arranges a meeting in a quiet office to inform the patient about the diagnosis and discuss his options. He has been encouraged to bring someone along to the appointment if he wanted. He comes to the office at the appointed time with his daughter. He appears relaxed, with a full range of affect.

Disclosing the diagnosis is an important part of delivering serious news but the diagnosis should be communicated in a step-by-step manner that involves reviewing the examination and diagnostic findings with the patient and ensuring that he/she understands what is being said at each step. Technical terms such as “leukemia” should be explained in a way that the layman understands. Moreover, the diagnosis should only be disclosed after obtaining the patient's invitation to discuss it. Seeking the patient's permission to deliver the diagnosis provides an important clue on how much the patient wants to know.

The lesions typically grow back after they are scraped off. Initially, actinic keratosis manifests as small lesions with a central scale and a rough surface, giving them a sandpaper-like texture on palpation. Later, the lesions may grow and become erythematous and scaly, as seen in this patient. The risk of progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma depends on the degree of epithelial dysplasia, but it is < 1% per year. Occasionally, hyperkeratosis may turn preexisting actinic keratosis lesions into cutaneous horns.\n\nActinic keratosis is usually a clinical diagnosis, although for lesions that are ≥ 1 cm, grow rapidly, or do not respond to treatment, a biopsy is necessary to distinguish it from squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment options include cryotherapy for isolated lesions, or 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, or photodynamic therapy in patients with multiple lesions.",

It began about 1 month ago and seems to be getting worse. He has also developed a dry cough. He has not had any wheezing, fevers, chills, recent weight loss, or shortness of breath at rest. He has a history of Hodgkin lymphoma, for which he was treated with chemotherapy and radiation to the chest 7 years ago. He also has hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril. Ten years ago, he retired from work in the shipbuilding industry. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily since the age of 21. Vital signs are within normal limits. On lung auscultation, there are mild bibasilar crackles. A plain x-ray of the chest shows bilateral ground-glass opacities at the lung bases and bilateral calcified pleural plaques. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's current condition?",

He has worked as a car salesman for 15 years and worked in a shipyard before that for 22 years. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 13 years but stopped 25 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Fine expiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening in both lungs. A photomicrograph from a sputum sample is shown. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes. Chest x-ray in reactivation TB typically shows multiple cavities in the upper lobes, calcifications, patchy consolidations, and features fibroproliferative disease (e.g, scarring) due to inflammatory tissue destruction.",

He has a history of gout, benign prostate hyperplasia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with allopurinol, tamsulosin, and metformin. Urinalysis shows pyuria, leukocyturia, and WBC casts. Results of blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient is diagnosed with pyelonephritis and admitted for empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 4 days, his symptoms have continued to worsen. He is somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. Temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. He is transferred to the intensive care unit and vasopressor therapy is initiated. The physician informs the patient's wife that her husband has developed urosepsis as a complication of his urinary tract infection and that advanced life support may become necessary. A written advance directive provided by the patient's primary care physician includes a do-not-intubate (DNI) order, which was verbally confirmed by the patient upon admission. There is no medical power of attorney. The patient's wife says she wants full life support in case of cardiorespiratory arrest. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

The patient's wishes should be honored even if family members disagree. This patient's living will includes a DNI order that he confirmed upon admission; therefore, he should not be intubated. Because this patient does not have a DNR order, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other resuscitative measures may be performed if needed. Patients who retain their decision-making capacity may revoke advance directives at any time. If a patient is incapacitated, only a durable medical power of attorney can override an advance directive, living will, DNI, or DNR.\n\nA patient's code status (e.g., the presence of a DNR or DNI) should be confirmed verbally with the patient or their appropriate surrogate and documented at each hospital admission.",

He had forgotten to remove his contact lenses before going to sleep. After removing the contact lenses, he experienced immediate pain, discomfort, and watering of the left eye. He reports that the foreign body sensation persists and that rinsing with water has not improved the pain. He has been wearing contact lenses for 4 years and occasionally forgets to remove them at night. He has no history of serious medical illness. On examination, the patient appears distressed with pain and photophobia in the left eye. Administration of a topical anesthetic relieves the pain. Visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes. Ocular motility and pupillary response are normal. Corneal reflex is normal and symmetric in both eyes. Which of the following is most likely to establish the diagnosis in this patient?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "Eye pain, excessive tearing, photophobia, and foreign body sensation that appear acutely after the removal of an overworn contact lens are suggestive of a corneal abrasion. Although visual acuity is preserved in corneal abrasion, this patient has a previous history of wearing contact lenses and decreased visual acuity in both eyes, suggesting a refractive error.",

        "explanation_why": "Fluorescein examination is the test of choice for identifying a corneal abrasion. Corneal abrasions are defects in the corneal epithelium that often occur secondary to corneal trauma. Removal of contact lenses after wearing them overnight is likely to have caused a corneal abrasion in this patient. Fluorescein dye specifically stains the epithelial defects, making them easily identifiable on slit lamp, ophthalmoscopic, or Wood lamp examination. In addition, the conjunctival surface of the eyelids should be examined to rule out a foreign body such as a retained contact lens. In corneal abrasion, photophobia can be attributed to spastic miosis resulting from the trigeminal sensation of the cornea.",

Abnormalities that can be detected on ultrasound include retinal detachments and vitreous hemorrhage.

The affected extremity should be immersed in a warm (preferably 37–39°C), circulating water bath. Passive rewarming is also helpful (especially in patients with mild hypothermia) and includes removing any wet clothes, covering with blankets, and increasing the temperature of the room.\n\nIn patients with concomitant moderate-to-severe hypothermia, treatment of hypothermia should take priority because it can be acutely life-threatening. The trunk should be warmed prior to the extremities, as peripheral vasodilation may lead to a return of cold blood to the heart, which increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.",

A surgeon who transects the common bile duct instead of the cystic duct has made an active error.\n\nThis error is also a preventable adverse event that would have likely been avoided with meticulous surgical dissection. If the wrong duct were transected because of poor visualization, converting to an open cholecystectomy may have prevented the error.\n\nSee \"Overview of medical error types\" table.",

The lesions typically grow back after they are scraped off. As a landscaper, this man has likely spent a lot of time working outdoors and has been frequently exposed to sun. Initially, actinic keratosis present as small, erythematous lesions with a central scale and a rough surface, giving them a sandpaper-like texture on palpation. Later, the lesions may grow and become erythematous and scaly, as seen in this patient. The risk of progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma depends on the degree of epithelial dysplasia, but it is < 1% per year. Occasionally, hyperkeratosis may turn pre-existing actinic keratosis lesions into cutaneous horns.\n\nActinic keratosis is usually a clinical diagnosis, although in some cases a biopsy of the lesion may be necessary to distinguish it from squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment options include cryotherapy for isolated lesions, or 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod or photodynamic therapy in patients with multiple lesions, such as this man.",

While this patient's occupation as a landscaper puts him at risk of contracting this disease, sporotrichosis manifests initially as a papule at the site of inoculation, which often ulcerates. Subsequently, subcutaneous nodules and ulcers develop as the fungus spreads proximally along the lymphatic vessels (nodular ascending lymphangitis). This patient's recurrent crusty lesions on the dorsal surface of his hands are not consistent with sporotrichosis.",

He recently returned from a 6-month medical deployment to Indonesia. He appears tired. Physical examination shows nontender, enlarged, palpable cervical lymph nodes. An x-ray of the chest shows right-sided hilar lymphadenopathy. A sputum smear shows acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is made from PCR testing of the sputum. The patient requests that the physician does not inform anyone of this diagnosis because he is worried about losing his job.

An x-ray of the chest shows right-sided hilar lymphadenopathy. A sputum smear shows acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is made from PCR testing of the sputum. The patient requests that the physician does not inform anyone of this diagnosis because he is worried about losing his job. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?",

This patient is newly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and poses an infectious risk to the general public. Therefore, disclosure of the diagnosis and other pertinent information (e.g., drug susceptibility testing) to the public health department is necessary. Some local health departments will investigate close contacts for potential referral for evaluation and treatment.",

However, given that this patient has been diagnosed with a condition (active pulmonary tuberculosis) that is immediately relevant to the health and welfare of other people, an exception to patient confidentiality is required.

In practice, however, culture is not a practical means of establishing the diagnosis because growth can take up to 6 weeks. In this patient with a positive acid-fast stain and a positive PCR, the likelihood that he has tuberculosis is > 95%. A different step is more appropriate at this time in this patient.",

Employing strategies that aim to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and therapeutic alliance, such as scheduling frequent follow-up visits, and a patient-centered approach often improve patients' medication adherence. Frequent follow-up visits also enable closer monitoring of the patient's medication use. Other strategies to improve medication adherence include providing written instructions, optimizing the treatment plan (e.g., prescribing once-daily scheduled medications when possible), and using the teach-back method.",

        "explanation_why": "Physicians are required by law to report certain transmissible infectious diseases (e.g., HIV) to public health authorities (typically the local and/or state health department), which then reports anonymized information to the CDC. During testing, patients should be informed that HIV is a notifiable disease. Patients diagnosed with HIV should be encouraged to disclose their status to their sexual and/or needle-sharing partners. Many states also have partner notification laws that legally require disclosure of HIV status to exposed third parties, either by the patient, the health department, or the physician. Public health officials provide partner notification services for locating and notifying third parties if the patient declines to do so. Regardless of which method is used, exposed partners should be provided with resources for counseling, testing, and treatment.",

        "explanation_why": "Although physicians can assist patients in disclosing their HIV status, this patient is reluctant to notify his wife. Therefore, scheduling a group meeting is unlikely to be productive. Furthermore, because a physician's right to disclose a patient's HIV status varies by state, notifying the spouse could breach patient confidentiality laws. If a patient declines to disclose their HIV status to their partners, the physician should use confidential partner notification services, which are typically provided by public health authorities.",

His laboratory studies are notable for an elevated anion gap AG = 137 - (99 + 8) = 30 and an elevated osmolar gap (32 mOsmol/kg H_2O).

These metabolites collect in the renal system and are detectable in the urine as oxalate crystals, which can cause flank pain, hematuria, oliguria, and acute kidney injury. Hypocalcemia, the cause of this patient's tetany, is a result of calcium being consumed by oxalate to form calcium oxalate. Other signs of ethylene glycol poisoning include altered mental status and tachypnea (due to respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis). Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning consists of fomepizole to competitively inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase, as ethylene glycol itself is not nearly as toxic as its metabolites.",

The cough is productive of thick, mucoid, blood-tinged sputum. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F) and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination shows coarse inspiratory crackles over the right lung field. Sputum cultures grow gram-negative, encapsulated bacilli that are resistant to amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and aztreonam. Which of the following infection control measures is most appropriate for preventing transmission of this organism to other patients in the hospital?",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "Fever, productive cough, and localized crackles are suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's currant jelly sputum, residency in an assisted living facility, alcohol use disorder, and findings of gram-negative, encapsulated bacilli make healthcare-associated Klebsiella pneumonia a likely diagnosis. Sputum cultures show multi-drug resistance, raising suspicion for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) strain of this bacteria.",

Support groups are one of the best ways for patients with chronic illness to connect with other people who have undergone similar experiences and to get information about their conditions. Attending a support group can help reduce feelings of isolation and build a sense of community. Patients with cystic fibrosis should avoid direct contact with other affected individuals to prevent cross-infection. While in-person support groups hold the risk of transmission of harmful bacteria between patients, virtual support groups are a reasonable alternative that is preferred in these patients.\n\nKeep in mind that multiple choice exams ask for the single best answer, which is particularly challenging with statement-type answer options. In clinical practice, there is usually more than one correct way to reply to a patient. In exams, it is important to identify the answer choice with the most correct information, even if you prefer different wording.",

These laws require the health care provider to evaluate aspects such as the identity of the person at risk, imminence and certainty of the harm, and type of harm (e.g., physical harm, death) before making a decision. In this scenario, although the patient has expressed that he does not plan on hurting someone other than in self-defense, it is unclear if he can distinguish benign from hostile actions, and there is a potential threat to the neighbor's life if he brings him the newspaper again.\n\nThis patient should undergo evaluation for schizophrenia and, if the diagnosis is confirmed, receive antipsychotic treatment. Most patients with schizophrenia are treated on an outpatient basis, and it is better to have the patient voluntarily receive care before considering civil commitment. If this patient were to receive outpatient care (voluntarily or through community treatment orders), law enforcement authorities should be informed so that they can warn the person at risk (e.g., the neighbor of the potential risk of going near the patient's house). Law enforcement authorities (e.g., judicial magistrate) should also be notified after involuntary admission.",

When the physician starts to mention possible diagnoses, the patient interrupts her and says that he does not want to know the diagnosis and that she should just do whatever she thinks is right. A biopsy of the skin lesion is performed and histological examination shows clusters of infiltrative melanocytes. Upon repeat questioning, the patient reaffirms his wish to not know the diagnosis.

It is typically asymptomatic, but large hepatic hemangiomas can cause nonspecific symptoms (e.g., abdominal discomfort, early satiety, nausea). On histology, endothelium-lined blood-filled sinuses that stain positive for endothelial markers, including PECAM-1, are characteristic. However, normal flat endothelial cells rather than pleomorphic spindle cells would be seen. Moreover, cavernous hemangiomas are most common in adults between 30–50 years of age and, given their benign nature, would be unlikely to cause significant weight loss or hepatomegaly.",

In addition to this ethical duty, there are also legal requirements, especially if impairment is strongly suspected (e.g., if there is reasonable evidence or impairment has been witnessed first-hand). The laws and exact wording vary from state to state and physicians should be familiar with the requirements of their state of practice.\n\nThe PHP is supervised by the state medical board and aims to prevent, detect, and manage disorders that cause physician impairment. After the PHP receives a report, which can be submitted anonymously, a thorough assessment of the potentially impaired physician is performed. If impairment is confirmed, management options are offered; the PHP is not obliged to notify the state medical board about the impaired physician's condition if the physician voluntarily accepts treatment. If the physician refuses treatment, the PHP will report the physician's condition to the state medical board, which may lead to an involuntary referral for treatment and disciplinary action. After treatment, the PHP monitors the physician with regular assessments and/or laboratory tests for 1–5 years depending on the condition underlying the impairment.",

Furthermore, a focus on didactic education is not a point of emphasis in systems approaches to medical error, of which root cause analysis is one tool.",

A root cause analysis is a retrospective analysis that is aimed at identifying a medical error that led to an adverse event, i.e., understanding who was affected by the event, what happened (identifying active errors), where it happened, when it happened, and why the event occurred (identifying latent errors). To identify latent errors that may have aligned to cause the adverse event, various factors are considered, such as the physical environment (e.g., the bed was malfunctioning and the patient could not be placed in the Trendelenburg position), team environment (e.g., a technician noticed that one of the catheter connections was detached but did not feel empowered to report her observation), regulatory pressures (e.g., the resident was rushing because he was at risk of exceeding duty hours), and patient-related factors (e.g., he was hypovolemic). Using the Swiss cheese model of error causation, the origins of the adverse event can be uncovered.\n\nA root cause analysis is performed after an event has occurred, and its purpose is to produce recommendations for interventions that prevent similar events from occurring in the future.",

        "explanation_why": "In most instances, gifts represent an expression of gratitude or a cultural tradition (e.g., gifts given during holidays). Physicians should be sensitive to the value and intent of a patient's gift, communicating effectively when declining a gift that doing so has professional reasons and that the rejection will not affect the therapeutic alliance with the patient. Nevertheless, physicians should avoid accepting any gifts (now and in the future) that are very personal or intimate in nature, very large, and/or potentially valuable.",

        "explanation_why": "There is a general consensus that physicians should decline gifts from patients and pharmaceutical companies to avoid potential conflicts of interest and conveying the impression of favoritism or preferential treatment. Physicians should especially avoid accepting gifts that are very large and/or potentially valuable (e.g., a framed painting, jewelry, etc.) and could be regarded as a payoff. Gifts of a very personal or intimate nature (e.g., a family heirloom or an invitation to a dinner date) should also be declined as accepting them could be regarded as transgressing the boundaries of a professional relationship.\n\nThe American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics permits the acceptance of gifts of substantial monetary value by physicians under certain conditions bound to strict recommendations (e.g., gifts that benefit patients, support medical education, etc.).",

The patient notes that she would be comfortable with being referred to specialists by her primary care physician. Which of the following health insurance plans would be most appropriate?",

        "explanation_why": "In preferred provider organizations, patients do not need to see a primary care physician before seeing a specialist. Because the insurance covers care delivered by out-of-network providers, monthly rates are generally very high. Additionally, patients are required to cover out-of-pocket costs for many aspects of care. Because this patient specifically mentioned she would like affordable monthly payments, a preferred provider organization would not be the appropriate recommendation for her.",

There is no coverage for visiting providers outside of the network. Other than in an emergency, seeing a provider outside of the patient's network means that the patients will have to pay the full cost of care themselves. Although monthly premiums are initially low for healthy patients, medical treatment for a serious illness that might develop later can be very costly.",

Usually, patients have to pay extra fees to see providers outside of the network, which is aimed at keeping fixed monthly premiums moderate. The primary care physician still acts as the gatekeeper for access to specialists.

This payment model is often used for reimbursement of inpatient services. For example, a hospital and payer can negotiate a fixed per diem rate for most routine inpatient services (e.g., common medical and surgical conditions) based on the average daily cost of admission. This model does not reflect the scenario described, in which health care providers receive a fixed amount for each patient enrolled over a specific period of time, regardless of whether or not services are provided.",

They are not paid a fixed amount for each patient enrolled over a specific period of time, regardless of the amount of care provided, as described in this case.

They are not paid a fixed amount for each patient enrolled over a specific period of time, regardless of the amount of care provided, as described in this case. Preferred provider organizations often use a discounted FFS payment model. As in a traditional FFS payment model, a discounted FFS payment model carries the risk that patients will be overtreated because compensation is based on the amount of service provided. However, because discounted prices are predetermined by negotiations between health care providers and payers, the financial incentive to provide excess care is decreased.",

        "explanation_why": "Capitation is a health care payment model in which health care providers receive a specified amount of compensation per patient during each payment period, regardless of the actual amount of health care utilized by the patient. Capitation incentivizes health care providers to promote efficient use of health care resources (e.g., cost-effective preventive health care to avoid larger downstream costs). Risks of capitation include provision of substandard care as a method of cost reduction and rejection of medically complex patients from patient panels by providers to reduce negative impacts on the ability to meet quality metrics.",

Goals of hospice care include the palliation of symptoms for comfort (e.g., opioid analgesics for pain, sedatives for agitation), improvement of patient and caregiver independence (e.g., freedom from wall-mounted oxygen supplementation, assistance from nursing staff), and preservation of patient dignity (e.g., removal of intravenous lines, minimization of physical examinations).",

However, one fundamental aspect of hospice care is the principle of double effect, which describes the tendency to tolerate and accept the negative effects of a management strategy (e.g., respiratory depression) because of the positive effects of that strategy (e.g., pain control). The use of opioid analgesics is appropriate for this patient with worsening pain. Many patients on hospice care use long-acting opioid analgesics, which are associated with a higher risk of developing respiratory depression compared to short-acting formulations.",

He has had gradually increasing difficulties hearing conversations in crowded places, which he first noticed 3 years ago. He has also felt depressed, and he noticed that he regularly thinks back to his time in the military. The patient retired from the military 1 month ago when he returned from a deployment to Syria where he was involved in active combat. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. His vital signs are within normal limits. Otoscopic examination shows a clear translucent tympanic membrane with a normal light reflex. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the right mastoid process. Immediately after the patient stops hearing a tone, the tuning fork is held over the right ear and he reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the left side and shows the same pattern. The vibrating tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound in the center of his head. The results of an audiogram are shown. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's impaired hearing?",

However, in initial stages, the hearing loss in this condition would usually have a fluctuating course, be accompanied by a sensation of ear fullness, and primarily affect low frequencies. In addition, Meniere disease typically manifests with acute episodes of severe peripheral vertigo (a component of the Meniere triad). In contrast, this patient does not report vertigo or ear fullness and has progressive high-frequency hearing loss, while Meniere disease typically causes low to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.",

However, the hearing loss in this condition is conductive rather than sensorineural; therefore, a negative rather than positive Rinne test would be expected. Moreover, patients with otosclerosis hear better in crowded environments (paracusis willisii) and have a characteristic notched hearing loss at 2 kHz (Carhart notch) on an audiogram unlike this patient who has difficulty hearing in crowded places and a notch at 3–4 kHz. Additionally, otoscopic examination in patients with active otosclerosis would usually reveal a red-blue hue seen through the tympanic membrane (Schwartze sign) as opposed to a clear, translucent tympanic membrane with a normal light reflex.",

However, sensorineural hearing loss in this condition results from rupture of the oval window membrane and would be accompanied by nausea and vertigo. More commonly, barotrauma manifests with conductive hearing loss, which would show a different pattern on tuning fork tests and audiogram. In addition, symptom onset is sudden rather than progressive and affected patients typically present with a feeling of pressure and/or stabbing ear pain.

        "explanation_why": "Repeated exposure to sounds above a threshold of 85 dB (e.g., motorcycle) or a single exposure to sounds above 120 dB (e.g., gunshots, jet takeoffs) can lead to noise-induced hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by irreversible damage to the stereocilia of the hair cells in the organ of Corti. Deployed military personnel, like this patient, have a high occupational risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss. Such hearing loss is slowly progressive and affects high frequencies (3–4 kHz) first, which results in difficulty hearing in crowded environments. Tinnitus is often an associated symptom. There is no definitive treatment available (besides hearing aids); therefore, prevention with appropriate hearing protection is essential. In addition to sensorineural hearing loss, exposure to sudden noise louder than 120 dB can cause conductive hearing loss through rupture of the tympanic membrane.\n\nHearing loss is a risk factor for depressive disorders, which are common among veterans.",

Which of the following actions by the hospital staff would most likely have been a HIPAA violation?",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "HIPAA requires covered entities (i.e., health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers) to take all measures necessary to protect the privacy, integrity, and security of both electronic and paper-based protected health information (PHI).",

After the last contact with a patient, state laws specify a period (ranging from 5 to 30 years) that must be observed before the patient's PHI can be destroyed. HIPAA allows covered entities to hire vendors or third-party business associates to destroy electronic or paper-based PHI (e.g., by burning, shredding, magnetization) as well as dispose of the remains outside the hospital as long as the covered entity has a contractual agreement with the third party in which the third party is required to follow HIPAA provisions.",

        "content": "Sending protected health information from a personal electronic mail address",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Covered entities should only access or transmit electronic protected health information (ePHI) from a system that has technical safeguards to generate audit trails (i.e., access logs to identify all individuals who interact with ePHI) and prevent unauthorized access (e.g., password protection, automatic logoffs, encryption, secure networks). The transmission of PHI to or from a health care provider's personal electronic mail is a severe violation of the HIPAA Security Rule and may even result in the health care provider being charged with data theft because it leaves the PHI vulnerable to third parties. Other examples of HIPAA Security Rule violations include downloading PHI on an unauthorized device and leaving PHI in a place accessible to third parties. These violations are likely to occur when health care providers interact with PHI in an unsecured system (e.g., at home to complete patient notes, at a workstation that is accessible to patients, discussing care with a colleague over texting applications). The HIPAA Security Rule also requires covered entities to implement administrative safeguards (e.g., training personnel about HIPAA provisions) and physical safeguards (e.g., locking cabinets or data servers with PHI, privacy filters for computer screens) to ensure that PHI is generated, stored, accessed, and transmitted securely.\n\nViolations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule include releasing PHI without patient authorization, after the expiry of the authorization time limit, or to unauthorized individuals (e.g., health care providers not involved in the patient's care). The exceptions to the requirement for patient authorization include disclosures for treatment, payment (e.g., claim reimbursement), and health care operations as well as disclosures mandated by law (e.g., notifiable diseases, elder or child abuse, organ or body donation). In these cases, the degree of disclosure must be limited based on the minimum necessary standard.",

This means that physicians may call out a patient's name in the waiting room or use patient sign-in sheets, even though other patients might accidentally overhear or see the patient's identity, as long as the information disclosed is appropriately limited and information not relevant to identification of the patient (e.g., the medical reason for the patient's visit) is kept confidential.",

Today, an abdominal x-ray shows a large bowel obstruction. The patient appears lethargic and thin. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She expresses that she does not want to receive any lifesaving procedures. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of her decision. The patient's eldest daughter, who is in the emergency department, says that she wants her mother to receive all necessary measures to stay alive.

This patient has demonstrated that she has decision-making capacity, and therefore her wishes should be followed. The surrogate health care decision-maker is only permitted to make a decision on the patient's behalf if the patient's decision-making capacity is compromised.

He recently had unprotected sex with his girlfriend, who is the same age as him. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test for Chlamydia trachomatis is positive. The patient says that his girlfriend knows about his symptoms, but he does not want his parents to be notified of his sexual activity or his positive test for a sexually transmitted infection because they do not approve of premarital sex. He adds that he wants to avoid any further conflicts with his mother, as they have been fighting recently. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

Accordingly, the physician is ethically and legally obliged to keep his medical information confidential (though minors should, in general, be counseled to have open discussions about health with their parents or legal guardians). However, because this patient has a notifiable disease (Chlamydia trachomatis infection), the physician is required to report the case to a public health official.\n\nOther exceptions to when parental consent is generally not needed for a minor to receive medical care include emergency care, care related to addiction, and care related to sexual behavior (e.g., contraception, pregnancy).",

The patient and her family, including her mother and father, have all been in the physician's care for the past 20 years, and the patient regularly accompanies her parents to their appointments. During the examination, the patient mentions that she is concerned that her 70-year-old father has recently bought a parcel of land and now wants to build a new home on it. Her father worked as a contractor for 30 years before going into retirement and plans to build the house himself with only minor help from other contractors. The patient explains that she is worried her father will injure himself while working on the house and “dig himself into a financial hole.” She asks the physician whether he could speak to her father about his plans and explain to him that these would be too much of a physical and financial risk for a person of his age. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement by the physician at this time?",

During the examination, he tells the physician that he has been having marital issues with his wife. He filed for bankruptcy 2 months ago for a business he had owned with his brother until his brother died of skin cancer a year ago. He has tried to hide his financial issues from his wife and explains that he is feeling increasingly desperate and no longer “sees the light at the end of the tunnel.” He worries about finances and what would happen if he developed cancer like his brother, and then cannot fall asleep. In the morning, he feels tired and finds it hard to start the day. The patient says the symptoms began a few months after his brother's death and then, “Everything started to fall apart. I can't concentrate, my wife will probably leave me soon, and now I have lost the business.” Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Through this reaction, the physician shows empathy and specifically asks about suicidal ideation. Assessing a patient's suicide risk is the most important diagnostic step for any depressed individual. If the patient confirms that he is having suicidal ideation, the physician should also ask the patient if he has thought of a means of suicide (suicidal plan), assess the degree to which he intends to put the plan into action (suicidal intent), and evaluate whether additional risk factors for suicide completion are present (e.g., possession of a firearm, personal and family history of prior suicide attempts). If the patient is suicidal, they should be admitted to the hospital. Treatment of a major depressive episode often requires a combination of antidepressants, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.",

Although it could be normal for the patient to occasionally have some of his symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, decreased sleep, decreased concentration) as a part of grief, it is not normal to have them on a persistent basis or have unexplained weight loss over 8 months. Moreover, by saying, “You will see that things will become easier for you over time!\" the physician is making promises that cannot be guaranteed.",

However, the symptoms of grief tend to occur in waves (grief pangs), decrease over time, and are not associated with functional impairment or feelings of desperation.

One year ago, he had tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He undergoes a CT-guided needle biopsy of the spinal lesion and is awaiting the pathology result. A medical student, who is part of the team involved in the patient's care, sees the patient in the hospital cafeteria. The student has just reviewed the patient's spinal biopsy result, which is consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of oropharyngeal origin. The patient approaches the student in the cafeteria and asks if the biopsy result has come back. Which of the following is the most appropriate response?",

Patients with coal workers' pneumoconiosis present with symptoms of chronic bronchitis, which can progress to severe dyspnea indicating massive pulmonary fibrosis. Inhaled carbon particles accumulate in alveolar macrophages and induce inflammation and fibrosis of the lung parenchyma.

If he were to develop this complication, he would likely present with concurrent symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, more rapidly progressive shortness of breath, chest x-ray findings of more peripheral and/or larger nodules, and biopsy findings similar to those seen in rheumatoid nodules (i.e., central fibrinoid necrosis with histiocytes and surrounding epithelial cells).",

Some of the pigment can be found in pigment-laden macrophages. Also, collagenous fibrosis is predominant throughout the lung tissue.This appearance is diagnostic of pneumoconiosis (e.g., coal workers' pneumoconiosis).",

Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. CT scan of the head shows a massive intracranial bleed. After a brain death examination and an apnea test, the patient is declared brain dead. The patient has no living will or advance directives regarding organ donation and was legally competent before her death. She is survived by her 17-year-old son, elder brother, and parents. Her son is currently on a camping trip outside the country. The physician informs the local organ procurement organization, and a representative from the organization inquires with the family about donating the deceased's organs. The patient's brother permits organ donation, whereas her parents strongly disagree. The physician and the representative encourage a family meeting, but the family cannot reach an agreement on the patient's most likely wish regarding organ donation. The hospital ethics committee is convened and recommends adhering to the state law in this case. In most states, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management regarding organ donation?",

        "explanation_why": "If there is a disagreement between the next of kin on the most appropriate course of action, it is appropriate for the physician to first encourage a meeting between disagreeing family members with the aim of reaching an agreement about what the deceased would have desired. However, such a meeting has already been arranged, and there are no grounds to assume that a second meeting with a social worker would provide further clarification. Most states generally establish a clear hierarchy for who would be assigned as the SDM among the next of kin.",

Most states have established a hierarchy to assign a next of kin as the SDM, although the order may vary from state to state. Spouses are most often listed first, followed by adult children, parents, adult siblings, and close friends. Fiancés and nonlegal partners are not considered spouses in most states, and adulthood is typically defined as 18 years of age. In this case, the patient's parents, who are not in favor of organ donation, would serve as this patient's representatives. The organ donation process should therefore be stopped.",

This means that more resources will be directed to the individuals who need them the most and patients will be spared from undergoing unnecessary procedures that may be more harmful than beneficial. For example, this patient, who underwent a total hysterectomy, is no longer at risk for cervical cancer and therefore does not require further Pap smears or screening for human papillomavirus. One way of improving resource stewardship is the lean process improvement method, in which factors that use time, energy, and resources but do not improve patient outcomes (also referred to as “waste”) are continuously identified and eliminated.",

    "question_text": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for a routine health examination. According to the patient's mother, the boy has been more withdrawn lately and has also lost some weight, which she finds “suspicious.” Their family moved from a different state 6 months ago. The boy has some difficulty making friends at the new school but has good academic performance. He enjoys playing drums and has a good appetite. The patient says he tried beer before but does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. His vital signs are normal. Physical and mental status examinations show no abnormalities. The physician reassures the parents that their son is experiencing a normal stress reaction. At the end of the visit, the patient's mother asks if she could talk to the physician in private. When left alone with the physician, the mother says: “I think my son is lying about the drug use. Could you please run a drug test on him but tell him it is just a routine laboratory test?” Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

Lying to a patient will likely damage the physician-patient relationship and possibly impede future care. Moreover, parental consent for medical care of an unemancipated minor is not required in matters of sex (e.g., contraception, pregnancy care except for abortion in most states, STIs) or addiction care; in these instances, minors can receive care without their parent's knowledge or consent. This patient's physical and mental examinations provide no evidence of compromised decision-making capacity, indicating that he is able to provide informed consent for his own medical care. In the case presented here, the physician should acknowledge the mother's concerns, investigate the underlying reasons for her request by asking open-ended questions, and explain the limitations of drug testing (e.g., false positives, false negatives). If the physician concludes that a drug screening test is appropriate, the next step would be to meet privately with the patient and seek his consent. Minors should also be encouraged to discuss their issues with their parents.",

        "content": "Penicillin V, 500 mg, orally, twice a day, for 10 days",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This prescription is written in precise, simple, and common language and is, therefore, least likely to result in a medication error. First, the drug is named specifically (“Penicillin V”). Second, the dosage (“500 mg”) describes the drug strength in clearly defined units and does not contain trailing zeros. Third, the route (“orally”), frequency (“twice a day”), and duration (“for 10 days”) of administration are all written in plain English; Latin, abbreviations, and acronyms should be avoided because they can be misinterpreted.\n\nIn addition, it is recommended to indicate the reason for the medication on the prescription (e.g., “Streptococcal pharyngitis”), as this introduces an additional safety checkpoint and opportunity for counseling for pharmacists and collaborating providers, and reminds the patient of the drug's purpose. Other instructions typically provided on prescriptions include the number of medication units to be dispensed and the number of refills permitted before the patient's next follow-up.",

        "explanation_why": "In general, it is recommended to use generic (e.g., “Penicillin V”) rather than commercial drug names (e.g., “Pen-V”) on prescriptions to avoid conflicts of interest and decrease the risk of confusing similar-sounding medications. Furthermore, the use of vague statements such as “as directed” should be avoided. The use of trailing zeros as in “500.00 mg” should be avoided because the dosage can be easily misread (e.g., 50000 mg), which can result in serious adverse events.",

Chest x-ray shows a patchy infiltrate in the left lower lobe and ipsilateral hilar enlargement. Microscopic examination of the sputum reveals acid-fast bacilli. Polymerase chain reaction confirms the diagnosis of respiratory tuberculosis and the patient is placed in an airborne infection isolation room. A nurse and a medical student enter the patient's room to insert a urinary catheter. While preparing to insert the catheter, the student notices that the nurse has put on nonsterile gloves.

        "explanation_why": "Whenever a person witnesses a medical error, they should directly inform the health care provider who committed the error. This should be done politely and without regard for workplace hierarchy, interpersonal relationships, or the potential of a career setback. A witness who fails to act is also culpable for the consequences of the error. Early medical error reporting can offer a chance for rectification (e.g., replacing nonsterile gloves with sterile gloves) and prevent a near miss (e.g., break of sterile technique) from becoming an adverse event (e.g., catheter-associated urinary tract infection). Patient safety (nonmaleficence) is the foremost priority; a safety culture fosters the reporting of both active errors (as seen here) and latent errors.",

        "explanation_why": "It is necessary to report of medical errors (e.g., through an incident reporting system), and doing so is in line with good safety culture. However, reporting the error to the head nurse at this step in the procedure delays the possibility of rectifying the error and increases the risk that a near miss (e.g., break in sterile technique) becomes an adverse event (e.g., catheter-associated urinary tract infection). Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the person who committed the error to report it. It would be more appropriate for the student to give the nurse the chance to self report the error at a later time.",

He recently enlisted in the US Army and started military training 2 weeks ago, but was not able to continue because his vision became severely blurry. He ambulates with a walking cane and wears dark glasses. He has no personal history of serious illness. His father has hyperopia. The patient appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Inspection of the eyes shows no abnormalities. Fundoscopy findings are normal. Snellen eye chart examination shows a visual acuity of 20/200 on the right and 20/100 on the left. When the physician suddenly passes a hand in front of the patient's eyes, he starts blinking. When asked to close his eyes, extend his hands, and touch the tip of his nose with his index finger, the patient touches his eyebrow and chin instead of his nose. The remainder of the neurologic examination is unremarkable. When asked to perform an additional perimetry test, the patient says “I'm really tired at this point and would really like to go home. I would really appreciate it if you could verify that I cannot see and that I cannot continue the military training.” In addition to acknowledging the patient's concerns, which of the following is the most appropriate action from the physician?",

    "hint": "This patient's physical examination findings (abnormal finger-to-nose test indicating a cerebellar condition, eye blinking as a response to a sudden hand wave indicating intact visual pathway) do not correlate with his presenting symptom (blurry vision) and additional examination findings (poor visual acuity indicating defective visual pathway). In combination with his request for a letter excusing him from military training, this should raise concern for malingering.",

She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Her current medication includes metformin, enalapril, and aspirin. She has brought laboratory results from a screening examination performed 2 weeks ago prior to donating blood. Laboratory studies from the blood bank show a nonreactive HIV-1/2 combination immunoassay and a nonreactive HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. While reviewing the patient's chart, the physician notices that an HIV-1/2 combination immunoassay, which was performed at last year's office visit by a colleague, was reactive. During the consultation, the physician realizes that the patient is not aware of the results of the HIV test that was performed a year ago.

Most medical errors are caused by failures in health care systems, and incident reporting can contribute to the identification and improvement of systemic issues. If there is no longer a patient-physician relationship with the colleague, the clinician must comply with HIPAA regulations by initially obtaining the patient’s permission to contact the physician.\n\nAdditionally, the clinician should inform the patient of the previous test result and discuss its implications, ensuring transparency and prioritizing care.

Pulmonary TB is often accompanied by tuberculous pleurisy, which manifests with chest pain and pleural effusion, as seen in this patient. The patient's chest x-ray findings are consistent with primary tuberculosis, which commonly affects the middle and lower pulmonary lobes. In contrast to primary TB, reactivation TB most commonly affects the upper pulmonary lobes and manifests with multiple cavitary lesions with calcifications and consolidations.\n\nIn patients with HIV, reactivated pulmonary TB can also manifest in the lower lobes.

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes.

Patients with suspected or confirmed active TB must be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) because droplet nuclei can remain suspended in the air and travel long distances. The negative air pressure in AIIRs prevents contaminated air from escaping. Furthermore, patients with active TB must wear surgical face masks in an ambulatory care setting or while being transported to another facility. Health care personnel should wear an N95 respirator (or a higher-level respirator) before entering the AIIR. Airborne precautions for active TB are usually terminated only after the patient has significant clinical improvement, three consecutive negative smears on sputum microscopy (collected 8–24 hours apart), a negative sputum culture, and received treatment for 2–3 weeks.\n\nOther infections requiring airborne precautions include measles, varicella, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections (e.g., COVID-19).",

There is a heterogeneous pattern of lung attenuation (mosaic attenuation), with areas of low attenuation (examples indicated by green overlays) in some regions with no fibrosis; expiratory phase imaging could help assess whether or not such areas represent air trapping.Fibrotic HP has a variable appearance on CT. A pattern typical of fibrotic HP shows a random axial distribution of coarse reticulation and small airway disease with minimal honeycombing and no zonal predominance. Subpleural fibrosis can be compatible with HP, as can upper zonal, lower zonal, or central predominant distributions.",

Therefore, it is crucial to carefully select appropriate candidates. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) considers fetal malpresentation (e.g., breech presentation), multiple gestations, and previous cesarean deliveries to be absolute contraindications for planned home births. This statement by the physician points out the dangers of home delivery given the patient's risk factors and clearly states that it is not advisable in this situation.\n\nWhen there is only one appropriate course of action, as seen here, and the patient does not agree, physicians should apply the principle of directive counseling, meaning that they should take an active role in the decision-making process by offering guidance and recommendations based on their expert clinical judgment. If multiple management options exist, each with its own benefits and risks, the principle of shared decision-making should be employed.",

Over the past year, he has been treated twice for food poisoning. He takes no medications. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 56 kg (115 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m^2. He appears tired and is oriented only to person. His temperature is 36.3°C (97.3°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/63 mm Hg. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and dry skin and mucous membranes; capillary refill time is 2 seconds. There is a tender, nonblanching, erythematous area over the patient's sacrum with superficial skin loss. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation and increased bowel sounds. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. Neurologic examination shows ankle clonus and an ataxic gait. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 9/30. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.0 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 116 μm^3, and leukocyte count is 13,800/mm^3 (14% eosinophils). Microscopic evaluation of the stool shows multiple eggs of Diphyllobothrium latum. The patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment and further evaluation.

In the US, physicians are legally and ethically obligated to report suspected older adult abuse to Adult Protective Services if the patient lives at home or with a relative or to the Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs if the abuse occurred in an institution (e.g., assisted living facility). Apart from investigating complaints, these agencies protect older adults by providing them with social, medical, and legal aid.",

    "hint": "The onset of fever and hemodynamic instability ≥ 48 hours after the insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC) and the growth of the same organism on blood cultures from the CVC and a peripheral vein with a differential time to positivity ≥ 120 minutes indicate a central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), even if the CVC's exit site does not show evidence of infection (e.g., tenderness, purulence).

        "explanation_why": "Maintenance of negative ambient air pressure is an example of an airborne precaution, which is effective in preventing in-hospital airborne transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, or varicella. P. aeruginosa is spread via contact transmission; standard precautions and contact precautions are effective in preventing nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections but airborne precautions are not. Moreover, in intensive care units, especially ones caring for immunosuppressed patients, a protective environment with a positive rather than negative ambient air pressure is usually maintained (neutropenic precautions).",

        "content": "Implementation of real-time feedback loops for hand hygiene compliance",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The most common mechanism for CLABSI is microbial spread (via surface motility and/or biofilm formation) to the CVC exit site from the patient's skin and/or the CVC hub. The hands of health care providers (HCPs) are often colonized by pathogens, resulting in HCPs cross-contaminating patients, other HCPs, and inanimate objects (leading to contact transmission), thereby facilitating nosocomial infections. Strict adherence to hand hygiene measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial infections such as CLABSI. Despite high numbers of hand hygiene stations and visual reminders at hospitals, the level of hand hygiene compliance among HCPs remains low because of lapses (due to work overload), poor situational awareness, and/or intolerance or aversion to certain disinfectants. An effective measure to increase compliance is a real-time feedback loop, in which hand hygiene observers or electronic hand hygiene systems monitor compliance and provide immediate feedback (e.g., verbal feedback on improper technique, data visualization of each hospital floor's hand hygiene process measures). Additional steps to increase hand hygiene compliance include staff training and providing alcohol-based foam rubs (which are quicker to use, more effective, and no more irritating to the skin than soap and water) at hand hygiene stations.\n\nCLABSI bundles (a collection of measures to prevent CLABSI) include proper site identification and technique for CVC insertion (e.g., avoiding the femoral region whenever possible), standardized checklists, and aseptic precautions (e.g., sterile glove use, disinfection with chlorhexidine) for CVC insertion as well as CVC site care, CVC removal as soon as possible, and champions-led rounding. These measures are important adjuncts but not substitutes for hand hygiene.",

Moreover, femoral CVCs are more likely to result in CLABSIs with gram-negative bacilli and Candida because the groin area has high levels of colonization by these microbes (due to factors such as moisture in intertriginous areas and proximity to the anogenital region) and is harder to keep clean. Femoral CVCs should be avoided.",

However, antibiotics are ineffective in the primary prevention of CLABSI and do not have a role before or during CVC insertion (e.g., through the introducer needle).

He rates his pain as an 8 on a 10 point scale. For the past 2 years, the patient failed to respond to multiple chemotherapy cycles. He was previously independent but now lives with his son and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. His son says that his father's condition “is deteriorating every day” and that he “cannot cope with the stress of taking care of him anymore.” The patient has had progressive loss of mobility and worsening pain for the past 6 months. During this time, he also has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and a 15-kg (33-lb) weight loss. He spends most of the day in bed and cannot tolerate walking without aid. Current medications include acetaminophen, oxycodone, and a fentanyl patch. He appears pale and malnourished. He is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination shows marked tenderness along the spine. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows multiple well-demarcated lesions in both lungs and in several vertebrae. The patient has no living will and says he wants to \"die in peace.\" The physician, son, and the rest of the patient's family agree to start hospice care. Which of the following is the most significant factor that affects eligibility for hospice care in this patient?",

The physician in question has been known for his unorthodox teaching methods. His colleagues describe him as misanthropic and eccentric, but a brilliant diagnostician of rare diseases. One year ago, he had a vascular infarction of his right quadriceps femoris muscle while playing golf, and ever since has a limp and uses a cane to walk. He is recently divorced and does not have any children. Over the past 3 months, the resident has observed the physician secretly taking pills on several occasions. During this period, he has also stopped attending rounds and charting. He often meets his patients at odd hours and has a tendency to be absent for a prolonged duration without telling anyone of his whereabouts or answering his phone, which has led to numerous complaints by his colleagues. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the resident?",

The PHP is supervised by the state medical board and aims to prevent, detect, and manage disorders that cause impairment in physicians. After the PHP receives a report, which can be submitted anonymously, a thorough assessment is performed. If physician impairment is confirmed, management options are offered; the PHP is not obliged to notify the state medical board about the physician's condition if they voluntarily accept treatment. However, if the physician refuses treatment, the PHP will report the physician's condition to the state medical board, which may lead to an involuntary referral for treatment and disciplinary actions. After treatment, the PHP monitors the physician with regular assessments and/or laboratory tests for 1–5 years depending on the underlying condition.",

Health care professionals reported to the state medical board may face disciplinary measures and/or have their medical license suspended/revoked.

She does not speak English and asks her bilingual adult daughter to translate. Her hemoglobin A_1C is 9.1%. A physician notices that the average hemoglobin A_1C of patients with diabetes mellitus and limited English proficiency in the hospital is significantly higher when compared to patients proficient in English. The hospital conducts an inpatient study, which finds a statistically significant correlation between scores on a standardized verbal English proficiency test and scores on standardized medication adherence scales and patient-physician concordance scales. Based on the results of a subsequent root cause analysis, the hospital management renegotiates health care payment contracts with their insurance provider to allow for reimbursement of professional medical interpreter services. This intervention best addresses which of the following barriers to high-quality health care?",

The use of professional medical interpreter services helps patients with LEP to receive information from health care providers in their native language but it does not address health illiteracy per se since the translated information can still be complex.

A code is called and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is initiated. Despite several cycles of CPR, the patient dies. A medicolegal autopsy reveals a massive pulmonary embolism and hemorrhage within the pons, thalami, and putamen. A subsequent investigation reveals that, during CPR, a health care provider in the code team administered boluses from a prefilled syringe containing 1:1000 epinephrine, which is used for intramuscular injections in the case of anaphylaxis, instead of the 1:10,000 preparation, which is used for intravenous boluses in the case of cardiac arrest. Which of the following actions at the hospital is most likely to prevent repeat incidents of this medication error?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "In this scenario, the medication error occurred at the stage of administration; the patient received the wrong dose via the intravenous route and subsequently suffered a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The action hierarchy of human factors engineering (HFE) categorizes actions aimed at preventing medical errors into stronger, intermediate, and weaker actions, depending on how much they rely on human effort.",

        "explanation_why": "This action is an example of a forcing function, which is considered a stronger action according to the action hierarchy of HFE. The storage of 1:1000 preparations of epinephrine (only used in anaphylaxis and for intramuscular injection) in epinephrine autoinjectors guarantees the correct route of administration of this highly concentrated epinephrine preparation. This forcing function would have prevented the medication error that resulted in a lethal complication in this scenario (i.e., a never event) by making it impossible to administer this epinephrine preparation via the intravascular route.\n\nOther examples of forcing functions include design features that only allow one health care record to be open on a computerized physician order entry system to prevent wrong-patient errors and providing different hub fits for intravenous injections of high-risk medications (e.g., opiates) to prevent administration of the wrong drug.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This physician has committed an active error (sharp end error) by ordering the drug for the wrong patient. Active errors (sharp end errors) occur at the level of contact between the healthcare provider and aspects of the health care system (e.g., patient, health records), are generally readily apparent, and usually have an immediate impact. Skills-based errors such as a slip (which occurred in this scenario) and a lapse are the most common types of active errors. This class of active errors can be prevented by implementing standardized protocols (e.g., implementing a SAFER checklist), organizational changes that minimize stress and fatigue (e.g., having float staff), and implementing forcing functions that minimize distractions (e.g., computerized provider order entry systems that allow only one electronic health record to be open at a time and medication orders to be entered only in a designated distraction-free zone). Such measures would simultaneously address the underlying latent errors that predispose to active errors.\n\nOther terms that are applicable to describe the physician's action in this scenario are medication error (specifically at the stages of ordering and transcribing), patient identification error, near miss, medical negligence, and a nonreviewable sentinel event. A near miss is an error that exposes the patient to potential harm but does not do so because of either a timely intervention (e.g., the nurse identifies that a doctor's order is for the wrong patient) or luck (as in this case, in which the patient did not experience any adverse effect from ketorolac). Any intervention on a wrong patient is a sentinel event, which necessitates a root cause analysis.\n\nSee \"Overview of medical error types\" table.",

He appears well and has no history of serious illness.

He discloses the error to the patient and reports the error to the hospital's event reporting system. Since the hospital was opened 1 year ago, the hospital management has received several reports of physicians inadvertently overlooking important clinical information in patient records, clinical deterioration of admitted patients following missed changes in vital signs, laboratory test results being issued for wrong patients, and patients accidentally receiving incorrect drug doses.

        "explanation_why": "Documentation errors caused by copying and pasting information in electronic health records (EHRs) are the most likely common source of the medical errors described here. EHRs, which were increasingly adopted following the HITECH Act of 2009, have several advantages (e.g., transparency, high fidelity) but also create the possibility for certain errors. The copy/paste function may result in the entry of incorrect or outdated information or the entry of information into the wrong patient's EHR, and subsequently lead to errors such as incorrect drug dosing, performing tests or treatment on the wrong patient, and billing for services that were never performed. Duplicating information also promotes “note bloat,” the proliferation of lengthy notes that include redundant, nonessential information, which may lead to physicians overlooking important facts. The unchecked transfer of outdated patient data, such as previous vital signs, can lead to the deterioration of patients due to missed changes in their condition.\n\nForcing functions on workstations such as allowing only one EHR to be open at a time, clipboard clearing, and disabling copy/paste functionality in certain parts of the EHR can prevent these errors. Other measures to improve safety with EHR use include the implementation of standardized protocols (e.g., SAFER guide) and personnel training.",

Duplex ultrasonography and CT angiography of the carotid arteries had shown an 80% stenosis on the right and 50% stenosis on the left. A shared decision to perform right-sided carotid endarterectomy was made with consent from the patient's medical power of attorney, and the management plan was documented in the patient records as “CEA right.” The surgical intern meets the patient on the ward on the day of surgery and, using a permanent marker, circles the surgical site and marks “X” on the nonsurgical site. The patient is brought to the operating room and the circulating nurse confirms that all relevant patient documents and findings are available. While the surgical team is scrubbing, the anesthetist asks the patient to verify her surgery site by pointing to it. Regional anesthesia is performed, and the patient is draped. The surgery is subsequently performed without any complications. While filling out the signout checklist after the surgery, the circulating nurse notices that the surgery was performed on the left carotid artery instead of the right. Which of the following actions would most likely have prevented this never event?",

    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "The Universal Protocol should be followed to prevent never events such as wrong-site surgery. This protocol consists of a series of steps based on the human factors engineering strategy of redundancy and standardization and should be performed before invasive medical procedures. In this scenario, the surgeon did not follow the protocol for one of these steps correctly and a subsequent step was missed entirely. If this subsequent step had been performed, it could have reduced the likelihood of the error occurring by acting as an additional safety measure (i.e., a Swiss cheese model).",

Marking may be performed by the attending surgeon after verbal confirmation from the patient, although it is acceptable to delegate to another person who will also be present during the procedure (e.g., the surgical intern in this scenario), or by the patient directly in front of the surgeon, but the site marking protocol should be standardized for each institution.",

        "explanation_why": "The Universal Protocol is a three-step process:\n\n1. preprocedural verification of the patient's identity, the surgical site, and the surgical procedure;\n2. surgical site marking;\n3. performing a time-out.\n\nA surgical time-out is performed in the operating room prior to the procedure to reconfirm the patient's identity, the procedure, and the surgical site. The time-out is typically initiated by a designated member of the team, such as the circulating nurse, and involves all of the team members (e.g., operating room technicians, principal surgeon, medical students) who are participating in the procedure. The whole team is responsible for reviewing all of the relevant information through active communication, and once everyone is in agreement, the time-out should be documented. A successful time-out requires a safety culture, which provides an environment in which health care providers can actively speak up about potential errors.\n\nThe protocol for surgical site marking was also not followed correctly in this scenario. When marking the surgical site, the correct site should be marked by writing the word “YES”, the surgeon's initials, or both using an indelible marker. The incorrect surgical site should not be marked; this includes marking with the word “NO” or an ambiguous visual cue (e.g., an “X” could also be interpreted as an indicator of the correct site).",

Therefore, adhesive tape is not recommended because it can easily be rubbed off or transferred to a different site, which can result in wrong-site surgery.",

    "question_text": "The event reporting system of a hospital logs three incidents of electrothermal injury to patients during surgical procedures over a 1-week period. The surgical team notices that these adverse events began shortly after the introduction of new electrocautery devices in the operating rooms. The new devices are a different brand than the ones used previously and were procured by the hospital management using a transparent tendering process as a replacement for some of the old electrocautery devices that had started to malfunction. The staff have been using electrocautery devices for a long time and did not report any incidents of electrothermal injuries with the old brand of electrocautery devices. A root cause analysis reveals that adverse events primarily occurred because the alarms of the new devices were too loud and distracting, and the surgical staff would occasionally turn down the alarm volume. Implementation of which of the following measures before introducing the new electrocautery device in the operating rooms would most likely have prevented the electrothermal injuries?",

The elimination of distraction is considered an “intermediate-level action” in preventing medical errors according to the action hierarchy of HFE. However, general noise reduction would not have prevented the adverse effects in this case, since the alarm signals of the electrocautery device could still have been turned down even if the general noise level was already decreased.",

New devices can be evaluated based on whether they meet the users' requirements (design validation) regarding the intended purpose and usability. In the action hierarchy of HFE, this method of error prevention is considered a “stronger action,” meaning that it is more effective in preventing medical errors since it does not rely on human effort for error mitigation compared to “weaker actions” such as training, double checks, warnings, and the introduction of new policies (e.g., checking the alarm volume hourly). Another example of a “stronger action” is the implementation of a forcing function, e.g., a design feature that switches off the electrocautery device if the volume falls below a certain level.",

    "question_text": "The chief medical officer of a health maintenance organization (HMO) receives reports from numerous healthcare providers at her organization that an increasing number of patients presenting with lower back pain receive CT and MRI scans unnecessarily and subsequently undergo follow-up workup for incidental findings. She observes that these referrals for imaging and the subsequent follow-up take up a large amount of the HMO's annual budget, which is primarily financed by a capitation reimbursement model. With the aim of decreasing the number of imaging referrals, she decides to purchase a validated computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) that uses evidence-based clinical decision rules to assist physicians in determining whether a patient with low back pain requires imaging. A failure mode and effects analysis is conducted for the CDSS and anticipated barriers to using the CDSS are addressed. According to the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) paradigm, which of the following is the most appropriate subsequent action?",

A failure mode and effects analysis is conducted for the CDSS and anticipated barriers to using the CDSS are addressed. According to the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) paradigm, which of the following is the most appropriate subsequent action?",

        "explanation_why": "It is not necessary to obtain informed consent before implementing the “Plan” phase of a PDSA cycle so long as the proposed plan does not deviate from the accepted standard of care. Avoiding unnecessary imaging and workup and the use of evidence-based clinical decision rules to assist in risk assessment are part of the standard of care. Physicians need to obtain informed consent before performing diagnostic procedures but do not need to obtain informed consent in order to use a validated CDSS as a decision-making guide.",

A backup plan should not be prepared or implemented prematurely because doing so can lead to wasteful resource utilization and increase the risk of unnecessarily abandoning the first plan. In this scenario, the effect of the CDSS should be measured and analyzed before preparing a backup plan.",

        "explanation_why": "The PDSA cycle is a model for rapid and continuous QI. In this scenario, the \"Plan\" phase has been completed, so the most appropriate next step is the \"Do\" phase, i.e., implementing the CDSS for a specified time frame and collecting both qualitative data (e.g., observations from frontline workers on unanticipated problems) and quantitative data (e.g., number of imaging referrals). In the first PDSA cycle, the plan is often implemented on a small scale to ensure the intervention is appropriately tested (e.g., implementing the CDSS with a cohort of physicians before implementing it throughout the HMO). At the end of the specified time frame, the “Study” phase begins. The collected data is analyzed using run charts and control charts to see if the plan had the expected effect on the QI measure, and conclusions are made. In the “Act” phase, changes to the plan are proposed if the desired effect was not achieved or unanticipated problems occurred. If the plan achieved the desired effect, preparations are made for implementation on a larger scale. The cycle is then repeated. If needed, multiple PDSA cycles (PDSA ramps), each of which tests a different plan, can be run in parallel. For a new or significantly altered plan, prospective QI tools (e.g., failure modes and effects analysis) can be used before implementing the plan.\n\nThe precursor of the PDSA cycle is the PDCA model, which is still preferred in some settings and primarily focuses on testing currently running processes to ensure compliance and/or reliability. The letter \"C\" refers to the \"Check\" phase, in which the intervention is evaluated and expected results and actual results are compared to see whether the process is going as planned.",

At a visit 3 weeks ago, the patient reported severe weight loss and loss of appetite. The physician recommended palliative percutaneous gastrostomy and explained the procedure as well as its benefits and possible complications. At the time, the patient objected to the procedure, stating that he did not wish to undergo any surgical procedures or life-prolonging interventions, including resuscitation. He designated his brother as the medical power of attorney. Current medications include quetiapine, hydromorphone-acetaminophen, and prednisolone. The patient appears cachectic and ill. He is 176 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 51 kg (112 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m^2. He is alert and fully oriented. His vital signs are within normal limits. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. He has a flat affect. He denies auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations. At the current visit, the patient appears to have changed his mind and wishes to undergo the procedure. His brother is present during the consultation and strongly disagrees with the patient's choice. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",

However, asking grieving family members to identify a deceased patient should be avoided (e.g., by using the hospital identification tag instead). Moreover, this response conceals the purpose of the physician's visit (i.e., pronouncing death) and is, therefore, inappropriate. Even if the deceased patient's family members have not yet been informed of the death, the physician should always address them in a clear, empathic manner and avoid euphemisms (e.g., “finalize his medical records”).",

        "explanation_why": "This statement is the most appropriate way to address the family members of a deceased patient after an expected death. After a self-introduction, the physician should offer condolences with simple empathic statements (e.g., “I am sorry for your loss,” “This is a difficult time”) and clearly state the purpose of the visit. The physician should then invite the family to remain in the room and ask questions. If available, psychological and spiritual support services (e.g., grief counseling, chaplains) should be offered to the family. Subsequently, the death pronouncement process is begun and consists of confirming the patient's identity, examining for responses to tactile stimuli, looking for fixed and dilated pupils, and checking for at least one minute for the absence of each of the following: carotid pulses, chest movement, heart and breath sounds, and recordable blood pressure. The time at which the examination is concluded is the time at which death is confirmed (stated as the time of death). During this examination, the physician should refrain from talking too much in order to allow the family to grieve.\n\nIf the patient does not have an advance directive regarding organ or body donation and a forensic autopsy is not indicated, the family should be asked if they wish to have a clinical autopsy. If the family does not wish to have one, the physician can seek permission for organ or body donation if applicable. If a forensic autopsy is indicated, the local death investigation office (e.g., coroner) should be informed, even if the family does not consent. Following the declaration of death, the physician who pronounced the death should enter a death note in the patient's records; further death documentation should be performed by the physician(s) who were responsible for the patient's care.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "Through the new policy, which allows all ED physicians to independently activate the cath lab based on a determined set of rules without the need for a consult, the hospital has replaced a forcing function, a human factors engineering strategy (HFE strategy), with a combination of three other HFE strategies: standardization, training, and cognitive aid.

        "explanation_why": "Door-to-balloon-time (D2B time) is a process measure. Standardization increases the reliability of a process and thereby decreases the magnitude of dispersion of process measures (e.g., variance of D2B time) as well as outcome measures (e.g., variance of case fatality rate). The new policy furthermore implies removal of a forcing function and introduction of training and cognitive aids, which decrease the process measure's central tendency (e.g., mean D2B time) and thereby the magnitude of the outcome measure's central tendency (e.g., mean case fatality rate of ACS).\n\nThis scenario also highlights the importance of a systems-based approach to quality improvement (QI) and the need for process validation when implementing a QI strategy in one aspect of a system, e.g., through change impact analysis, failure mode and effects analysis, or checking balancing measures. The forcing function was implemented in the ED at the request of the cardiology department before considering the effect of staffing shortfalls in the ED. It was not considered that a forcing function can prevent the timely performance of a critical step (e.g., cath lab activation) and can cause the entire process (e.g., chain of survival) to fail.",

    "hint": "This hospital wants to implement a payment model for its daycare surgery patients in which the health care organization is reimbursed for each service provided (e.g., each consultation, laboratory study, imaging study). Such a model is called a fee-for-service (FFS) payment model.",

        "explanation_why": "In the FFS model, the hospital is reimbursed for each service provided, regardless of performance and/or outcome. A decrease in the number of preventable adverse events would not be the most likely effect of the implementation of an FFS system because such a model does not provide any incentives for decreasing error rates. On the contrary, hospitals with the FFS model tend not to implement services that improve quality of care if they do not directly generate income (e.g., training staff) and are reimbursed for each subsequent service made necessary by an error.",

        "explanation_why": "The FFS model provides reimbursements for each unbundled health care service provided, rewarding activity rather than efficient use of resources. This can lead to overutilization of health care services, as evidenced, for example, by an increase in the number of elective surgeries. Furthermore, the FFS model does not reward performance, good outcomes, and/or coordination of services. Together, these effects lead to healthcare fragmentation and increased health care expenditures. Nevertheless, the FFS model is the dominant payment model in the US. Advantages of this model include price transparency, large revenues, and a decrease in administrative overhead expenditure.\n\nAlternatives to the FFS model include the capitation model, the bundled payment model, and the pay-for-performance model. All of these models aim to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional FFS model (e.g., inefficient utilization of resources) but are not without their own disadvantages (e.g., increased overhead expenditure with the pay-for-performance model).",

Reimbursement for each individual service regardless of the previous results obtained by other providers tends to foster duplication, lack of coordination, and lack of accountability. This would lead to an increase rather than a decrease in the use of diagnostic radiology services.",

He was born at term following a vaginal delivery at home. The mother states that, initially, the newborn fed well every 2–3 hours but developed poor feeding and irritability over the past 24 hours. The mother received no prenatal care during her pregnancy. The newborn appears lethargic. He is at the 35^th percentile for length, weight, and head circumference. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and widespread jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. His serum unconjugated bilirubin concentration is 31.5 mg/dL. The physician explains to the parents that the newborn must receive an exchange transfusion and phototherapy. The parents refuse to consent to the treatment and request immediate discharge, stating that they want to try \"natural” treatment options such as ginger tea and sunbathing. Despite counseling about the consequences of not treating the child, the parents do not change their decision. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?",

Since severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia has a very high risk of permanent brain damage and death, it is a life-threatening medical emergency and immediate therapy is necessary. If the medical condition threatens the child's life or limb and the effective treatment can be delayed for a short while (e.g., early-stage cancer), a court order should be obtained if parents refuse the treatment, assuming all other measures to convince the parents have failed. Parental refusal to consent to therapy is legally permitted when there is no risk of serious harm to the minor (e.g., for most vaccination refusals) or when the minor has a terminal condition that does not have any effective treatment (e.g., advanced metastatic cancer, certain high-grade brain tumors).",

    "question_text": "A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance 30 minutes after having fallen from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. Emergency medical technicians arrived at the scene of injury 10 minutes after the fall and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) en route to the hospital. On arrival, he is unconscious and has a Glasgow coma score of 3. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F) and he has nonpalpable pulses with asystole on ECG. CPR is continued and the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest auscultation discloses clear lung fields with bilateral air entry and absent heart sounds. Point of care ultrasound shows visible sliding of the pleura and no cardiac wall motion. There is no evidence of fluid in the pericardium, ventricular dilation, or inferior vena cava collapse. Arterial blood gas analysis on 100% oxygen shows a pH of 7.36 and an oxygen saturation of 99%. Despite continuing CPR for another 20 minutes, the ECG recordings persistently show asystole. The pupils are 9 mm and nonreactive to light. End-tidal carbon dioxide is 8 mm Hg (N = 35–45) and serum electrolyte concentrations are within normal limits. Two emergency medicine residents in their first postgraduate year ask the attending physician if they can practice femoral vein catheterization and scalpel cricothyroidotomy on the patient. There are no advance directives or emergency medical contacts in the patient's electronic health record. At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate instruction by the attending physician to the team treating the patient?",

    "hint": "In this patient, reversible causes of posttraumatic cardiac arrest (e.g., tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, exsanguination, asphyxiation) have been excluded. Before making a decision, the attending physician must consider the following scenario-specific features: high-energy trauma, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, late initiation of CPR, a cumulative CPR time > 30 minutes without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or a rhythm change at any point, end-tidal CO_2  < 10 mm Hg, and an examination finding suggestive of brainstem areflexia.",

Performing procedures on newly deceased patients can provide valuable hands-on training for inexperienced health care providers. However, consent from the next of kin is required for each procedure if the deceased's preferences are not known. According to the Uniform Anatomical Gifts Act, in the absence of an advance directive or emergency medical contacts in the patient's records, emergency physicians and medical technicians are allowed to search through the patient's belongings and may share their personal information (e.g., social security number) with authorities to identify them.\n\nIf the next of kin cannot be located within a reasonable time frame, it is ethically inappropriate to use the body of a deceased patient for training purposes, regardless of the degree of invasiveness of the procedure. If consent is obtained, the training procedures should be organized systematically and conducted under close supervision while ensuring a respectful environment for the deceased and their family.",

He was diagnosed with a left direct inguinal hernia 4 months ago and requested a day-care surgery because he does not wish to stay in the hospital longer than is necessary. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. The on-call anesthetist completed his preoperative assessment on the day of admission and cleared the patient for surgery. On the day of the surgery, the anesthesiology resident, who is part of the team performing the procedure, reviews the patient's records, determines that the patient needs echocardiography, and informs the surgical resident responsible for the patient's care. The surgical resident believes that the patient does not require any further preoperative cardiac evaluation and that performing the evaluation would necessitate postponing the surgery to the next day. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the surgical resident to the request for preoperative echocardiography?",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The anesthetist and surgeon work in a team but they have different processes, priorities, and knowledge based on their training. These differences can lead to interpersonal disagreement/conflict. There are five common strategies for dealing with disagreement/conflict: forcing (competing), accommodating, avoiding, compromising, and collaborating. In health care, collaboration should be used whenever possible.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This response is an example of collaboration (conflict management strategy). The surgeon's genuine inquiry about the anesthetist's reasoning allows an open discussion about the necessity of preoperative echocardiography and potential alternative courses of action. In collaborative negotiations, the participants should explore each other's thought processes (appreciative inquiry) and aim to understand their own interests regarding the issue (self-reflection). The collaboration strategy, which aims to solve problems in everyone's best interest (including the patient's), helps to maintain a good relationship between the conflicting parties and promotes mutual understanding, respect, and trust. A downside of this approach is that it is time-consuming and requires more effort and commitment, which may be impractical in emergency situations.",

Forcing may be appropriate when a quick solution to a problem is essential (e.g., life-threatening situation) or when all other methods are exhausted. This strategy should not be the surgeon's initial approach to this conflict because it might provoke similarly competitive behavior in the anesthetist, which will require more energy from both parties.

Accommodating may be appropriate when an issue is less important to the accommodating party, when maintaining harmony is more important than achieving a personal goal, when one party accepts that their position is wrong, or when continuing the conflict is unlikely to lead to a positive outcome. Though accommodating can reduce conflict and stress, this strategy should not be the surgeon's initial approach because it creates a win/lose relationship and may lead to feelings of resentment by the “losing” party. Simply giving in may also put the surgical resident in a position in which they can be taken advantage of in the future.

Avoidance may be appropriate when there is no time to deal with a conflict, when others can handle the conflict better, when the issue is not worth the effort of an argument, and/or when the other party is exhibiting hostile behavior. Though avoidance allows the surgeon to deflect conflict and stress, this strategy should not be the initial approach because it will likely damage the relationship between the residents and may lead to future conflicts. Moreover, by simply passing on the conflict to the attending, the surgeon weakens themself and denies responsibility for the patient. Involving third parties is helpful if two parties are not able to solve conflicts among themselves. However, in such cases, it is appropriate to involve a neutral third party rather than a negotiator who stands on the same side as one of the conflicting parties.",

She has had several jobs over the past 10 years but is currently unemployed and has Medicaid insurance. There is no family history of serious illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The patient explains that she has seen several physicians in the past, but all of them refused to order the requested test for her. She says, “You seem wonderful, unlike my previous physicians. They were all incompetent. I even filed a lawsuit against one of them!” On exploring the patient's fear of cancer and the reasons for her inquiry, she reports that she saw an online direct-to-consumer advertisement about whole-body CT scans. The physician explains when whole-body CT scans are performed and why the test is not indicated in her case. The patient becomes agitated and insists that the physician order the test. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the patient's request?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This response firmly yet politely rejects the patient's request. When evaluating a patient's demand for nonindicated care, physicians need to balance the core ethical principles. The ethical principle of patient autonomy, according to which a physician only assists in making decisions corresponding to the patient's personal values, is overruled in favor of beneficence and nonmaleficence in this directive counseling approach. Since there is no evidence that the possible benefits of whole-body CT scanning of asymptomatic individuals (e.g., to relieve the fear of cancer) outweigh the potential harm (e.g., radiation exposure, potential detection of ill-defined abnormalities requiring follow-up testing and interventions), the physician is acting in the patient's best interest (beneficence) and preventing harm (nonmaleficence). Moreover, denying nonindicated investigations and interventions also helps to ensure more equitable care. Finally, it is important for the physician to emphasize that the test is currently not indicated; it might be indicated in the future.\n\nThe patient's behavior in this scenario resembles splitting, a psychological defense mechanism characteristic of borderline personality disorder. Splitting involves separating experiences or people into all-good and all-bad, such as this patient's negative description of her past physicians. To minimize the effects of splitting, health care providers should collaborate toward common management goals, communicate regularly, and clarify their roles in patient care.",

        "explanation_why": "While physicians should always inform patients of their right to seek an additional medical opinion, it is not appropriate to threaten to end the patient-physician relationship because the patient insists on having a nonindicated test. Also, sending the patient to another physician will not solve the problem. Denying the request for a nonindicated screening test is the correct action, which is why the physician should refrain from apologizing.

        "explanation_why": "A suspected violation of medical licensing provisions should always be reported to an appropriate authority. A health care provider (HCP) who witnesses such a violation but fails to report it can be held liable for concealment. Suspected incidents of misconduct or incompetence can be reported initially to an oversight authority within the organization (e.g., department chair, chief medical officer, peer review body) if the HCP under suspicion is within the oversight authority's purview. The incident should be reported to the state medical licensing board (SMLB) if the HCP under suspicion is outside the oversight authority's purview (as in this scenario), the incident continues despite initial reporting, or, for any reason, the incident cannot be reported to an oversight authority. Complaints to the SMLB can be filed by anyone (e.g., patients, HCPs, other SMLBs), and, in some states, anonymously. Following a complaint to the SMLB, the licensee against whom the complaint is made receives a formal notification and is asked to make a statement and provide information to clarify the situation. If required, the SMLB can initiate formal hearings and/or initiate disciplinary actions (board orders).\n\nIn the case of billing fraud, the appropriate investigatory authority of the insurance provider (e.g., CMS office in cases of Medicaid or Medicare fraud) should also be informed. If the alleged misconduct potentially violates any criminal statutes, law enforcement authorities should also be informed. When a violation of a medical licensing provision is suspected to be due to physician impairment, it is appropriate to first inform the local Physician Health Program (PHP), which is supervised by the SMLB and can make recommendations to the SMLB if required.",

Two months ago, she was diagnosed with cholelithiasis after recurrent episodes of biliary colic. Current medications include oral contraceptives and multivitamins. The physician obtains informed consent only for the cholecystectomy and the patient is brought to the operating room. After induction and anesthesia, the surgeon removes the gallbladder but also finds a 3-cm, ill-defined subcapsular mass in the right lobe of the liver. Results of a frozen section from the lesion are consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma, which will require additional surgery. The patient has no durable medical power of attorney. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

If an incidental finding during surgery does not require immediate action, performing an additional procedure without patient consent is unlawful. In this patient undergoing cholecystectomy, the surgeon incidentally discovers hepatocellular carcinoma that does not currently pose immediate life-threatening harm. Therefore, closing the patient, waking her up, and obtaining consent is the most appropriate next step. In situations in which there is a threat of immediate harm if the patient is not treated, the need for full informed consent is waived. If a patient lacks decision-making capacity (e.g., due to coma), consent for nonemergency procedures should be obtained from the patient's designated medical power of attorney or, if there is no such designated person, a next of kin.",

After receiving a standardized handoff in a designated distraction-free zone from the team covering the morning shift, the nurse covering the subsequent shift enters the patient's room with a workstation on wheels and the patient's medication dispensers. He introduces himself to the patient. The patient introduces herself with her surname and starts to converse with the nurse. During the conversation, the nurse notices that the patient's issued armband with a patient barcode and identification number is by the bedside on the nightstand.

Further appropriate patient identifiers include an assigned identification number (on an armband attached to the patient), telephone number, or other unique identifiers available in the patient's health record or established on admission. The specific two patient identifiers used for verification should ideally be standardized within a given setting (e.g., consistently using full name and date of birth on this patient's ward).",

        "explanation_why": "A root cause analysis (RCA) is a type of retrospective patient safety investigation. RCAs can be conducted following the near miss of a sentinel event (e.g., surgery on the wrong patient) and involve interviewing frontline workers (e.g., surgeons). Unlike the meeting described here, however, RCAs focus on identifying problems within systems and processes (blunt-end errors) rather than only individual actions (sharp-end errors) and involve discussions with interprofessional teams (i.e., all staff in the operating room including nurses, technicians, and anesthetists, not just surgeons). In addition, an RCA is a more thorough process than the one described in this scenario; it analyzes all events rather than select cases (if the RCA is conducted after multiple events) and is performed with the 5WH1 and 5 Whys technique and analysis tools (e.g., fishbone diagram) in order to determine the root cause of the problem.",

The first phase (“plan”) of the PDSA cycle consists of preparing a new process or tool (e.g., a patient safety training program for surgeons), identifying one or more quality improvement measures (QI measures) that reflect the performance of the new process or tool (e.g., an outcome measure such as the number of near miss events), and establishing a target for a change in the identified QI measure (e.g., a statistically significant decrease in the number of near misses). The implemented meetings described here may be used to assess the need for improvement in specific areas and prepare a plan but do not meet all of the criteria for the first phase of the PDSA cycle.",

        "explanation_why": "Morbidity and mortality reviews (M&Ms) are department meetings in which selected cases involving medical errors (including near misses and preventable or ameliorable adverse events) are confidentially presented, reviewed, and discussed among peers. The meetings should ideally follow a standardized format that includes analyzing medical errors and determining improvement measures to be followed up. M&Ms take place at regular intervals, typically monthly. The goal of an M&M is not to punish individuals but to identify measures for individual improvement and increase situational awareness as well as collective responsibility among team members. Since M&Ms are a type of peer review activity, the meeting's proceedings, findings, and recommendations (as well as any documentation) are legally protected and inadmissible in malpractice lawsuits.",

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes. Chest x-ray in reactivation TB typically shows multiple cavities in the upper lobes, calcifications, patchy consolidations, and features fibroproliferative disease (e.g, scarring) due to inflammatory tissue destruction.",

Today, he has had three episodes of foul-smelling, nonbloody diarrhea without nausea or vomiting. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, cefotaxime, and clarithromycin. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Crackles are heard over the right lower lung base. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. Leukocyte count is 13,000/mm^3. Stool analysis is pending. In addition to isolating the patient and wearing gloves and a gown upon room entry, which of the following infection control measures is most appropriate for preventing transmission of the organism responsible for this patient's gastrointestinal symptoms?",

In addition to isolating the patient and wearing gloves and a gown upon room entry, which of the following infection control measures is most appropriate for preventing transmission of the organism responsible for this patient's gastrointestinal symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Health care providers wear an N95 respirator as part of airborne precautions when caring for patients with diseases spread by person-to-person airborne transmission (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella). Prevention of C. difficile transmission does not require airborne precautions.\n\nLegionnaire disease (LD), which causes acute pneumonia and GI symptoms (e.g., watery diarrhea, abdominal pain), can spread in hospitals via airborne transmission as a result of aerosol generation from a contaminated water source (e.g., through an airconditioning unit or shower). However, patients with LD usually develop pneumonia and GI symptoms simultaneously, unlike this patient who developed GI symptoms 5 days after being admitted for pneumonia. Moreover, transmission-based precautions (e.g., airborne precautions) are not indicated when caring for patients with LD because person-to-person transmission of LD is extremely rare.",

        "explanation_why": "Adequate hand hygiene, which is a standard precaution, should always be performed by health care providers (HCPs) for infection control before and after contact with a patient, regardless of whether or not the patient has an infection. In most instances, the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) alone is a quicker and superior method of hand hygiene than washing hands with soap and water. However, hand hygiene with soap and water rather than an ABHR is required if the HCP's hands are visibly soiled or when caring for patients with acute infectious diarrhea or infections due to spore-forming organisms such as C. difficile, because ABHRs are ineffective against spores. Wearing gloves and a gown is an important adjunct in preventing contamination with spores but is not a substitute for hand hygiene. HCPs should wash hands with soap and water before putting on gloves and gowns as well as after removing them.\n\nWhen caring for patients with contact-transmitted diseases such as C. difficile infection, in addition to standard precautions, HCPs should follow contact precautions (e.g., isolating patients, wearing gloves and a gown upon room entry).",

The patient retained decision-making capacity at the time of diagnosis and a surgical resident obtained informed consent from the patient for the procedure. The on-call surgeon is 30 minutes late and the operating room staff is unable to reach her by telephone to confirm the instruments and materials she requires for the procedure. When she arrives, the scrub technician smells alcohol on the surgeon's breath and then confirms this suspicion with the nurse anesthetist present for the case. If the on-call surgeon performs the procedure in her current state, which of the following principles of patient care would most likely be violated?",

        "explanation_why": "Nonmaleficence is the medical ethical principle of avoiding patient injury or suffering (i.e., “do no harm”). Most decisions in patient care require weighing the principle of nonmaleficence against the principle of beneficence (i.e., acting in the patient's best interest). In this scenario, the patient has an indication for an emergency appendectomy, and surgical management is in his best interest (principle of beneficence). However, the patient is at risk of serious harm due to physician impairment, and this risk cannot be outweighed by the benefits of having the procedure done by an impaired physician. The operating room staff needs to prevent the surgeon from performing the appendectomy and find a substitute surgeon.\n\nIn addition, the Physician Health Program (PHP) should be informed about the incident. The PHP will perform a thorough assessment of the physician and arrange appropriate management and support if an impairment is confirmed. Note that the PHP is not obliged to notify the state medical board if the physician accepts treatment of the impairing condition.",

Eight months ago, he sustained a needlestick injury while providing local anesthesia for the incision and drainage of an abscess in a woman with unknown HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) status. He is vaccinated against HBV and had adequate titers of anti-HBs at the time of the injury. He was prescribed tenofovir, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir immediately after the injury but had to discontinue these medications after 1 week because of nausea and vomiting. The results of the previous HIV-1/2 combination immunoassay performed 4 months ago and the previous anti-HCV antibody titer test performed 2 months ago were negative. Vital signs are within normal limits and physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time?",

        "explanation_why": "After an NSI, the exposed individual should undergo a baseline antibody-based HIV test (preferably the HIV-1/2 combination immunoassay) and, if the source patient's HIV status is positive or unknown, follow-up testing at 6 weeks and 4 months (if using the HIV-1/2 combination immunoassay) or at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months (if using a previous generation antibody-based test). Extended follow-up testing for HIV (e.g., at 1 year after the NSI) is only required if the exposed individual becomes HCV-positive or has impaired humoral immunity because delayed HIV seroconversion can occur in these patients. The decision to initiate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) against HIV after NSI is made using a shared-decision making strategy based on a risk-benefit analysis (e.g., source patient status, drug toxicities).\n\nFollowing NSI, provided the source patient has a negative HCV status, no further testing for HCV is required in the exposed individual. If the source patient's HCV status is positive or unknown, the exposed individual should undergo a baseline anti-HCV antibody test and follow-up with an HCV nucleic acid amplification test at 3–6 weeks and an anti-HCV antibody test at 4–6 months. Currently, no PEP against HCV is recommended, but exposed individuals who become HCV-positive should receive direct-acting antiviral therapy.\n\nIf the source patient has a negative HBV status or if the exposed individual had adequate anti-HBs titers, no further testing or PEP against HBV is required. If the exposed individual had inadequate titers and the source patient's HBV status is positive or unknown, the exposed individual should receive PEP against HBV with active and passive immunization and undergo follow-up testing with anti-HBc and HBsAg at 6 months.",

A quantitative NAAT (e.g., real-time polymerase chain reaction), which can measure viral loads, is used to measure response to treatment in patients with confirmed HIV infection and to screen for HIV in children younger than 18 months born to mothers with HIV infection (antibodies can cross the placenta which can cause false positives). With the exception of congenital HIV infection, NAAT is not used as the initial test to diagnose HIV infection or for the follow-up of patients without a confirmed HIV infection because this test has a higher rate of false positives than antibody-based tests and undetectable HIV RNA does not rule out HIV transmission.",

        "explanation_why": "To ensure personal safety when dealing with an aggressive patient, the HCP should step two arm lengths away and position themselves closer to the exit (so that there is an escape route) without blocking the patient's view or access to the exit. The HCP should then attempt verbal deescalation. Offering comfort measures (e.g., food, water) is an appropriate initial step. During verbal deescalation, only one HCP should talk to the patient; the HCP should remain calm, maintain a neutral expression, respect the patient's personal space, and avoid gestures that can be perceived as threatening (e.g., sudden movement, staring back at the patient, expressing a condescending or commanding attitude). The HCP should acknowledge the patient's feelings, ask what the patient wants, and allow the patient to choose between different acceptable options (e.g., sitting down or lying down); doing so gives the patient a sense of control while also clarifying rules and limits (e.g., informing the patient that violent or abusive behavior will not be accepted). The HCP should listen actively, use short sentences and simple words, seek out points on which they and the patient can agree, and give the patient time to process information and respond.\n\nIf the patient continues to remain aggressive despite attempts at verbal deescalation, it is appropriate to ask the patient to voluntarily take a calming medication orally before considering use of force. The use of force (e.g., physical restraints, involuntary sedation) should only be considered if all other measures fail or if the patient is actively violent.

He reports feeling dizzy and nauseous and that he had to lie down again after trying to stand up to go to the bathroom. He says that his symptoms began 30 minutes after he was brought back to the ward from the radiology department, where he underwent a CT scan of the chest to evaluate an incidental pulmonary nodule found on chest x-ray. Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease and hypertension. After admission, bisoprolol therapy was temporarily discontinued and he was started on furosemide. His other medications are aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. The physician on call takes the patient’s vital signs and measures a pulse of 138/min and blood pressure of 95/70 mm Hg. Further investigation reveals that the changes in the patient's pulse and blood pressure were not detected despite continuous cardiac telemetry being a part of the patient's admission orders. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the error that occurred in this scenario?",

Failure at the level of the device-human interface (e.g., disconnection of the patient from or improper connection of the patient to the telemetry device) is the most common cause of inpatient cardiac telemetry-related errors (approx. 50% of cases) and typically occurs after patients are shifted (e.g., for a test). Less common causes of inpatient cardiac telemetry-related errors are equipment malfunction (25%), communication breakdown (20%), and alarm fatigue (5%). Cardiac telemetry-related errors rarely cause patients to be harmed, but when they do, the consequences are dire with death as the most frequent outcome. Measures that can be taken to prevent such errors include checklists and standardization for inpatient transfers, regular telemetry equipment checks, forcing functions that prevent alarms from being turned down, and redirection of low-level alarms to telemetry technicians to prevent alarm fatigue in nurses.",

Patients with decision-making capacity need to give informal permission for their PHI to be disclosed to bystanders, even if they are the patient's next of kin or friend. In order to protect patient confidentiality, the physician should employ a patient-centered approach and discuss the patient's individual preferences. By asking for the patient's permission for the bystanders to be present, the physician acknowledges the patient's autonomy, which can strengthen the patient-physician relationship.\n\nIf the patient gives permission for the bystanders to be present, physicians should try to determine the relationship between the patient and the bystanders and assess the reason for their presence during the visit. If necessary, physicians should also ensure that there is time for a private conversation during the visit.",

In this scenario, the physician immediately made a diagnosis (costochondritis) and failed to consider an alternative cause for the patient’s chest pain (myocardial infarction). The physician should have taken the patient’s risk factors for cardiovascular disease (i.e., older age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension) into account and performed further diagnostic testing. An electrocardiogram is indicated for patients > 35 years of age with suspected costochondritis. If the physician had been aware of his cognitive bias, myocardial infarction could have been diagnosed at the office, which may have improved the patient's outcome. Strategies to avoid cognitive biases include education on cognitive errors, diagnostic time-outs, differential diagnosis generators, and checklists.\n\nIn many situations, several cognitive errors can occur simultaneously. Omission bias, overconfidence, and availability bias may have also occurred in this scenario.",

A high CV indicates that values are widely spread around the mean. In a system with multiple processes, such as the various aspects of a patient's visit, the process with the highest CV should be optimized first to improve the system's overall reliability and efficiency. Optimization of vital parameter measurements, which has the highest CV (5 ÷ 8 = 0.62), will therefore most likely have the greatest impact on reducing the average time that patients spend in the practice.\n\nIn contrast, SD, which is an absolute measure of dispersion, describes the variability of data in relation to the mean within a single data set.",

    "question_text": "In a private conversation, physician A discloses to physician B that he sometimes leaves the hospital during working hours to go to the mall for personal errands. Physician A claims that he is “doing nothing wrong” as he only leaves when there are just a few patients in the ward.

The elements of malpractice (i.e., the 4 Ds) are the duty to properly treat the patient, dereliction of that duty, damage to the patient, and direct cause of damage through medical negligence. Although Physician A neglected the duty to treat his patients, none have been directly damaged. Therefore, he did not commit malpractice and a different term describes his actions.",

In this scenario, physician A leaves the hospital and puts patients at risk through his absence, which violates the principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence. This behavior is never acceptable regardless of whether it results in harm to a patient or incurs legal consequences. Misconduct can also occur outside the established physician-patient relationship and does not always constitute malpractice (e.g., research malfeasance, fraudulent advertising). Other examples of misconduct include bullying, making inappropriate comments and/or sexually harassing colleagues or patients, billing fraud, and receiving gifts from patients or pharmaceutical industry representatives. Colleagues who suspect a physician of misconduct should report their concerns to the state medical board, and, if the misconduct implies any legal liability, to the appropriate legal authorities.",

        "explanation_why": "During a handoff, the senders (the outgoing team) should prioritize communicating critical information, tasks (i.e., to-do items), and recommendations for anticipated events (i.e., if/then items) to the receivers (the incoming team). For example, “If the patient develops dyspnea, administer 40 mg of intravenous furosemide.” is an if/then item. Receivers should be able to ask questions and discuss uncertainties; therefore, handoffs should consist of verbal communication, preferably face-to-face, at a designated time and place free of nonemergency disturbances. Written communication (e.g., electronic health records, checklists, protocols) can be used as a complementary tool.\n\nStandardized handoff communication tools (e.g., IPASS, SBAR) ensure consistency in the exchange of relevant patient information among physicians.",

She has not been able to walk her dog for the past 6 months because of severe pain that worsens with movement; during the past couple of weeks, she has also had pain without movement at night. Medical history is remarkable for several knee injuries from playing soccer in college. Previous treatment with physical therapy, diclofenac, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections has not provided significant pain relief. She has no other history of serious illness. She is 164 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 74 kg (163 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m^2. Range of motion of the right knee is limited; there is palpable crepitus and moderate swelling. X-ray of the right knee joint shows marked osteophyte formation and irregular joint space narrowing. The surgeon wants to schedule the patient for total knee arthroplasty. She has a health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance plan, and the surgeon is an in-network provider. The patient is concerned about potential out-of-pocket costs for this treatment. Which of the following is the most appropriate administrative action by the orthopedic surgeon?",

        "content": "Defer knee surgery until a request for reimbursement is approved by the HMO",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Prior authorization (PA) is a process used by health insurance companies to evaluate the medical necessity and cost of medications, tests, and treatments in order to approve coverage before they are provided to the patient. Health insurance companies usually require PA for elective and expensive interventions that have lower-cost alternatives (e.g., arthroplasty). PA is obtained to ensure that the health insurance company will cover the requested care, protecting patients from financial liability. If a health care provider is in-network, they are responsible for determining whether an intervention needs PA and for submitting the request form to the health insurance company. Treatment should only be provided after the health insurance company has reviewed and approved the request.",
        "explanation_but": "Many health care providers have called for reforming of the PA process because of its detrimental impact on patient care. PAs are widely considered to be a time-consuming administrative burden that can result in delays in care and adverse clinical outcomes. Submitting requests electronically can help reduce administrative time and speed up the process of obtaining PA.",

    "question_text": "A 72-year-old man is referred to a radiology practice by his primary care physician for a CT scan because of a 2-month history of progressive dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years but quit 3 years ago. The CT scan shows a 3-cm nodule with irregular borders in the right upper lobe suggestive of malignancy. The radiologist who reviewed the CT scan writes the final report and uploads it to the patient's electronic health record. Because some of the front office staff in the primary care physician's practice had been out on sick leave, the patient's follow-up visit was rescheduled to 4 weeks later. When the physician finally discusses the results with the patient, the patient becomes angry and says, “I have been unable to sleep for the past month because I was so worried about the results, and now I will die because I didn't receive treatment in time.” Which of the following strategies would have been most effective in preventing the delay in further management?",

        "explanation_why": "Anhydrous ammonia is widely used as a fertilizer in agriculture. It is also used in manufacturing (e.g., for synthetic fibers and methamphetamines) and as a refrigerant. This pungent gas is typically stored in a compressed liquid state at temperatures well below the freezing point of water. Release to ambient pressure and temperature converts the liquid into an irritant gas. Ammonia reacts exothermically with water (e.g., in the mucous membranes) to form ammonium hydroxide, an alkaline solution. This causes thermal and caustic injury to the mucous membranes (e.g., eyes, oral cavity, respiratory tract) and other exposed areas, and results in symptoms such as throat irritation, cough, conjunctival irritation, lacrimation, and lip burns. Severe exposure may lead to airway obstruction and pulmonary edema. Exposure to anhydrous ammonia in its cold liquid state can cause frostbite. No specific antidote is available for ammonia poisoning, and an ABCDE approach to asphyxiant and irritant exposure is recommended.",

She has been recovering well. She can walk with the aid of a walker, has no speech impairment, and tolerates a regular diet. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Medications are metformin, lisinopril, simvastatin, and daily aspirin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Cranial nerves are intact. Muscle strength in the extremities is 5/5 on the left and 3/5 on the right. Sensation is intact bilaterally. Standardized assessment of cognitive function shows mild impairment. The patient says that she is tired of being in the hospital. She lives alone in a small apartment on the ground floor with no stairs. The patient's daughter agrees to take care of her mother but mentions that she cannot afford to take any more time off work. The daughter works part-time as a kindergarten teacher. Which of the following is the most appropriate action to ensure the patient's well-being?",

        "explanation_why": "The physician is responsible for assessing whether to involve a multidisciplinary team of discharge planners (usually social workers and/or nurses). Discharge planners can be especially helpful for patients who are at high risk for adverse events after discharge and require ongoing skilled care. Discharge planning should be initiated as early as possible and includes a psychosocial assessment, discharge counseling, medication reconciliation, planning of follow-up visits, and coordination of services. The patient, their family, and future caregivers should be involved to establish a plan that meets the patient's medical needs and personal preferences. Effective discharge planning can increase patient satisfaction, reduce the duration of hospitalization, and decrease readmission rates.\n\nHome health care should be considered for patients who live at home and require complex ongoing care but are unable to travel. This form of rehabilitation reduces costs while avoiding the risks associated with prolonged hospitalization (e.g., nosocomial infections).",

    "question_text": "A 66-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 2-day history of vomiting and abdominal pain that radiates to his back. Medical history is remarkable for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. His medication includes enalapril and tamsulosin. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ketorolac is initiated. One day after admission, the patient becomes restless and insists on leaving the hospital to “run some errands” against the advice of his treating physician. When a resident tries to talk to him, the patient suddenly approaches her and screams, “I need to leave now!” A nearby nurse who heard the screaming calls the rapid response team. The arriving psychiatrist slowly approaches the patient without blocking the exit, introduces herself, and calmly asks why he would like to leave the hospital. The patient begins to shout at the psychiatrist and pulls out his intravenous catheter. The psychiatrist asks the patient to sit down and have a glass of water. The patient does not respond and starts mumbling and banging his head against the wall. The psychiatrist says, “I would also like for you to leave this hospital when it is possible.” The patient abruptly turns and throws one of his slippers at the psychiatrist. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The goal of treatment is to relieve the patient's distress while permitting a safe medical and psychiatric evaluation. In uncooperative patients, parenteral administration is required. If necessary, an intramuscular medication can be used initially to calm the patient and facilitate safe intravenous access. Treatment should be based on the suspected cause and severity of symptoms (e.g., an antipsychotic with a short-acting benzodiazepine for severe agitation). If a patient is cooperative, they should be involved in choosing the medication and administration route (oral medication is preferred).\n\nPhysical restraint is sometimes necessary as a subsequent measure if calming medication and deescalation techniques have been unsuccessful and patients continue to be a danger to themselves or health care providers.",

His medical history is remarkable for hypertension and colorectal carcinoma, for which he underwent right-sided hemicolectomy 7 years ago. His medications are metoprolol and lisinopril. Physical examination shows a soft and reducible mass in the patient's right inguinal region and a well-healed midline scar. The patient is scheduled for an open hernioplasty on the next day. The attending surgeon who will perform the procedure expects no significant complications. A fourth-year medical student who is on rotation in the surgical ward asks if she may scrub in and participate as a second assistant in the procedure. She has sufficient experience in the operating room from previous clerkships. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the attending surgeon?",

        "explanation_why": "Third parties often make decisions that affect the patient's health and welfare and are vulnerable to a physician's influence. Initiating a personal relationship with a third party who is close to the patient (e.g., parent, spouse, partner) and plays an integral role in the patient's medical decision-making process is therefore inappropriate as it can compromise treatment (as well as autonomy and patient privacy in patients with decision-making capacity and legal competence). Such relationships can limit the physician's objectivity, exploit the trust of the third party, and negatively affect the patient's well-being, which is why the invitation should be declined.\n\nWhile romantic or sexual relationships between physicians and current patients are always unethical, physicians (excluding psychiatrists) may engage in romantic or sexual relationships with patients if more than 1–2 years have passed since termination of the patient-physician relationship. Psychiatrists are in a special position of influence over their patients and should never engage in such relationships with current or former patients.",

She is diagnosed with acute appendicitis and scheduled for a laparoscopic appendectomy the next day. She is given nothing by mouth, and administration of intravenous fluids is begun. On the night before the surgery, she experiences severe abdominal pain and asks for pain medication. The physician on call prescribes intravenous acetaminophen. A nurse connects the medication to the patient's infusion set, opens one side clamp, and leaves the room. One hour later, the patient is still in severe pain and calls the physician again. The physician discovers an additional closed side clamp that he had not noticed in his past five years at the hospital. He opens the clamp, and the infusion starts to run. When the physician discusses the incident with his colleagues, someone says, “We have two types of infusion sets in the hospital. This one is new.” The underlying cause of the delay in this patient's treatment is best described by which of the following terms?",

Latent errors often go unnoticed; in combination with active errors, they can cause adverse events. In this scenario, the lack of equipment standardization was a latent error, and the nurse's failure to open both side clamps was an active error that resulted in delayed treatment. Other examples of latent errors include the storage of medications with similar packaging alongside each other and ineffective organizational structure. Reporting systems (e.g., an incident reporting system) can help to identify latent errors, reduce the likelihood of adverse events, and improve the overall quality of patient care. The majority of adverse events are caused by latent errors rather than by individual incompetence.\n\nSee \"Overview of medical error types\" table.",

A ventilation system that creates positive pressure allows air to flow out and prevents contaminated air from entering the room. In order to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, however, contaminated air should be contained in the patient's room using airborne infection isolation rooms, which provide negative pressure and prevent contaminated air from flowing out.",

Wearing an N95 respirator when entering a patient's room is part of airborne precautions to prevent transmission. In addition to airborne and standard precautions, which include wearing complete personal protective equipment (i.e., gloves, gown, eye protection), droplet precautions should also be adopted.

Initially, the patient is reluctant to disclose the mechanism of injury but then admits that it occurred during penetrative sexual intercourse at a swinger party. He says that he heard a cracking sound, which was followed by intense pain and an immediate loss of erection. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hematoma and curving of the penis. He is diagnosed with a penile fracture and undergoes uncomplicated surgical repair. After surgery, the patient asks the physician if they could change the diagnosis in his medical records because he is ashamed that his colleagues may read them. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

Intentional falsification of medical records may constitute misconduct and lead to serious consequences for the physician, even if the medical care provided was appropriate. Therefore, the physician should reject the patient's request and reassure him that his records are treated confidentially.\n\nUnder HIPAA, patients can request changes to their medical records if they consider them incomplete or inaccurate by placing a formal request to the covered entity. The covered entity should correct the medical record if the information is incomplete or inadequate and when making changes, a strikethrough (i.e., a line drawn through the text) should be applied to written and/or electronic notes but still remain legible to avoid ambiguity.

        "explanation_why": "Drugs that are commonly required during surgery should be prepared beforehand and should always be readily available. Involving the on-site pharmacist is a key step to prevent drug dispensing errors. If multiple patients receive doses from the same vial (as seen in multidose vials), drug dispensing for the operating room should take place in a clean area reserved for medication preparation (e.g., a satellite pharmacy) and in an aseptic manner (e.g., using sterile syringes, disinfecting the septum before piercing the vial). Preparing drug trays with prefilled syringes in conjunction with clear labeling (e.g., with the drug's generic name and drug concentration) using standardized printed labels maximizes patient safety by reducing the risk of product mix-ups and dispensing errors. The label may also include the date, time, pharmacist's name, and the patient's name and date of birth.",

Therefore, there would be an increased risk of attentional capture and skill-based errors if the anesthesiologist was responsible for drawing up drugs during surgery.

    "question_text": "A 58-year-old man comes to the oncologist for a follow-up examination 6 months after he underwent uncomplicated operative resection of the right colon and adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer. Medical history is remarkable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a daily multivitamin. His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 128/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar on the right abdomen. Results of laboratory studies, including carcinoembryonic antigen levels, are within the reference ranges. The patient reports that he generally feels fine and asks if the blood tests he undergoes during monthly visits to his primary care physician (PCP) are necessary. While reviewing the patient's electronic health record (EHR), the physician notices that the PCP has been ordering monthly complete blood counts and serum ferritin tests since the cancer diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 128/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar on the right abdomen. Results of laboratory studies, including carcinoembryonic antigen levels, are within the reference ranges. The patient reports that he generally feels fine and asks if the blood tests he undergoes during monthly visits to his primary care physician (PCP) are necessary. While reviewing the patient's electronic health record (EHR), the physician notices that the PCP has been ordering monthly complete blood counts and serum ferritin tests since the cancer diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

However, the EHR is not an appropriate tool for addressing complex topics (e.g., unnecessary testing, patient discomfort) or situations that require a detailed discussion. Furthermore, because the PCP is often the coordinator of a patient's care, and there may be an indication for the monthly blood workups that the physician is unaware of, it would be inappropriate to request discontinuation of the tests.",

However, the PCP is often the coordinator of a patient's care, and there may be an indication for the monthly blood workups that the oncologist is unaware of. Therefore, the oncologist should approach the PCP privately and inquire in a nonjudgmental manner about the reason for the monthly tests. Timely and effective communication between healthcare providers improves the quality of care, increases patient satisfaction, and reduces the incidence of medical errors. Moreover, it can help reduce unnecessary or repetitive therapeutic and diagnostic interventions, which can cause discomfort for patients, increase the risk of false positive results, and waste healthcare resources. If providers disagree because of differing processes, priorities, or levels of knowledge and training, a conflict resolution approach, such as collaboration (conflict management strategy), should be used to reach a consensus.",

        "explanation_why": "Sporotrichosis is associated with traumatic injury to the skin (e.g., a thorn prick) and most commonly occurs in gardeners and landscapers. This condition manifests at the site of traumatic injury with a papule that usually ulcerates or becomes nodular with overlying erythema; it commonly spreads proximally along lymphatic vessels (i.e., ascending lymphangitis). Systemic symptoms only occur in disseminated infections (e.g., in immunocompromised individuals). Oral itraconazole or potassium iodide is the first-line treatment for cutaneous sporotrichosis. Disseminated infections are treated with IV amphotericin B.",

Ulceroglandular tularemia manifests with an ulcer and regional lymphadenopathy, as seen here. However, systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, confusion) and a single ulcer at the entry site of the pathogen, rather than numerous nodular lesions along the lymphatic vessels, would be expected.",

        "explanation_why": "Sleep deprivation in clinicians is associated with a significantly increased rate of medical errors and should not be trivialized. When sleep deprivation has occurred, as in this case, the best management strategy is to allow the resident to go home to obtain uninterrupted sleep — and to seek a backup clinician as a replacement. The exact duration of rest is unclear, but given that sleep deprivation requires catch-up sleep, guidelines suggest a minimum of 14 hours away after 24 continuous hours of duty. Importantly, if the resident plans to drive home, an alternative should be proposed, such as a taxi ride home, a ride home from a friend, or overnight accommodations in the hospital because sleep deprivation increases the risk of motor vehicle crashes.",
        "explanation_but": "The best way to prevent acute and chronic sleep deprivation in residents is not clear. Randomized trials comparing traditional work schedules with schedules designed to reduce sleep deprivation have not shown consistent benefits in terms of patient safety outcomes. As a result, a variety of recommendations have been made, including protected time for napping, strategic intake of caffeine, lifestyle modification (e.g., good nutrition, regular exercise), and addressing sleep disorders.",
