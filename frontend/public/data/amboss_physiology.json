        "explanation_why": "These arterial blood gas findings are consistent with polycythemia vera (PV), a condition characterized by an increase in erythrocyte count and thus hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. While this results in an increased arterial O_2 content, O_2 partial pressure and O_2 saturation remain normal because these parameters mainly depend on the inhaled oxygen concentration, atmospheric pressure, and gas exchange in the lungs, none of which is affected by increased Hb concentration. Classical manifestations of PV include facial flushing and pruritus, neither of which is seen in this patient. Moreover, respiratory depression, which is seen here, would not be expected.",

        "explanation_why": "Methemoglobinemia is caused by an abundance of methemoglobin, an altered form of hemoglobin in which ferrous iron (Fe^2+) is oxidized to the ferric form (Fe^3+). Since Fe^3+ cannot bind oxygen, arterial O_2 saturation and total O_2 content decrease. This leads to functional anemia, despite normal hemoglobin concentrations. Patients with methemoglobinemia show clinical signs of cyanosis due to poor tissue oxygenation. O_2 partial pressure (PaO_2), which reflects the concentration of dissolved oxygen in plasma, is not affected. In patients prone to developing methemoglobinemia (e.g., patients with G6PD deficiency), oxidant drugs such as dapsone and topical anesthetic drugs should be avoided. Treatment consists of converting methemoglobin to hemoglobin by using reducing agents such as methylene blue and vitamin C.\n\nAlthough prolonged or chronic methemoglobinemia may lead to erythrocytosis or polycythemia, this patient has only been taking her medication for three days.\n\nSee “Overview of factors that affect oxygenation” table.",

        "explanation_why": "These arterial blood gas findings are consistent with hypoxemia (e.g., due to impaired gas exchange in the lungs). Impaired oxygenation of the blood decreases both the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma (↓ PaO_2) and the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin (↓ SaO_2). As a result, the total amount of oxygen transported by arterial blood (i.e., O_2 content) will also be reduced. In states of hypoxemia, the hemoglobin concentration is initially unaffected, but may eventually increase due to stimulation of erythropoietin secretion. Hypoxemia can cause signs of cyanosis, which are seen here. However, unlike this patient's blood sample, deoxygenated blood changes color to bright red upon exposure to oxygen.",

        "explanation_why": "These arterial blood gas findings are consistent with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning (e.g., from cigarette smoke). Since carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin (Hb) with much higher affinity than oxygen (producing carboxyhemoglobin), it cannot easily be displaced. This results in a left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, which impairs oxygen delivery to the tissues. The amount of oxygen bound to Hb (SaO_2) as well as the total arterial O_2 content are reduced, while the amount of dissolved oxygen in the plasma (PaO_2) remains unaffected. Elevated erythropoietin production secondary to chronic hypoxia induces an increase in Hb. Clinical findings of chronic carbon monoxide include dizziness and seizures, neither of which is seen here. Moreover, based on this patient's history, there is no reason to expect prolonged exposure to CO.",

This is caused by a decline in the counts of most subsets of B cells and T cells.

Physical examination shows marked tenderness and swelling of the right knee joint. There are multiple bruises on the lower extremities in various stages of healing. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 235,000/mm^3, partial thromboplastin time of 78 seconds, prothrombin time of 14 seconds, and bleeding time of 4 minutes (N = 2–7).

The extrinsic pathway is unaffected in this patient, as evidenced by the normal PT. However, hemophilia is characterized by a deficiency of factor VIII (hemophilia A) or a deficiency of factor IX (hemophilia B), both of which affect the intrinsic pathway, causing the prolonged PTT seen in this patient. While the conversion of factor X can still occur via the extrinsic pathway, the conversion of factor X by the intrinsic pathway will be impaired. A prolonged PTT with normal PT, bleeding time, and platelet count is typical of hemophilia.\n\nHemophilia C is due to a deficiency of factor XI but is exceedingly rare.",

Both of these defects initially cause a left-to-right blood shunt (i.e., acyanotic heart defect) due to higher pressures within the left heart. Over time, the increased blood flow within the right heart and the pulmonary vasculature results in permanent remodeling of pulmonary vessels and right ventricular hypertrophy. The right ventricular pressure eventually becomes higher (normal 5–10 mmHg) than the left ventricular pressure, causing a reversal of the shunt and cyanosis.",

The external branch of the SLN innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for lengthening, thinning, and stiffening the vocal cords and increases the pitch of phonation. The cricothyroid muscle is the only tensor of the vocal cord, and its denervation results in an inability to increase the pitch of the voice or produce explosive sounds as well as easy voice fatigability.",

A third pyramidal lobe extending from the isthmus is present in 50% of patients. This third lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct.The parathyroid glands are located posterior to the thyroid gland; they may vary in number and location. The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) branch off from the vagus nerve; the left RLN loops under the aortic arch, and the right RLN passes beneath the subclavian artery. Both RLNs are vulnerable to injury during thyroid surgery as they ascend to the larynx behind the thyroid gland. Unilateral RLN injury may result in hoarseness, and bilateral RLN injury may cause dyspnea and stridor.",

Hypoparathyroidism is the most frequent complication of total or near-total thyroidectomy. However, the superior parathyroid glands are most commonly found inferior to the superior thyroid artery and the external branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and are thus less likely to be injured in this patient.",

While unilateral RLN injury can occur during thyroid surgery, the nerve is unlikely to be damaged during ligation of the superior thyroid artery.

The pathophysiology that underlies the development of necrolytic migratory erythema is not well understood, but it may be related to direct action of glucagon on the skin, protein deficiency (because glucagon causes proteolysis), and/or a deficiency of zinc and fatty acids due to chronic diarrhea.\n\nSee “Overview of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors” table.",

Menopause is usually preceded by the climacteric period, in which the menstrual cycles become increasingly irregular before amenorrhea begins. Ovarian failure leads to a decrease in the circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone, resulting in a decrease in negative feedback to the hypothalamus. This results in an increase in GnRH levels and subsequent increase in FSH.\n\nDue to the wide variability of FSH levels in women, it is no longer routinely tested to diagnose menopause, which is instead determined on a clinical basis.",

The measured HCO_3^- (33 mEq/L) is consistent with a secondary metabolic alkalosis in the setting of primary acute respiratory acidosis because the measured HCO_3^- is more than what would be expected for acute respiratory acidosis (24 + [0.1 x (pCO_2  in mm Hg - 40)] +/- 3 = 24–30 mEq/L). Although this patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory acidosis due to an opioid overdose, there is, however, no history to suggest an additional metabolic alkalosis (e.g., diuretic use, severe vomiting).\n\nThe measured HCO_3^- is within the range of the expected HCO_3^- for a single chronic respiratory acidosis (24 + [0.4 x (pCO_2  in mm Hg - 40)] +/- 3 = 33–39 mEq/L) but the acute nature of an opioid overdose makes chronic respiratory acidosis unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "This ABG analysis suggests acute respiratory acidosis, which is seen in an opioid overdose as a result of hypoventilation. Decreased pH indicates acidosis, increased pCO_2 suggests a respiratory source and, due to the acute nature of an opioid overdose, only minimal metabolic compensation from the rapid action of buffers in blood would be expected. In acute respiratory acidosis, for every 10 mm Hg increase in pCO_2 above 40 mm Hg, the HCO_3^- concentration increases by 1 mEq/L from 24 mEq/L with an expected variability of +/- 3 mEq/L. A slow-onset but more substantial compensation occurs as a result of renal acid-base handling in chronic respiratory acid-base disorders.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for acute respiratory acidosis in the emergency department setting include airway obstruction (e.g., foreign body aspiration, acute exacerbations of obstructive lung diseases), neuromuscular etiologies (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic crisis, botulism), and overdoses with other drugs that can cause CNS depression (e.g., benzodiazepines).",

DVT is the most common cause of pulmonary embolism (PE), which typically presents with sharp chest pain and shortness of breath, as seen here. In PE, occlusion of one or more of the pulmonary arteries leads to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, which results in an increased A-a gradient and hypoxemia. In turn, hypoxemia leads to hyperventilation and subsequent respiratory alkalosis (due to low PCO_2 levels). Certain medications including raloxifene increase the risk of DVT and PE.",

Although sweat glands are primarily innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, they have muscarinic receptors and are therefore activated by acetylcholine, unlike all other sympathetic pathways. Due to the cholinergic activity of bethanechol, diaphoresis is the most likely adverse effect in this patient.\n\nPostoperative urinary retention commonly occurs after surgeries (especially anorectal surgeries involving spinal anesthesia).",

        "explanation_why": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to a drop in serum calcium levels, increases serum calcium by stimulating the reabsorption of calcium from the renal distal tubules, the production of calcitriol in the kidneys, and the release of calcium from bone. Hypercalcemia (e.g., due to milk-alkali syndrome) inhibits PTH secretion, which is why PTH levels would most likely be decreased (not increased) in this patient. Hypercalcemia in combination with increased PTH levels is seen in primary hyperparathyroidism (e.g., due to parathyroid gland adenomas).",

There is no history of starvation or alcohol use in this patient. DKA is seen primarily in patients with type I diabetes mellitus, as opposed to type II diabetes mellitus.

Hypercalcemia due to milk-alkali syndrome is typically associated with decreased, not increased levels of phosphate.

A mechanism that occurs in response to hypercalcemia (e.g., due to milk-alkali syndrome) is increased renal conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, an inactive intermediate in vitamin D metabolism; in addition, there is decreased conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the most active form of vitamin D. Since calcitriol normally increases serum calcium concentrations (via effects on the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys), decreased formation of calcitriol results in a reduction in serum calcium concentrations.",

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is associated with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), a structural defect of the mitral valves due to myxomatous degeneration that leads to the bulging of the leaflets into the left atrium during systole.",

The click may be followed by a mid-to-late systolic murmur indicating mitral regurgitation. Since the prolapse occurs when the contracting ventricle reaches a critical volume, the timing of the click varies according to the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV). Decreased EDV, e.g., due to decreased venous return to the heart during abrupt standing (i.e., decreased preload) causes the leaflets to prolapse sooner, resulting in an earlier onset (i.e., closer to S1) and increased intensity of auscultatory findings. Conversely, maneuvers that increase the volume (e.g., squatting) result in a later onset and decreased intensity.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased arterial pCO_2 due to excessive supplemental oxygen is the most likely explanation for this patient's somnolence. Oxygen therapy in patients with chronically impaired oxygenation from COPD should be titrated to a saturation of 88–92% to avoid oxygen-induced hypercapnia and CO_2 narcosis, which is seen here. Alveolar hyperoxia inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to increased perfusion of poorly ventilated alveoli (i.e., worsening ventilation-perfusion mismatch). The resulting increased dead space ventilation is thought to be the major contributor to acute hypercapnia. In addition, accumulating oxyhemoglobin facilitates CO_2 release from RBCs (Haldane effect). Contrary to prior belief, reduced hypoxic respiratory drive is only responsible for a small increase of pCO_2.",

This effect facilitates the uptake and transport of CO_2 from the periphery to the lungs. However, this patient is receiving 100% oxygen at 10 L/min via face mask, which results in a high PaO_2 and a high fraction of oxygenated blood. As the CO_2 affinity to hemoglobin is inversely proportional to the oxygenation of hemoglobin (i.e., Haldane effect), a decrease in CO_2 affinity of hemoglobin would be expected in this patient.",

This process can cause inflammation, interstitial thickening, and vascular dysfunction, which can result in pulmonary arterial hypertension and subsequent right-sided heart failure. However, right heart failure secondary to connective tissue disorders is commonly a late complication that is preceded by a long history of systemic symptoms (skin manifestations, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility).

Over time, this can result in right ventricular strain, hypertrophy, and, ultimately, right-sided heart failure. Although LHF with systolic dysfunction is the most common cause of right-sided heart failure, it is unlikely to be the underlying cause of this patient's condition, since he has a normal ejection fraction (∼ 60%) and shows no signs of left-sided heart failure (e.g., pulmonary edema with dyspnea, bilateral basilar rales).",

COPD is characterized by pulmonary inflammation resulting in fibrosis, airway obstruction, and capillary loss. Subsequent hypoxia and hypercapnia cause compensatory pulmonary vasoconstriction. The combination of hypoxic vasoconstriction and chronic inflammation triggers vascular remodeling, which, in turn, causes elevated pulmonary capillary pressure and pulmonary hypertension. Chronic, untreated pulmonary hypertension puts a strain on the right ventricle, causing concentric hypertrophy and progressive decline in right cardiac function, eventually leading to symptoms of decompensated right heart failure, as seen in this patient.",

Of these compounds, tryptase is a relatively specific marker of mast cell activation.\n\nIn the late phase of anaphylactic reactions, inflammatory cells (e.g., eosinophils) and cytokines mediate inflammation and tissue damage.",

Although serum sickness (or a serum-sickness like reaction) may present with urticaria, this patient lacks other characteristic findings such as fever, arthralgia, proteinuria, and lymphadenopathy. Moreover, serum sickness typically occurs 1–2 weeks after antigen exposure (unlike this patient's acute-onset symptoms). Cathepsin is not released by surface crosslinking of IgE.",

Epigastric pain is not common in posterior wall myocardial infarctions, nor are conduction abnormalities, since the posterior interventricular artery does not supply the conduction system.",

            "description": "12-lead ECG (paper speed: 25 mm/s)– Heart rate: ~ 83/min\n– Sinus rhythm\n– Normal axis (R > S in I and II)\n– Downsloping ST depression in leads V_2 and V_3 and horizontal ST depression in V_4 (examples indicated by red overlay) is accompanied by positive T waves (examples indicated by blue overlay). This appearance is reciprocal to posterior ST elevations with T-wave inversions.\n– Dominant R waves (R/S ratio > 1) in V_2 (example indicated by green overlay): reciprocal to posterior Q waves\n– Right bundle branch block (RBBB): rSR′ complex in V_1 and QRS duration of 0.12 sThese findings suggest a posterior myocardial infarction. To confirm, an additional ECG including the posterior leads V7–V9 can be obtained to look for ST elevation, T-wave inversion, and Q waves. Note that ST depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1–V4 is a STEMI-equivalent ECG finding (i.e., management is the same as that for STEMI).",

        "explanation_why": "Failure of the ductus arteriosus to completely close postnatally allows blood to flow from the descending aorta back to the pulmonary artery (left-to-right shunt). In a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), this leads to volume overload of the right ventricle and the lung circuit. This increased blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension and irreversible remodeling of small pulmonary vessels, which may eventually lead to an Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). This patient's palpable right parasternal heave and pronounced S_2 are evidence of increased right heart strain. In patients with a large PDA, the features of differential cyanosis occur once shunt reversal develops. Because the ductus is located on the descending aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, reversal of the shunt results in deoxygenated blood reaching only the lower body. Due to the rise in pulmonary pressure, the characteristic continuous machine-like murmur heard in patients with PDA eventually disappears.\n\nInfants with PDA usually receive an infusion of indomethacin to induce closure of the duct, while in older children symptomatic PDAs are typically closed surgically or via percutaneous catheter occlusion. The presence of an Eisenmenger reaction is, however, a contraindication to a PDA closure.",

    "hint": "Sudden, transient loss of vision (amaurosis fugax) in an elderly female with a history of unilateral headaches and jaw claudication suggests giant cell arteritis (GCA). Proximal muscle pain and stiffness should raise suspicion for concurrent polymyalgia rheumatica. The presence of anemia (conjunctival pallor) and a significantly elevated ESR further support the diagnosis of GCA. High-dose glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment for GCA.",

    "hint": "Watery diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, episodic cutaneous flushing triggered by eating or emotional events, asthma-like attacks, and a murmur indicative of tricuspid regurgitation are highly suggestive of carcinoid syndrome.

The unregulated production of VIP leads to excessive secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. Cutaneous flushing is seen in about 20% of patients with VIPoma. However, abdominal pain is usually mild or absent. Furthermore, this etiology does not explain why the patient also presents with a tricuspid murmur and asthma, neither of which are typical findings of VIPomas.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Dermatitis is a characteristic feature of pellagra, or niacin deficiency; other key findings include dementia and diarrhea (i.e., the “three Ds”). Dermatitis in patients with pellagra is characterized by a symmetrical, pigmented, scaly thickening of the skin in sun-exposed areas, such as the limbs and around the neck (casal necklace). The increased metabolism of serotonin in neuroendocrine neoplasms depletes the amount of tryptophan precursors available for other organic compounds, including niacin. A lack of niacin leads to decreased production of the coenzymes NAD+ and NADP+, which are essential in redox reactions throughout cellular metabolism. Diagnosis is confirmed via 24-hour urine testing for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the end product of serotonin metabolism.\n\nIn developed countries, pellagra is most commonly seen in patients with alcohol use disorder or as a complication of malabsorption. It can also occur in Hartnup disease (due to renal and intestinal loss of tryptophan) or after prolonged use of isoniazid (due to decreased levels of vitamin B6, which is essential for the production of niacin).",

Specific causes for folate deficiency include the use of folate antagonists, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency is seen in pernicious anemia or after gastrectomy.

The patient could have undergone a silent MI, but, since myocardial scars are marked by complete replacement with fibrous, non-contractile tissue, there would be permanent dyskinesia on echocardiography even after revascularization. Scar tissue can also lead to a true ventricular aneurysm, which would then manifest as an outward bulge of the affected segment during myocardial contraction.",

        "explanation_why": "Pulsus paradoxus is most commonly caused by severe obstructive lung disease (e.g., COPD, asthma) or constrictive cardiac disease (e.g., cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, tension pneumothorax). Increased airway resistance in obstructive lung disease leads to a significant decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inhalation, which increases venous return to the right atrium and ventricle. The enlarged right ventricle then exerts pressure on the left ventricle, resulting in a decrease in stroke volume and a drop in inspiratory blood pressure.\n\nIn constrictive cardiac disease, the pericardial space is unable to compensate for inspiratory venous return, leading to pulsus paradoxus. In a pathologically constricted heart, the increase in right ventricular volume causes bowing of the right ventricle into the left ventricle, resulting in decreased left ventricular filling and cardiac output, and a subsequent drop in systolic blood pressure.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "The presence of jugular venous distention suggests right heart failure, which can manifest with findings such as exertional shortness of breath and chest pain, as seen here. Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause pulmonary embolism, resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. A mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest confirms the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, and a normal PCWP (4–12 mm Hg) excludes left heart failure as the cause.",

Afferent arteriole dilation and efferent arteriole constriction then work in combination to maintain a constant GFR despite decreased cardiac output. Right heart failure is a condition that can cause systemic hypoperfusion. For this reason dilatation (not constriction) of the renal afferent arteriole would rather be expected in this patient.",

These headaches are either mild-to-moderate and occur immediately after drug administration (due to nitric oxide-induced vasodilation) or migraine-like, occurring several hours after drug intake (due to nitric oxide-mediated release of neurotransmitters such as calcitonin gene-related peptide and glutamate, and/or altered ion channel function). Nitrate-induced vasodilation decreases both preload and afterload and improves myocardial perfusion, but may also result in cutaneous flushing and hypotension.\n\nOther adverse effects include gastroesophageal reflux and reflex tachycardia, the latter of which can be treated with beta blockers.",

        "explanation_why": "Factor VII is the only coagulation factor listed here that is part of the extrinsic hemostatic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is activated by traumatic tissue injury, such as this patient's tooth extraction, which exposes tissue factor (factor III) located beneath the endothelium. Factor III then activates factor VII, forming a complex to trigger the common pathway by activating factor X. Hereditary factor VII deficiency is rare and is caused by a mutation of the F7 gene on chromosome 13. Factor VII deficiency presents with features similar to those of hemophilia (factor VIII or factor IX deficiency), such as bleeding following dental extraction and hemarthrosis. However, in patients with factor VII deficiency, the PT would be prolonged (due to an extrinsic pathway defect) and the aPTT would be normal. Conversely, in patients with hemophilia, the aPTT is prolonged (due to an intrinsic pathway defect) and the PT is normal.",

During the storage phase, contraction of the trigone and sphincter muscles due to stimulation of α1 receptors at these sites maintains continence. Bladder wall contraction due to stimulation of M3 receptors in the detrusor muscle, and reflex inhibition of the trigone and sphincter allows for micturition to occur during the voiding phase. Muscarinic antagonists (e.g. tolterodine, oxybutynin, solifenacin, dicyclomine) and the newly developed β3 agonists (e.g., mirabegron) relax detrusor muscles, and can therefore be used to treat urge incontinence caused by an overactive detrusor muscle.",

            "title": "Baroreceptor and chemoreceptor pathways",
            "description": "Baroreceptors are stretch receptors that are located in the carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch of the aorta. Baroreceptors sense minute blood pressure (BP) changes and send afferent signals to the brain stem (nucleus tractus solitarius) via the vagus nerve from the aortic arch and the glossopharyngeal nerve from the carotid sinus. The brainstem modulates autonomic outflow to alter the heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance to normalize BP (i.e., ↓ BP → sympathetic stimulation → ↑ HR, ↑ peripheral vascular resistance → ↑ BP; ↑ BP → parasympathetic stimulation → ↓ HR and ↓ peripheral vascular resistance → ↓BP). This pathway is known as the baroreflex.A prolonged decrease in BP also stimulates long-term homeostatic mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway (RAAS) and ADH secretion (↑ ADH release → ↓ water excretion by the kidneys → ↑ intravascular volume → ↑ BP).Chemoreceptors detect minute changes in pH and partial pressures of respiratory gases. Peripheral chemoreceptors, located in the carotid body and aortic body, are stimulated by a fall in pH and pO_2 or a rise in pCO_2, which occurs in hypoxia. Chemoreceptors send afferent signals to the brain stem (dorsal respiratory group) via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, which stimulates the respiratory centers of the brain, resulting in an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. Chemoreceptor stimulation also increases the sympathetic outflow to the heart.",

Hypovolemic hyponatremia is a characteristic feature of diabetic ketoacidosis and occurs due to the osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia and glucosuria. In dilutional hyponatremia, increased serum osmolality from hyperglycemia causes water to shift from the intracellular to the extracellular space, resulting in a decreased serum sodium concentration.

Increased bilirubin production contributes to black pigment stones in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias, such as hereditary spherocytosis. Hemolysis results in the increased breakdown of hemoglobin to heme and subsequently to bilirubin. Bile supersaturated with bilirubin can precipitate and form gallstones. Gallstones in pregnancy are usually due to a different cause.",

Moreover, higher progesterone levels cause smooth muscle relaxation, decreased and incomplete emptying of the gallbladder, and subsequent bile stasis. Together, cholesterol-rich lithogenic bile and gallbladder stasis predispose to gallstone formation. Similarly, hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptive use also predispose to cholelithiasis.",

            "description": "(1) Hemoglobin is broken down into heme and globin in the spleen and, to a lesser extent, in the bone marrow.\n(2) Macrophages break heme down into unconjugated bilirubin. Bound to albumin, unconjugated bilirubin is transported in the bloodstream and taken up by the liver.\n(3) Bilirubin is conjugated in the liver and secreted in bile.\n(4) In order to be secreted, conjugated bilirubin enters the blood to reach the hepatocytes with a direct connection to the bile canaliculi. At this stage, conjugated bilirubin is detectable in the blood.\n(5) Bilirubin reaches the intestine via the bile. Intestinal bacteria convert bilirubin to urobilinogen.\n(6) Most of the urobilinogen is converted into stercobilinogen and then stercobilin. Stercobilin is excreted via the stool, giving it its characteristic brown color.\n(7) A smaller portion of urobilinogen is reabsorbed and follows two different paths:\n→ (8) Most of it undergoes hepatobiliary recirculation, while the rest is filtrated in the kidney.\n→ Or: (9) The remainder gets filtrated in the kidneys. in the urine, urobilinogen is oxidized to urobilin, which is responsible for the characteristic yellow color.",

Under physiological conditions, parathyroid chief cells maintain calcium homeostasis through PTH-mediated increases in bone resorption, renal calcium absorption, and phosphate excretion. This patient's hypercalcemia is most likely caused by excessive production and secretion of parathyroid hormone (primary hyperparathyroidism). The most common causes of primary hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid adenoma (approx. 80% of cases) and hyperplasia (approx. 15% of cases).",

Destruction of normal pituitary tissue by a large pituitary adenoma can lead to reduced production of FSH/LH, GH, ACTH, TSH, and ADH (panhypopituitarism).

Diabetes inspidius caused by ADH deficiency would result in increased frequency of micturition due to polyuria.

        "explanation_why": "Human placental lactogen causes pancreatic beta-cell hyperplasia and leads to an increase in insulin (and C-peptide) secretion as well as maternal insulin resistance. This ensures adequate glucose availability for the fetus. If maternal pancreatic function does not overcome insulin resistance, patients can develop gestational diabetes. In response to increased serum glucose concentrations, fetal production of insulin increases, which leads to increased fetal growth (macrosomia) as seen in this case.\n\nScreening for gestational diabetes is recommended for all pregnant women because this condition increases the risk of maternal and fetal complications such as preeclampsia and birth trauma. Most patients are usually asymptomatic. Diagnosis and appropriate therapy of gestational diabetes mellitus can decrease fetal and maternal morbidity.",

The level of hCG rises rapidly during the first trimester and gradually declines after that. It has no functional role in lactogenesis.",

Secretory initiation occurs during the second half of pregnancy, when high levels of circulating progesterone directly inhibit prolactin-induced milk production. Delivery of the placenta causes a rapid decline in progesterone. This decline triggers secretion of high levels of prolactin, cortisol, and insulin, which propel the second stage of lactogenesis. Secretory activation usually occurs on the second or third day post-partum and is marked by breast swelling and copious milk production.\n\nOccasionally, retained pieces of placenta may result in difficulty with lactation due to the ongoing production of progesterone.",

DHT is the main androgen of prostate growth and the pathogenesis of BPH. Treatment with finasteride results in lower intraprostatic DHT, inhibited prostatic growth, apoptosis, and involution, which can reduce prostate volume by up to 30% in men with BPH and relieve LUTS. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors also reduce PSA levels by approx. 50%, which must be considered when screening for prostate cancer. They are especially beneficial in men with large prostate volumes but may take > 6 months to become effective. For this reason, alpha-1 antagonists are usually preferred for rapid improvement of symptoms.",

Tadalafil is currently approved for use in the treatment of BPH with comorbid erectile dysfunction (ED), which this patient does not have. The precise mechanism by which tadalafil reduces LUTS in BPH remains unknown, but increased cGMP concentrations in the bladder and prostate smooth muscle are likely to play a role.

However, in normal respiration, the shape is only noticeable in the curve of the entire respiratory tract (purple). In each of the curves, the compliance is highest at the steepest part of the curve (advantageous for resting breathing).\nAt the upper white dot, where the static pressure-volume curve of the thorax passes by 0 in pressure, the thorax is in resting position. At the lower white dot, where the static pressure-volume curve of the respiratory tract passes by 0 in pressure, the elastic forces of the thorax and of the lung are balanced (respiratory rest position).With maximum expiration, the static pressure-volume curve of the lung reaches 0 in pressure.

However, aortic stenosis produces a mid-to-late systolic murmur instead of the early murmur in this patient and it does not explain this patient's loud S_1.

        "explanation_why": "Increased pulmonary vascular resistance is seen in pulmonary hypertension, which can cause a loud S_2 in the second intercostal space as well as a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (S_vO_2). However, the loud S_2 would be due to a loud P_2 and would, therefore, be heard best at the left 2^nd intercostal space (pulmonary area). Moreover, if S_vO_2 was decreased in a patient with pulmonary hypertension, the oxygen saturation would also be decreased. Also, pulmonary hypertension alone does not explain the loud S_1 and the murmur in this patient.",

        "explanation_why": "Dyspnea, tachycardia, and evidence of hyperdynamic circulation (e.g., loud S_1/S_2, systolic ejection murmur due to increased blood flow) are features of severe anemia. In patients with anemia, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P_aO_2), which reflects dissolved oxygen content, and the arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (S_aO_2) remain normal. However, the total arterial oxygen content (C_aO_2), which is given by the formula [1.34 x S_aO_2 x hemoglobin concentration] + [0.003 x P_aO_2]), would be decreased because the total hemoglobin concentration is decreased. Therefore, the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues (DO_2) is decreased and tissues extract more oxygen per gram of hemoglobin in order to meet the metabolic demands (VO_2). This results in a decreased hemoglobin oxygen saturation in venous blood, which is measured by S_vO_2.",
        "explanation_but": "Other causes of decreased S_vO_2 include decreased DO_2 due to hypoxemia caused by a lung disease, increased tissue O_2 extraction due to decreased cardiac output (e.g., heart failure, hypovolemic shock), increased VO_2 (e.g., exercise, high fever, seizures), and an inability of hemoglobin to bind to O_2 (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning). If S_vO_2 is decreased as a result of decreased cardiac output or increased VO_2, S_aO_2 would usually be normal. However, pulse oximetry may erroneously show a decreased oxygen saturation in the case of decreased cardiac output because of poor peripheral circulation. If S_vO_2 is decreased as a result of lung disease or carbon monoxide poisoning, S_aO_2 would also be decreased. However, pulse oximetry may erroneously show a normal oxygen saturation in the case of carbon monoxide poisoning because carboxyhemoglobin has a cherry red color. Estimation of true S_aO_2 requires arterial blood gas analysis.",

This change is caused by secretion of relaxin and progesterone during pregnancy, which causes significant vasodilation, decreasing systemic vascular resistance, increasing cardiac output, and increasing renal blood flow. Increased amounts of solutes enter the renal tubules and overload sodium/glucose cotransporters (SGLT2), which results in glucosuria.",

Therefore, a high serum sodium concentration will lead to decreased sodium reabsorption in the tubules, and both a parallel reduction in calcium transport and an increase of calcium excretion. In fact, patients with recurrent calcium stones are often recommended low-sodium diets to enhance sodium (and calcium) reabsorption.",

This patient likely had a spinal cord lesion near the level of T10 (decreased sensation below the umbilicus), which is now causing sympathetic stimulation of the urethral sphincter, as evidenced by the urodynamic studies. Alpha blockers are also a first-line therapy in urinary retention due to outflow tract obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The left atrium has to contract against the partially closed mitral valve, which results in an increased left atrial pressure. Once repaired, left atrial outflow increases, thereby decreasing the left atrial pressure. The left ventricular input increases, thereby increasing the left ventricular pressure. The right ventricular pressure remains unchanged. These hemodynamic changes would not, however, be expected after the closure of a VSD.",

        "explanation_why": "A VSD causes left-to-right shunting of blood because the left ventricular pressure is physiologically higher than the right ventricular pressure due to the thicker ventricular wall and higher force of contraction. Closure of a VSD would, therefore, increase the amount of blood in the left ventricle and decrease the amount of blood in the right ventricle during each cardiac cycle. This results in an increase in left ventricular pressure and a decrease in right ventricular pressure as well as right ventricular output, which translates to a decrease in the amount of blood flowing into the left atrium and therefore a decrease in left atrial pressure.",

Blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (white arrow) along the pressure gradient (1). This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

A bilateral decrease in both ventilation and perfusion can be seen in patients with emphysema due to the destruction of both the alveoli and the capillary bed.

However, the increased blood volume can also exacerbate pre-existing heart valve disease. In the case of mitral stenosis, blood backs up before the mitral valve and increases pressure within the pulmonary circulation, which is the most likely explanation for this patient's worsening dyspnea.\n\nIn contrast to plasma volume, RBC volume only increases by 20–30% during pregnancy. This subsequently leads to dilutional anemia and decreased viscosity.",

Pulmonary embolism is most likely to occur during pregnancy, whereas amniotic fluid embolism may occur during labor. However, embolisms are characterized by an acute onset of dyspnea, whereas this patient has a 2-month history of worsening dyspnea. In addition, although the exacerbation of this patient's mitral stenosis could eventually lead to increased right ventricular afterload due to secondary increased pressure in pulmonary circulation, she shows no other signs of right heart strain (e.g., peripheral edema, raised JVP) and increased right ventricular afterload would not contribute to her dyspnea.",

Unlike this patient, however, individuals with Kallmann syndrome can present with normal or even above average height. In this syndrome, impaired sex steroid production allows the epiphyses to remain open longer than normal. Additionally, Kallmann syndrome manifests most commonly in males and secondary sexual characteristics are typically fully absent, whereas this female patient presents with Tanner stage 2 breast development. Finally, affected patients classically present with anosmia as a direct result of defective migration of GnRH-producing neurons, which is not present here.",

        "explanation_why": "Self-imposed restriction of food intake is a hallmark of restrictive-type anorexia nervosa, which is characterized by a significant and deliberate reduction in body mass using strategies that include restrictive eating, purging, and excessive exercise. Eating disorders can result in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, delayed onset of puberty, and even short stature in severe presentations, as seen in this patient. However, patients with anorexia nervosa are often underweight, with a BMI below the 10^th percentile, while this patient presents with a normal BMI relative to her stature. Other characteristics of anorexia nervosa include body image disturbances, an intense fear of weight gain, preoccupation with body weight and shape, as well as complications affecting most major organ systems including hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia, none of which are seen in this patient.",

        "explanation_why": "Delayed pulsatile release of gonadotropins (triggered by a pulsatile release of GnRH) during the night is consistent with constitutional growth delay, the most common cause of delayed puberty. Patients classically display a bone age less than their chronological age, delayed puberty, and family history (\"late-blooming\") of delayed growth and puberty. Birth weight and height are typically normal, but patients fall behind in growth between 6 months to 3 years of age, after which they regain their low-normal growth rate. Although the onset of pulsatile GnRH secretion necessary for puberty is delayed, laboratory studies often show only mildly decreased or low-normal total serum GnRH, LH, FSH, and estrogen levels. Patients with constitutional growth delay usually achieve normal adult stature and sexual development.",

TS is a type of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, characterized by decreased serum estrogen. However, TS does not cause delayed bone age. Moreover, this patient lacks other characteristic features of TS such as shield chest, webbed neck, and cardiovascular abnormalities.",

        "explanation_why": "A loss of function mutation in the gene encoding the androgen receptor leads to complete androgen insensitive syndrome (CAIS), whereby patients are karyotypically male (46, XY), but phenotypically female. Lack of negative feedback leads to overproduction of androgens, which are subsequently aromatized to estrogens, causing external female genitalia, and breast development in puberty. Patients not identified at birth may present due to primary amenorrhea; however, this is due to the lack of a uterus with a blind-ending vagina. Additionally, growth is typically normal and patients with CAIS will often experience a pubertal growth spurt, resulting in an adult height similar to normal females.",

Fat malabsorption itself should not affect water-soluble vitamins, though some conditions include deficiency in both (e.g., concomitant B, D, and iron deficiency in celiac disease). Folic acid deficiency, for instance, can occur with a decreased intestinal surface area to absorb nutrients, increased physical demand (pregnancy), or decreased dietary intake. Pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency) can be due to intestinal malabsorption or lack of intrinsic factor. Thiamine deficiency is commonly observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder or diets reliant on polished rice and milled white cereals.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia predisposes to the development of black or brown pigment gallstones, which are a risk factor for acute pancreatitis.

This enzymatic pathway is the underlying pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis, regardless of the etiology (e.g., pancreatic ductal blockage in gallstone pancreatitis, pancreatic acinar injury in alcohol-induced pancreatitis). Hereditary pancreatitis, which this patient most likely has, is usually caused by a mutated PRSS1 gene that promotes intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation.\n\nOther genetic variants associated with chronic pancreatitis are mutations in SPINK 1 and CFTR genes.",

    "hint": "Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) used to treat Alzheimer disease. The most common adverse effects of AChEIs involve peristalsis and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle cramps, as seen in this patient. These symptoms are caused by repeated muscarinic receptor activation due to accumulation of ACh in the synaptic cleft. If this effect is not reversed, additional symptoms can develop, such as excessive lacrimation and bronchial secretion, as well as increased bowel and bladder activity, bronchospasm, and bradycardia.",

        "explanation_why": "Hemophilias are hereditary disorders of secondary hemostasis that can manifest with prolonged bleeding after surgery (e.g., tooth extraction), hemarthrosis, and hematomas. Depending on the severity of clotting factor deficiency, bleeding may occur spontaneously or in response to trauma. Hemophilia A, which is caused by deficiency of factor VIII, and hemophilia B, which is caused by deficiency of factor IX, both follow an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. Since hemophilia A (∼ 80% of cases) is much more common than hemophilia B (∼ 20% of cases), this patient most likely has hemophilia A.\n\nTreatment of hemophilia A includes desmopressin, or in severe cases, substitution of factor VIII. Repeated hemarthrosis can eventually lead to joint destruction, a serious long-term complication of hemophilia.",

        "explanation_why": "Hepcidin is an acute phase reactant that is produced and released by hepatocytes in response to the activation of iron-sensing receptors (e.g., HFE, HJV, and TFR2 proteins) on their surface. Hepcidin synthesis is increased in states of inflammation or high transferrin-bound iron levels (indicating iron overload) and decreased in the setting of hypoxia or increased erythropoiesis. As the body's main regulator of iron metabolism, hepcidin inhibits the absorption of iron from duodenal enterocytes into the bloodstream and iron release from macrophages by binding and degrading ferroportin. In chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), the trapping of iron results in decreased serum iron levels and increased iron stores, as evidenced by the elevated ferritin in this patient. The change in serum iron levels and iron stores results in iron being unavailable for the synthesis of new hemoglobin, which can lead to anemia of chronic disease. The mainstay of treatment for anemia of chronic disease is management of the underlying disorder.",

            "description": "Intraluminal ferric iron (i.e., dietary iron or heme) is converted to ferrous iron (Fe^2+) by ascorbate ferrireductase and transported into the enterocyte via the DMT-1 transporter. Fe^2+ is then either stored as ferritin or transported to the circulation (shaded red area) to contribute towards hematopoiesis. This circulating Fe^2+ from dietary or other sources (i.e., apoferritin stores in the liver, breakdown of hemoglobin) is then recycled to form new hemoglobin molecules within the medullary and extramedullary sites of hematopoiesis or exported and stored as ferritin within the hepatocytes. Iron metabolism is controlled by the hepcidin protein, which is produced in response to increased levels of plasma iron, inflammation, or the HFE protein, and acts to inhibit iron uptake into the circulation.",

Within the lungs, this permeability results in an exudative pleural effusion, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This pathophysiology is further supported by this patient's x-ray findings, hypoxia, and dyspnea.

In contrast, increased lung pressure during a pulmonary inflammatory event, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in this patient, would prevent deoxygenated blood from circulating through the lung vasculature.

As a result, the duration of the effective refractory period increases, which results in PR interval prolongation on ECG. Class IV antiarrhythmics do not affect the QT interval.",

Class III antiarrhythmics inhibit potassium channels which are responsible for repolarization of the cardiac membrane.

All class III antiarrhythmics, with the exception of amiodarone, exhibit reverse use-dependence, as seen during this patient's cardiac stress testing.

Training at high altitudes leads to decreased P_aO_2 and consequent tissue hypoxia, triggering compensatory hyperventilation, which increases exhalation of CO_2, causing respiratory alkalosis. Renal reabsorption of HCO_3^- decreases in response to respiratory alkalosis, and the secretion of H^+ into the renal tubules is reduced. These mechanisms help lower plasma bicarbonate levels and bring the pH closer to normal. The expected HCO_3^- concentration in mEq/L can be estimated using the formula: 24 - [0.4 x (40 - PaCO_2 in mm Hg)], or by applying the clinical rule that HCO_3^- decreases by 4–5 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg decrease in PaCO_2 below 40 mm Hg.

The negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of beta-1 receptor antagonism would decrease myocardial oxygen demand. This is beneficial in patients with angina. However, inhibition of beta-2 receptors would lead to bronchoconstriction, which would decrease FEV_1 and worsen air trapping in patients with obstructive lung diseases such as COPD and asthma. Therefore, nonselective beta blockers (e.g., labetalol, propranolol, nadolol, pindolol, timolol, carvedilol) should be avoided in this group of patients.",

The failure of ATP-gated Cl^- channels (encoded by CFTR) to function leads to a decrease in Cl^- in lung secretions. This, in turn, results in an increase in the activity of Na^+ channels, which reabsorb Na^+ ions into cells until an extremely positive gradient is created. These ion changes stimulate passive reabsorption of water from bronchial mucous into the cells and interstitium, resulting in abnormally thick bronchial secretions.\n\nReabsorption of Na^+ results in a nasal transepithelial potential difference that is more negative than normal. This increased difference in electrical potential is helpful in diagnosing cystic fibrosis.",

Chloride and sodium are normally in equilibrium, but the accumulation of intracellular chloride due to the absence of a transporter results in the retention of intracellular sodium and water (due to osmosis). This ultimately results in hyperviscous mucus, which causes blockages of small organs and airways, inflammation, and end-organ damage.",

Glucose entry into the cells increases the intracellular ATP concentration, which arrests the flow of K^+ and depolarizes the membrane, initiating insulin release. Defects of the gene encoding ATP-sensitive K^+ channels result in hypoinsulinemia, which results in neonatal diabetes mellitus and failure to thrive. However, the gene is located on chromosome 11, not 7.",

        "explanation_why": "Fatigue and shortness of breath in a patient with these normal arterial blood findings could be caused by acute cyanide poisoning, which impairs the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and causes histotoxic hypoxia. Cyanide poisoning has no effect on O_2 content or PaO_2. Because the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen also remains unchanged, SaO_2 and the O_2-Hb dissociation curve are unaffected. However, this patient's symptoms have been present for 8 months and are unlikely to be caused by cyanide poisoning. In addition, he lacks classical manifestations of this condition such as almond-scented breath and bright red skin tone. Moreover, this set of findings is not consistent with this patient's anemia.",

            "description": "Uncoupling agents (e.g., salicylic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and thermogenin) act by increasing the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane, resulting in the dissociation of the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase complex.Respiratory chain inhibitors target specific protein complexes of the electron transport chain. Electron transport chain inhibitors (e.g., rotenone, malonate, antimycin A, and certain toxic substances such as cyanide and aspirin in toxic doses) block ATP synthesis by inhibiting the proton gradient. ATP synthase inhibitors (e.g., oligomycin) block ATP synthesis by inhibiting ATP synthase, the protein complex that catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi).",

Both carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin cause a left shift of the O_2-Hb dissociation curve because they increase the affinity of the remaining oxyhemoglobin for oxygen. As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced, which decreases both O_2 saturation and O_2 content. PaO_2, which reflects the concentration of dissolved oxygen in arterial blood, remains normal. However, this patient has no history of exposure to carbon monoxide (e.g., domestic fire) or substances that could induce methemoglobinemia (e.g., nitrates). Moreover, this set of findings is not consistent with this patient's anemia.",

In addition, because the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen remains unchanged, O_2 saturation and the O_2-Hb dissociation curve are unaffected. Although PV is associated with fatigue, this patient lacks classical manifestations of this condition such as facial flushing and pruritus.

PaO_2 and SaO_2 depend on the inhaled oxygen concentration, atmospheric pressure, and gas exchange in the lungs, none of which are affected by anemia. O_2 content is affected by PaO_2 (normal), SaO_2  (normal), and hemoglobin concentration (decreased), and is therefore decreased in this patient. In addition, the O_2-Hb dissociation curve depends on the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, which is affected by multiple factors, including body temperature, PaCO_2, serum pH, and 2,3-BPG concentration. In patients with anemia due to chronic blood loss, the O_2-Hb dissociation curve is normal or shifted to the right (due to a compensatory increase in 2,3-BPG concentration).",

            "description": "The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve shows the partial pressure of oxygen (pO_2) in blood in relation to the percentage O_2 saturation of hemoglobin (HbO_2), i.e., the binding affinity of Hb for O_2. The curve is sigmoidal (S-shaped), starting with a gradual increase, then rising steeply before plateauing (blue curve).Factors that decrease the affinity of Hb for O_2 (e.g., ↑ pCO_2) shift the curve to the right (green curve). This increases P_50 (the partial pressure of oxygen needed to maintain 50% of Hb saturated). These factors facilitate the release of O_2 to the tissues.Factors that increase the affinity of Hb for O_2 (e.g., ↓ pCO_2) shift the curve to the left (purple curve), with a concomitant decrease in P_50.The variation in the binding affinity of Hb for O_2 represented by the sigmoidal shape of the curve is clinically significant, since it means that a decrease in pO_2 does not lead to a corresponding linear decrease in % HbO_2. Instead, HbO_2 initially drops very slowly, but with further decrease in pO_2 then drops precipitously:\n\n(A) A pO_2 of 90 mmHg corresponds to an HbO_2 saturation of ∼ 97%.\n(B) A decrease of pO_2 to ∼75 mmHg corresponds to a decrease in % HbO_2 of only ∼3% (to 94%).\n(C) A further decrease of pO_2 to 50 mmHg corresponds to a further decrease in % HbO_2 of ∼ 10% (to 84%).",

In a patient with mitral valve incompetence, as seen here, this phenomenon would be expected to decrease the regurgitant fraction (retrograde blood flow) across the mitral valve in the next cardiac cycle. However, this effect of increased LV inotropy is counteracted by the increase in left ventricular systolic pressure, which tends to increase regurgitant blood flow. Overall, increased LV inotropy does not result in a specific or predictable change in the regurgitant volume, as has been shown empirically in studies with dobutamine (an inotropic drug).",

        "explanation_why": "A decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) would reduce the volume of retrograde blood flow through the mitral valve. In mitral regurgitation (MR), the left ventricular ejection fraction is divided between the output through the aortic valve and through the abnormal regurgitant mitral valve. When SVR (left ventricular afterload) is decreased, a greater volume of blood is ejected through the aortic valve and less blood flows in a retrograde direction across the mitral valve (lower regurgitant fraction). This is the rationale for using systemic vasodilators (e.g., sodium nitroprusside) to treat dyspnea in patients with severe acute MR. Conversely, maneuvers such as isometric contraction and a hand grip, which increase SVR, reduce ejection fraction through the aortic valve and increase the retrograde flow.",

In the case of excess exposure to radioactive iodine (e.g., in patients undergoing radioactive iodine ablation or after a nuclear accident), potassium iodide is used to decrease radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, which decreases the risk of radiation thyroiditis and radiation-induced thyroid cancer. When administered immediately after radioactive iodine overdose, nonradioactive iodine in potassium iodide competes with radioactive I^131 and prevents uptake into the thyroid gland. Potassium iodide also inhibits the release of thyroid hormone by preventing the proteolytic cleavage of T3 and T4 from thyroglobulin. Therefore, it can be used as an adjunct therapy in hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm, as well as a pretreatment before thyroid surgery.",

Acute illness and infection are associated with hyperglycemia and worsening glycemic control (due to the release of catecholamines), which often requires increased insulin dosing. Lowering this patient's insulin dosing during a viral infection would be inappropriate because it would place her at risk of uncontrolled hyperglycemia.",

Mealtime insulin is usually dosed just prior to food intake and is proportional to the expected carbohydrate intake.

Higher sensitivity to insulin increases glycolysis and reduces gluconeogenesis.

Although β2 agonism stimulates insulin secretion by the pancreatic β cells, activation of β2 receptors in the liver and skeletal muscle increases glycogenolysis and decreases insulin sensitivity. Overall, these mechanisms result in increased serum glucose. For this reason, hyperglycemia is a common adverse effect of β2 agonists. This patient would need to increase her insulin dose prior to using her albuterol inhaler; lowering the dose would further predispose her to hyperglycemia.",

She has a history of anorexia nervosa and has received dietary and behavioral therapy over the past 6 months with minimal improvement in her symptoms. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 49 kg (104 lb); her BMI is 17 kg/m^2. Physical examination shows pallor and thin, soft, depigmented hair on the arms and back. After an extensive workup, the physician recommends pulsatile GnRH therapy for infertility treatment. At a follow-up examination one week after initiating therapy, a pelvic ultrasound shows a 24-mm hypoechogenic cavity in the right ovary. The patient subsequently receives a drug that results in the resumption of meiosis and the loss of gap junctions between the cumulus granulosa cells and the oocyte. This patient most likely received which of the following drugs at the follow-up examination?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "Anorexia nervosa can cause infertility as a result of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Pulsatile GnRH therapy stimulates endogenous FSH secretion and ovarian follicle maturation. Resumption of meiosis and the loss of gap junctions between the oocyte in the follicle and the cumulus granulosa cells are changes that occur during ovulation.",

At low doses, mifepristone leads to endometrial contraction, which promotes premature detachment of the ovum and results in abortion.

        "explanation_why": "Recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is structurally similar to LH, is commonly used to induce ovulation. After ovarian follicle maturation is achieved with pulsatile GnRH therapy, as seen on this patient's pelvic ultrasound, recombinant hCG can then be administered to induce ovulation as part of assisted reproductive therapy. Recombinant hCG stimulates LH receptors, mimicking the mid-cycle LH surge to stimulate final oocyte maturation and ovulation.\n\nEndogenous hCG, which is normally produced by the placenta after implantation, is used to detect pregnancy and plays no role in ovulation.",

        "explanation_why": "Severe AS can lead to impaired right ventricular contractility via backward failure. Backward failure can cause dyspnea due to the backup of blood into the lungs. The backup of blood in this patient is caused by impaired contractility of the left rather than the right ventricle. Also, this patient has no features of right ventricular dysfunction, such as pitting edema or jugular venous distention. In patients with AS, exacerbation of dyspnea due to AF is caused by a different mechanism.",

AF causes a decreased, not increased, myocardial perfusion pressure gradient as a result of uncoordinated atrial contraction (which impairs diastolic filling of the left ventricle) and tachycardia (which shortens the duration of diastole). In addition, this patient has AS, which often causes left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy further compromises the myocardial perfusion pressure gradient by impeding diastolic filling.",

        "explanation_why": "AS causes increased left ventricular afterload and end-systolic volume, which results in an increase in filling pressures and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Because left ventricular hypertrophy commonly results in diastolic dysfunction, individuals with AS rely on the contraction of the left atrium for ventricular filling. The increase in diastolic filling pressure can, in turn, cause left atrial dilatation, which increases the risk of AF. AF decreases left ventricular preload as a result of uncoordinated atrial contraction (which impairs diastolic filling of the left ventricle) and tachycardia (which shortens the duration of diastole and reduces ventricular filling time). If AF develops in individuals with severe AS, it can exacerbate symptoms of angina and dyspnea due to pulmonary edema, which is likely responsible for this patient's worsening shortness of breath.",

The murmur due to an ASD would be a systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper (not lower!) left sternal border and it would be associated with a fixed split in S_2, unlike this patient with a normal inspiratory split of S_2.

Oxygenated blood from the left ventricle re-enters the pulmonary system, increasing pulmonary artery and right ventricular pressure, which leads to hypertrophy in those two areas. The irreversible thickening and narrowing of the pulmonic vasculature cause pulmonary hypertension. In the late stage of the disease, due to irreversible pulmonary hypertension, the right ventricle pressure increases until it exceeds the left ventricular pressure, causing a shunt reversal (Eisenmenger reaction).",

This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

However, murmurs due to mitral valve disease are best heard at the cardiac apex, not at the left lower sternal border, and this child has no features to suggest rheumatic fever (e.g., fever, history of recent pharyngitis).

Inflammatory mediators lead to systemic vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, both of which decrease the effective circulating volume. This subsequently results in low left ventricular end-diastolic volume and decreased PCWP. In the later stages of shock, the heart can no longer compensate; cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen content begin to fall, resulting in combined shock (e.g., distributive shock and cardiogenic shock). However, patients with this set of hemodynamic parameters would be critically ill and present with abnormal vital parameters such as hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, and fever or hypothermia, none of which is seen here.",

        "explanation_why": "In left heart failure, poor contractility leads to decreased stroke volume and decreased cardiac output. Because the low cardiac output does not allow oxygen demand in peripheral tissues to be met, a higher proportion of oxygen than normal is extracted from the blood, resulting in a lower mixed venous oxygen content. With increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume and poor forward flow, left ventricular pressure increases and is transmitted to the left atrium, resulting in increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Decreased cardiac output also results in activation of RAAS and the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased peripheral vascular resistance and enhanced sodium and water retention. Although these changes compensate for low cardiac output initially, persistent neurohumoral activation further promotes sodium and water retention, cardiac dysfunction, and myocyte hypertrophy.",

In obstructive shock, venous return remains the same but cannot be transmitted through the heart chambers effectively. This results in decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume and cardiac output. Decreased cardiac output and effective circulating volume activate the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system, resulting in increased peripheral vascular resistance. In addition, low cardiac output leads to decreased mixed venous oxygen content. Depending on the extent of obstruction, PCWP may be decreased or unchanged. Patients with obstructive shock are most often hypotensive with compensatory tachycardia, neither of which is seen this patient.",

In the nucleus, glucocorticoids inactivate the transcription factor NF-κB, which normally induces the production of inflammatory agents (e.g., TNF-α).

Leukotrienes are involved in airway hyperreactivity and bronchoconstriction. Accordingly, blocking leukotriene receptors leads to bronchodilation. Although montelukast relieves airway inflammation, it is not indicated to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This medication is typically used to treat asthma and has been shown to reduce the number of acute asthma attacks.

This patient has a history of tobacco use, presents with chronic productive cough, and has an increased anteroposterior chest diameter with coarse crackles on examination. Together, these features strongly suggest a diagnosis of COPD. Tiotropium (and other long-acting parasympatholytics) competitively binds to muscarinic receptors, which subsequently reduces parasympathetic tone on the bronchioles, blocking bronchoconstriction. These effects reduce the symptoms of airway obstruction and improve pulmonary functionality.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a dimer that consists of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit. While the alpha subunit is identical to that of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), the beta subunit is unique to hCG. Pregnancy tests function by detecting the unique beta subunit in the urine or blood. Levels of hCG peak in the first trimester of pregnancy.",

        "explanation_why": "In women who are not pregnant, the corpus luteum degenerates approximately 10 days after ovulation and the subsequent fall in progesterone is responsible for the shedding of uterine endometrium during menstruation. If fertilization and implantation occur, hCG, which is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts, maintains the corpus luteum for at least another 6 weeks in order to prevent expulsion of the products of conception. After this period, progesterone production by the placenta reaches high enough levels that the uterine endometrium is no longer dependent on the progesterone produced by the corpus luteum (luteal-placental shift).\n\nOther functions of hCG during pregnancy include stimulation of the maternal thyroid to produce thyroid hormone, stimulation of adrenal and placental steroidogenesis, secretion of relaxin from the corpus luteum, stimulation of Leydig cells of the male fetal testis to produce testosterone, and prevention of immunological rejection of the fetus.",

            "description": "The menstrual cycle consists of two phases: the follicular and the luteal phase. The onset of menses marks the beginning of the follicular phase, which usually lasts 12–14 days but may be variable. The luteal phase begins on the day of ovulation and lasts 14 days.During the follicular phase, FSH and LH stimulate the development of several follicles, one of which develops as the dominant follicle into the Graafian follicle. An LH surge initiates ovulation. As the oocyte reaches the fallopian tube, the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. If no pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum regresses and the progesterone level drops. This drop induces vasospasms in the uterine spiral arteries, ischemia, and sloughing off of the functional endometrial layer, which leads to menstrual bleeding (menstrual phase). During the proliferative phase, the endometrium is built up again in preparation for oocyte implantation during the secretory phase.1: stages of follicle development; 2: hormone levels; 3: phases of the endometrial cycle; 4: development of the endometrium during the cycle",

The direct effect of hCG in an individual who is not pregnant is the induction of ovulation (similar to the action of LH). In fact, hCG was used in the past to induce ovulation in patients being treated for infertility. However, the use of hCG is associated with a significant risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and safer GnRH agonists are now preferred.",

Chest wall compliance typically decreases because of increased chest wall stiffness. Stiffening of the chest wall and loss of elastic recoil impair lung emptying during expiration, which results in increased residual volume. When compared to a healthy young adult, individuals of advanced age have increased alveolar dead space and V/Q mismatch due to age-related loss of lung surface area. Moreover, while aging classically leads to a decrease in FEV_1  and vital capacity, total lung capacity usually remains unchanged.\n\nOther age-related changes include decreased respiratory muscle strength (which can hinder effective coughing and increase the risk of aspiration and infection) and impaired ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.",

He reports that it takes longer for his penis to become erect, and he cannot maintain an erection for as long as before. His ejaculations have become less forceful. Once he has achieved an orgasm, he requires several hours before he can have another orgasm. He has been happily married for 40 years and he has no marital conflicts. His only medication is esomeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Examination shows coarse dark pubic and axillary hair. The skin of his lower extremity is warm to the touch; pedal pulses and sensation are intact. Rectal examination shows a symmetrically enlarged prostate with no masses. His fasting serum glucose is 96 mg/dL and his prostate-specific antigen is 3.9 ng/mL (N < 4). Which of the following etiologies is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous labetalol, an adrenergic blocker with nonselective beta antagonism (β1 and β2 receptors) and alpha-1 antagonism, is used to treat severe gestational hypertension and hypertensive emergencies. Alpha-1 blockade causes peripheral vasodilation, which decreases blood pressure. Beta-1 receptor blockade decreases cardiac contractility and renin secretion, which further lowers blood pressure. In addition, beta-1 blockade decreases heart rate by causing sinoatrial and AV node depression.\n\nCarvedilol and the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker diltiazem can cause a similar decrease in both blood pressure and heart rate.

        "explanation_why": "Decreased serum Mg^2+ concentration can occur with conditions that cause steatorrhea (Mg^2+ ions in the intestinal lumen combine with fatty acids to form insoluble soaps, which are excreted with the stool) or chronic diarrhea. This patient has acute watery diarrhea, which does not usually have a significant impact on serum Mg^2+ concentration. Moreover, in acidemic states, there is an increase in serum H^+ concentration, which decreases the binding of negatively charged proteins in serum (e.g., albumin) to positively charged ions, such as Mg^2+, resulting in increased free magnesium levels.",

If sodium intake is concurrently decreased, this scenario can result in hypoosmolar hyponatremia.

        "explanation_why": "In a patient with acidemia, increased arterial pCO_2 would be expected if the patient has respiratory acidosis. This patient's presentation does not suggest a cause of respiratory acidosis (e.g., obstructive lung disease, overdose with medications that cause respiratory depression). In metabolic acidosis, respiratory compensation occurs via hyperventilation (which explains this patient's increased respiratory rate) leading to CO_2 washout and a decrease in arterial pCO_2.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Severe diarrhea typically causes metabolic acidosis through a loss of HCO_3^- ions with the stool. Physiologically, HCO_3^- ions are secreted into the small intestine to neutralize acidic chyme and are later reabsorbed in the form of organic anion salts in the enterohepatic circulation. In patients with diarrhea, reabsorption is decreased due to increased motility of the intestines (decreased colon transit time) while secretion remains constant. Serum HCO_3^- concentrations subsequently decrease, which causes an increase in serum Cl^- concentrations (hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis) in order to maintain blood electroneutrality.\n\nAcute, severe watery diarrhea is also associated with a significant loss of K^+ ions through the stool. At the same time, acidosis can cause hyperkalemia through a shift of K^+ ions into the extracellular space in exchange for H^+ ions, which are buffered intracellularly. The net balance of serum K^+ concentrations in patients with metabolic acidosis and diarrhea is difficult to predict, but most commonly, serum K^+ concentrations are decreased.

        "explanation_why": "Decreased serum Cl^- concentrations, in association with metabolic alkalosis, can occur in the setting of severe vomiting. However, this patient has a metabolic acidosis from diarrhea, which is typically associated with increased serum Cl^- concentrations. When anions are lost through the stool and serum concentrations decrease, Cl^- ions shift into the extracellular space in order to maintain net blood electroneutrality. In addition, volume contraction and Cl^- retention by the kidney in the setting of dehydration further contribute to an increased serum Cl^- concentration.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased resting energy expenditure is a typical finding in patients one week after severe thermal injury. Severe burns, as seen in this patient, lead to a hypermetabolic state, which provides energy to the cells involved in wound healing and counters the significant heat and water loss that results from the loss of insulating cutaneous tissue. This postburn hypermetabolic response is characterized by two distinct phases. During the first phase (called the “Ebb phase,” up to 48 hours postburn), cardiac output and metabolism are decreased. The second phase (called the “flow phase”) is characterized by an increase in stress-induced hormones (e.g., catecholamines, glucocorticoids) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α), which lead to a gradual increase in metabolism, cardiac output, and body temperature until reaching a plateau (around one week postburn). Consequences of the hypermetabolic response include hyperglycemia, peripheral insulin resistance, increased muscle protein degradation, increased lipolysis, and significant weight loss.\n\nPostburn hypermetabolism can last up to 2–3 years and is associated with poor long-term results (e.g., immune dysfunction and infections, delayed wound healing). Therapeutic strategies to alter this response include early excision of necrotic tissue and skin grafting, thermoregulation, early enteral feeding with a high-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, glycemic control, beta blockers, anabolic steroids, pain management, and supportive psychotherapy.",

        "explanation_why": "Serum hCG levels are first detectable at 2 to 3 weeks of gestation; more precisely, 6–9 days after conception when the blastocyst implants and the syncytiotrophoblast begins secreting hCG. Initially, serum hCG levels increase exponentially, doubling every 2.5 days, until they slow down, peak at week 8–10 of gestation, and then decline to reach a plateau at around week 20 of gestation. hCG is structurally similar to luteinizing hormone (identical α subunit) and maintains the corpus luteum, which accounts for increasing progesterone and estrogen levels during the first weeks of pregnancy. Progesterone and estrogen are essential for the physiologic changes during pregnancy (e.g., transformation of the endometrium, prevention of menstruation, proliferation of mammary glands), and serum levels constantly increase throughout pregnancy (graphs D and E). When hCG levels peak and decline, placental tissue accounts for the production of progesterone and estrogen, and the corpus luteum degenerates.",

She had difficulty conceiving for 2 years and in vitro fertilization was successfully attempted 4 months ago. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination shows a tender right adnexal mass and a gravid uterus consistent in size with a 15-week gestation. The fetal heart rate is 160/min. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound with Doppler shows a 3-cm cyst in the right ovary consistent with a corpus luteum cyst and absent arterial flow to the right ovary. The patient undergoes emergency exploratory laparoscopy, which discloses a necrotic right ovary. Right oophorectomy is performed. Fetal monitoring shows a reassuring heart rate. The patient is concerned about the effects of this procedure on her pregnancy and her fetus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's pregnancy?",

        "explanation_why": "During the first trimester, the corpus luteum produces the progesterone needed to maintain the pregnancy, and, therefore, progesterone supplementation is essential in patients who undergo removal of the corpus luteum (via oophorectomy) before 10 weeks' gestation. From 10–12 weeks' gestation onward, the placenta produces sufficient progesterone to maintain the pregnancy and the corpus luteum regresses. Thus, during the second and third trimesters, neither unilateral nor bilateral oophorectomy will significantly decrease progesterone levels. Therefore, this patient should be reassured about the viability of her pregnancy and should receive standard surgical follow-up and routine prenatal care.\n\nCorpus luteum cysts are common during pregnancy and usually resolve by the end of the first trimester.",
