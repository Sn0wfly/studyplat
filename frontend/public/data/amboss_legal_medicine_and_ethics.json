    "question_text": "A 68-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination, accompanied by his daughter. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, for which he underwent radiation therapy. He moved to the area 1 month ago to be closer to his daughter but continues to live independently. He was recently diagnosed with osteoblastic metastases to the spine and is scheduled to initiate therapy next week. In private, the patient’s daughter says that he has been losing weight and wetting the bed, and she tearfully asks the physician if his prostate cancer has returned. She says that her father has not spoken with her about his health recently. The patient has previously expressed to the physician that he does not want his family members to know about his condition because they “would worry too much.” Which of the following initial statements by the physician is most appropriate?",

In some situations, healthcare providers are legally required to disclose information (e.g., for specific law enforcement purposes, threats to health and safety, and situations of abuse, neglect, and/or domestic violence). In all cases of permitted information disclosure, the HIPAA requires healthcare providers to limit the release of information to the minimum amount necessary.",

She recently emigrated from Brazil and is accompanied by her adult daughter, who sometimes interprets for her because the patient has only elementary proficiency in English. The patient's medical history is unknown. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right ankle shows swelling, tenderness to palpation, and a restricted range of movement. The patient is not able to bear any weight on the affected leg. Pulses and sensation are intact over the right foot. An x-ray of the ankle shows an unstable fibular fracture at the level of the syndesmosis. The attending physician decides to admit the patient for surgical treatment and wants to discuss the procedure with her. The patient appears anxious and asks many questions regarding the procedure in Portuguese. The physician has basic proficiency in Portuguese after having spent a semester abroad in Portugal. A professional medical interpreter is not available on-site, but a medical student offers to interpret since she was raised bilingually in English and Portuguese. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician to communicate with the patient?",

If in-person interpreter services are inaccessible, remote (e.g., phone or video) interpreter services are acceptable. Approximately 20% of the adult population in the United States speaks a language other than English at home, and federal law requires linguistic services for patients with limited English proficiency.

She has had previous episodes of abdominal pain that lasted for 10–15 minutes and resolved with antacids. She lives with her daughter and grandchildren. She divorced her husband last year. She is alert and oriented. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 134/min, and blood pressure is 101/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is rigid and diffusely tender. Guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Rectal examination shows a collapsed rectum. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun, and a CT scan of the abdomen shows intestinal perforation. The surgeon discusses the need for emergency exploratory laparotomy with the patient, and she agrees to it. Written informed consent is obtained. While in the holding area awaiting transport to the operating room, she calls for the surgeon and informs him that she no longer wants the surgery. He explains the risks of not performing the surgery to her, and she indicates that she understands and is adamant about not proceeding with surgery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Her pulse is 140/min, respirations are 12/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography shows blood in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.6 g/dL and hematocrit is 22%. The surgeon decides to move the patient to the operating room for an emergency explorative laparotomy. Packed red blood cell transfusion is ordered prior to surgery. A friend of the patient asks for the transfusion to be held as the patient is a Jehovah's Witness. The patient has no advance directive and there is no documentation showing her refusal of blood transfusions. The patient's husband and children cannot be contacted.

    "question_text": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother 2 days after developing a rash. The mother reports that the redness appeared suddenly about an hour after bathing. Two weeks ago, the patient was diagnosed with a skin infection and was treated with penicillin V. She has been otherwise healthy but has missed several well-child examinations.

        "explanation_why": "This patient presents with sharply delineated erythema on the lower extremities and abdomen with sparing of the buttocks (doughnut pattern) in combination with sharp burn borders and no splash marks, suggesting a scald injury due to forced immersion in hot water. During forced immersion, the victim reflexively flexes their legs, leading to characteristic sparing of flexor surfaces (see “Overview of scalds” table). Additional concerning findings in this scenario include the delayed presentation (seeking medical care 2 days later), missed well-child visits, and the mother's expressed frustration with her child.\n\nChildren who experience physical abuse often present with multiple injuries in different stages of healing. Risk factors for perpetrating child maltreatment include history of experiencing childhood abuse or domestic violence, psychiatric conditions, and socioeconomic factors such as recent job loss and financial hardship. Physicians are legally obligated to report suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services, even if it requires breaking patient-physician confidentiality.",

However, these lesions tend to be raised (wheals) and are intensely itchy. Moreover, wheals associated with most physical urticaria usually disappear within an hour after the stimulus is removed; the persistence of the lesion for two days indicates a different diagnosis.",

SBS has an extremely high mortality rate, with approx. 25% of affected children dying as a result of sustained injuries. Cranial CT scan in patients with SBS often shows additional brain injuries such as chronic subdural hematoma (which would explain this patient's subacute presentation over 2 weeks), subarachnoid bleeding, and/or diffuse punctate parenchymal hemorrhages.",

    "question_text": "An 18-year-old man comes to the physician with his parents for a routine health maintenance examination. He noticed a swelling on his back 7 months ago. He has a history of using intravenous heroin but has not used illicit drugs for the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 2-cm soft, lobulated, mobile swelling on the right side of the upper back. The mass slips away from the fingers when its edges are palpated. Healed track marks are present in the bilateral antecubital fossae. The patient is told that the mass on his back is most likely a lipoma, a benign mass consisting of fat tissue that does not require any further treatment. He is aware of the diagnosis and wants the lipoma removed for cosmetic reasons. Four months ago, he had asked another physician to remove it, but the physician refused to perform the procedure since he did not consider it necessary. The patient is counseled regarding the potential benefits and risks of the excision and that there is a chance of recurrence. His parents ask the physician not to perform the excision. However, the patient insists on undergoing the procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "question_text": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease 5 years ago. The daughter reports that in the past year, her mother has become nonambulatory, can speak only a few intelligible words, and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite and progressive dysphagia, resulting in a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She has been hospitalized three times for aspiration pneumonia, and her diet now consists only of puréed food. She has no advance directives. The daughter says that she does not want her mother to return to the hospital again, but she is concerned about her ability to continue providing care alone. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but well groomed. The patient is oriented only to self. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 0/30, and Functional Assessment Staging Tool scale is 7/7. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B_12 are within the reference ranges. Her serum albumin concentration is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The accepted criteria for this diagnosis are presence of coma (of known cause), absence of a brain-originating motor response (including response to noxious stimuli), cranial nerve areflexia, and apnea. Currently, this patient has only met two of these requirements (coma, absent response to noxious stimuli). The corneal reflex is one of the brainstem reflexes that must be tested (along with the gag reflex, cough reflex, and pupillary light reflex) prior to declaring brain death. If all these reflexes are negative, an apnea test is performed to confirm the diagnosis.",

The symptoms began after the patient woke up one morning, having slept on his side. He is otherwise healthy. He works as a waiter and says that he feels exhausted from working several night shifts per week. He adds that he “can barely keep his eyes open” when looking after their daughter the next day. Since the onset of the pain, he has been unable to work and is fully dependent on his wife, who took on an extra shift to make enough money to pay their monthly bills. The patient appears relaxed but only allows himself to be examined after his wife convinces him. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows 1/5 muscle strength in the right arm. Reflexes are normal. He has no sensation to light touch over the entire right arm and forearm. When a pinprick test is conducted, the patient rapidly withdraws the right arm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He has a history of gout, benign prostate hyperplasia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with allopurinol, tamsulosin, and metformin. Urinalysis shows pyuria, leukocyturia, and WBC casts. Results of blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient is diagnosed with pyelonephritis and admitted for empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 4 days, his symptoms have continued to worsen. He is somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. Temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. He is transferred to the intensive care unit and vasopressor therapy is initiated. The physician informs the patient's wife that her husband has developed urosepsis as a complication of his urinary tract infection and that advanced life support may become necessary. A written advance directive provided by the patient's primary care physician includes a do-not-intubate (DNI) order, which was verbally confirmed by the patient upon admission. There is no medical power of attorney. The patient's wife says she wants full life support in case of cardiorespiratory arrest. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

The patient's wishes should be honored even if family members disagree. This patient's living will includes a DNI order that he confirmed upon admission; therefore, he should not be intubated. Because this patient does not have a DNR order, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other resuscitative measures may be performed if needed. Patients who retain their decision-making capacity may revoke advance directives at any time. If a patient is incapacitated, only a durable medical power of attorney can override an advance directive, living will, DNI, or DNR.\n\nA patient's code status (e.g., the presence of a DNR or DNI) should be confirmed verbally with the patient or their appropriate surrogate and documented at each hospital admission.",

He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

He recently returned from a 6-month medical deployment to Indonesia. He appears tired. Physical examination shows nontender, enlarged, palpable cervical lymph nodes. An x-ray of the chest shows right-sided hilar lymphadenopathy. A sputum smear shows acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is made from PCR testing of the sputum. The patient requests that the physician does not inform anyone of this diagnosis because he is worried about losing his job.

This patient is newly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and poses an infectious risk to the general public. Therefore, disclosure of the diagnosis and other pertinent information (e.g., drug susceptibility testing) to the public health department is necessary. Some local health departments will investigate close contacts for potential referral for evaluation and treatment.",

Legally, however, a physician does not need a patient's consent to consult a specialist if the consultation directly relates to the patient's care.

However, given that this patient has been diagnosed with a condition (active pulmonary tuberculosis) that is immediately relevant to the health and welfare of other people, an exception to patient confidentiality is required.

In practice, however, culture is not a practical means of establishing the diagnosis because growth can take up to 6 weeks. In this patient with a positive acid-fast stain and a positive PCR, the likelihood that he has tuberculosis is > 95%. A different step is more appropriate at this time in this patient.",

However, an ethics consult is more appropriate if there is a conflict between the four core bioethics principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.

If a resolution of the disagreement is not possible, the husband will most likely have the final say as his wife's next of kin.\n\nThe role of PEG placement in patients with dementia is controversial; studies have found no survival benefit or increase in quality of life in patients with advanced dementia who received PEG feeding compared with no tube feeding.",

He has been married to his wife for 5 years. They are sexually active and use condoms inconsistently. After the examination, the patient mentions he had an affair with a female partner several months ago. He is concerned he may have contracted a sexually transmitted infection and requests testing. One week later, the patient tests positive on a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test and an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. The patient is counseled on the test results. He requests that his results not be disclosed to anyone including his wife because he is afraid she will leave him. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Physicians are required by law to report certain transmissible infectious diseases (e.g., HIV) to public health authorities (typically the local and/or state health department), which then reports anonymized information to the CDC. During testing, patients should be informed that HIV is a notifiable disease. Patients diagnosed with HIV should be encouraged to disclose their status to their sexual and/or needle-sharing partners. Many states also have partner notification laws that legally require disclosure of HIV status to exposed third parties, either by the patient, the health department, or the physician. Public health officials provide partner notification services for locating and notifying third parties if the patient declines to do so. Regardless of which method is used, exposed partners should be provided with resources for counseling, testing, and treatment.",

Therefore, scheduling a group meeting is unlikely to be productive. Furthermore, because a physician's right to disclose a patient's HIV status varies by state, notifying the spouse could breach patient confidentiality laws. If a patient declines to disclose their HIV status to their partners, the physician should use confidential partner notification services, which are typically provided by public health authorities.",

This patient is discussing her care with a physician, who is unable to determine legal competence. Moreover, failure to understand or appreciate a specific procedure is not sufficient to consider a patient incompetent. Assessing competence requires more information about a patient's ability to undertake other activities of daily living (e.g., grooming, financial decision-making, mobility), which are not discussed here.",

He has a history of illicit drug use. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, the patient becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone.

Pain contracts may be indicated for patients undergoing narcotic therapy, especially for chronic pain.

It is the physician's responsibility to guard against misuse of prescription drugs while properly assessing and treating the patient's pain. To do so, they must avoid prejudice and cognitive bias. It is therefore appropriate in this case to request further information regarding the patient's drug use, to determine whether he has a history of substance use disorder and/or aberrant drug-related behaviors (e.g., actively receiving narcotic prescriptions from multiple physicians).\n\nOnline federal resources may be of use to determine if a patient has a history of opioid use disorder, or if the patient is actively receiving narcotic prescriptions from multiple physicians.",

Findings suggestive of child maltreatment include signs of physical abuse, such as bruising, multiple fractures at different stages of healing, and scald burns. The presence of symmetrical sharply demarcated bullous lesions on this child's arms is highly suggestive of scald burns as a result of deliberate immersion in hot liquid. Accidental burns, such as spill burns resulting from hot liquid being spilled from a height, most often affect the head and neck in an asymmetrical pattern, unlike the symmetrical pattern seen here.",

He spends most of his time alone in his room because he believes he is being followed by the Secret Service. He was fired from his job 3 months ago after threatening a colleague. He appears suspicious of his surroundings and asks the doctor questions about “the security of the hospital.” The patient exhibits a flat affect. During the physical examination, he tells the doctor that he recently bought a gun and says, “It's for protection. I only bought it to prevent people like my neighbor, who works for the Secret Service, from invading my property.” When asked if he plans to kill his neighbor, he replies, “I don't and I hope I won't have to. He usually tries to enter my house in the mornings, claiming he wants to bring my newspaper.” Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Parenteral administration of antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol) is only appropriate if the patient is highly agitated and uncooperative. This patient, however, is calm and does not require parenteral antipsychotics. Long-term therapy with oral antipsychotics should be considered because the patient most likely has schizophrenia, but the threat of violence and stated access to firearms requires a different initial action by the physician.",

The mere presence or suspicion of a mental health disorder is not a reason to breach confidentiality. The health care provider should formally assess the patient's decision-making capacity (e.g., using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool) before reaching any conclusions. At this time, confidentiality should be breached for a different reason.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Most states have passed “Duty to Protect” laws, which allow a breach of patient confidentiality (by informing third parties as appropriate) or restriction of patient autonomy (through civil commitment) if there is potential for the patient to harm themselves or others. These laws require the health care provider to evaluate aspects such as the identity of the person at risk, imminence and certainty of the harm, and type of harm (e.g., physical harm, death) before making a decision. In this scenario, although the patient has expressed that he does not plan on hurting someone other than in self-defense, it is unclear if he can distinguish benign from hostile actions, and there is a potential threat to the neighbor's life if he brings him the newspaper again.\n\nThis patient should undergo evaluation for schizophrenia and, if the diagnosis is confirmed, receive antipsychotic treatment. Most patients with schizophrenia are treated on an outpatient basis, and it is better to have the patient voluntarily receive care before considering civil commitment. If this patient were to receive outpatient care (voluntarily or through community treatment orders), law enforcement authorities should be informed so that they can warn the person at risk (e.g., the neighbor of the potential risk of going near the patient's house). Law enforcement authorities (e.g., judicial magistrate) should also be notified after involuntary admission.",

When the physician starts to mention possible diagnoses, the patient interrupts her and says that he does not want to know the diagnosis and that she should just do whatever she thinks is right. A biopsy of the skin lesion is performed and histological examination shows clusters of infiltrative melanocytes. Upon repeat questioning, the patient reaffirms his wish to not know the diagnosis.

He remains unresponsive in the emergency department. A focused assessment of the boy with sonography is concerning for multiple organ lacerations and internal bleeding. The physician decides to move the man's son to the operating room for emergency surgical exploration. The father says that he and his son are Jehovah's witnesses and do not want blood transfusions. The physician calls the boy's biological mother who confirms this religious belief. She also asks the physician to wait for her arrival before any other medical decisions are undertaken.

The colleague recently lost his wife to cancer and has been taking care of his four young children. Following the death of his wife, the department chair offered him extended time off but he declined. There have been some recent changes noted in this colleague that have been discussed among the resident physicians, such as missed clinic appointments, two intraoperative errors, and the smell of alcohol on his breath on three different occasions. The resident physician has also seen her senior colleague drink small sips from a bottle of clear liquid. When the senior colleague realized that he had been seen, he quickly put the bottle back into his pocket and told the resident to “mind her own business.” Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician regarding her colleague?",

However, physicians have an ethical duty to report physician impairment to a supervisory entity to protect patients from potential harm (ethical principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence). In addition, there are also legal requirements, especially if impairment is strongly suspected (e.g., if there is reasonable evidence or impairment has been witnessed first-hand).\n\nThis question is designed to test your understanding of the current ethical and legal standards for best medical practice. In a real-life scenario, it might be appropriate to confront a colleague in private before or in addition to reporting them. For the purposes of this multiple choice question, however, a different answer option more fully reflects the most appropriate next step in this situation according to current ethical and legal standards.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The local Physician Health Program (PHP) is the supervisory entity in charge of intervention and rehabilitation regarding physicians with medical impairments. Reporting a colleague who is impaired and/or has a potential substance use disorder to the local PHP is the most appropriate action by the resident, as it is her ethical duty to protect patients from harm. In addition to this ethical duty, there are also legal requirements, especially if impairment is strongly suspected (e.g., if there is reasonable evidence or impairment has been witnessed first-hand). The laws and exact wording vary from state to state and physicians should be familiar with the requirements of their state of practice.\n\nThe PHP is supervised by the state medical board and aims to prevent, detect, and manage disorders that cause physician impairment. After the PHP receives a report, which can be submitted anonymously, a thorough assessment of the potentially impaired physician is performed. If impairment is confirmed, management options are offered; the PHP is not obliged to notify the state medical board about the impaired physician's condition if the physician voluntarily accepts treatment. If the physician refuses treatment, the PHP will report the physician's condition to the state medical board, which may lead to an involuntary referral for treatment and disciplinary action. After treatment, the PHP monitors the physician with regular assessments and/or laboratory tests for 1–5 years depending on the condition underlying the impairment.",

She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received two doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Romantic or sexual relationships with current patients are always unethical regardless of the specialty. Such relationships with a current patient can compromise the physician's objectivity regarding the care of that patient and make patients more vulnerable to exploitation. Romantic or sexual relationships between non-psychiatrist physicians and former patients may be appropriate, provided that ethical standards are met for such a relationship. The American Medical Association's code of medical ethics recommends a span of 1–2 years between the end of a physician-patient relationship and the initiation of a romantic or sexual relationship but such relationships are still inappropriate if the physician remains in a position of influence over the former patient from their previous professional experience. Because psychiatrists are in a special position of influence over their patients, romantic or sexual relationships with current or former patients are always unethical.\n\nShould a physician feel that their actions may be perceived as sexual and/or lead to a romantic relationship with a current patient, the physician should take active measures to avoid unnecessary contact with that patient. The physician should also consider using more direct, close-ended questions and have another health care professional or medical chaperone present during interactions with the patient.",

Abdominal examination shows a palpable bladder that is tender to palpation. A pelvic ultrasound performed by the emergency department resident confirms the diagnosis of acute urinary retention. An attempt to perform transurethral catheterization is unsuccessful. A urology consultation is ordered and the urologist plans to attempt suprapubic catheterization. As the urologist is called to see a different emergency patient, she asks the emergency department resident to obtain informed consent for the procedure. The resident recalls a lecture about the different modes of catheterization, but he has never seen or performed a suprapubic catheterization himself.

Gifts of a very personal or intimate nature (e.g., a family heirloom or an invitation to a dinner date) should also be declined as accepting them could be regarded as transgressing the boundaries of a professional relationship.\n\nThe American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics permits the acceptance of gifts of substantial monetary value by physicians under certain conditions bound to strict recommendations (e.g., gifts that benefit patients, support medical education, etc.).",

Examination of the patient shows mild bruising in the left infraorbital area and a right periorbital hematoma. When asked about her injuries, she quietly states that she fell while walking down the stairwell of her apartment complex. The husband reluctantly leaves the examination room when asked to by the physician. While alone with the physician, the patient admits that her husband is responsible for her injuries. Which of the following immediate responses by the physician is most appropriate?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The initial step in treating patients who report intimate partner violence is to assess the patient's safety and whether they have an emergency plan. This woman acknowledges that her husband is responsible for her injuries; therefore, the physician must ensure that she feels safe leaving the emergency department or the medical premises. The physician should also provide the patient with information about in-house and community resources (e.g., shelters). Risk factors for escalation should be evaluated (e.g., partner being abusive during pregnancy, the individual experiencing violence attempting to leave their partner) and a safety plan should be established with the patient before they leave the premises. This plan typically includes advising the patient to prepare an emergency kit that contains important items (e.g., documents, money), which should be stored outside the home, defining a place to go to in case of an emergency (e.g., a shelter), setting up an alarm signal for contact persons (e.g., neighbors) to call emergency services, and advising the patient to avoid areas of increased risk at home in times of escalating violence (e.g., the kitchen, where knives are stored).\n\nRequirements for reporting intimate partner violence vary; physicians should follow local reporting requirements. In general, the following guidelines apply: Reporting intimate partner violence to law enforcement is appropriate if required by law (e.g., when a weapon is involved) or requested by the patient. If children are involved, reporting to child protective services is often mandatory. Reporting to adult protective services may be required if the patient is an at-risk adult.",

A diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke is made. Over the next three days after admission, the patient’s renal function slowly worsens and hemodialysis is considered. He is not alert and cannot communicate. The neighbor, who has been a close friend for many years, says that the patient has always emphasized he would refuse dialysis or any other life-prolonging measures. He also reports that the patient has no family besides his father, who he has not seen for many years. His wife died 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

Without a legally binding written advance directive (e.g., a living will), it is unknown whether: the patient was informed about the benefits and risks of dialysis; his preference was specific to the particular clinical scenario; the preference was stable over time. Making treatment decisions based on the neighbor's report, therefore, would not be appropriate at this time.",

This patient does not have decision-making capacity and there is no written advance directive to guide treatment. Therefore, a surrogate decision-maker is required to act on this patient's behalf in an effort to represent his best interests.

His friends also say that the patient usually drinks at least two beers every night and more than that on the weekends. The patient is aggressive and restless. Examination shows tenderness to palpation and swelling of his right lower leg. An x-ray of the right leg shows a lower tibial shaft fracture. The physician recommends overnight observation and surgery the following morning. The patient refuses the suggested treatment because he is convinced that his leg is not fractured.

If a patient's decision-making capacity is temporarily impaired (e.g., because of alcohol intoxication) and their condition is not life-threatening but requires hospitalization, admission and reassessment of the decision when the impairment has subsided are necessary.\n\nIn patients with full decision-making capacity, an informed decision must generally be respected.

The use of opioid analgesics is appropriate for this patient with worsening pain. Many patients on hospice care use long-acting opioid analgesics, which are associated with a higher risk of developing respiratory depression compared to short-acting formulations.",

She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump and scheduled doses of intravenous hydromorphone. The on-duty physician increases the dose of the scheduled intravenous hydromorphone and then signs out to the covering physician, letting the covering physician know the names of his patients, their locations, and the reasons for their admissions. Overnight, the patient continues to report uncontrolled pain. The covering physician decides to get some sleep in case he has a busy night. He is awoken during the night by one of the nurses, who informs him about the patient's pain. The covering physician orders a one-time dose of intravenous hydromorphone. Shortly after the ward nurse administers the dose, the patient becomes confused, and her respirations decrease to 10/min. Physical examination shows constricted pupils and decreased bowel sounds. An iatrogenic opioid overdose is suspected. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this medical error?",

As a result, the patient received an inappropriate dose of additional intravenous hydromorphone, which led to an iatrogenic opioid overdose. Standardized handoffs (e.g., using checklists) have been shown to reduce the incidence of preventable medical errors. A proper handoff in this scenario should also include information about the patient's current medications (e.g., drug, route, amount, frequency, effectiveness), recent changes to management, and explicit suggestions for anticipated concerns (e.g., what to administer for this patient if she continues to have uncontrolled pain).\n\nIn patient handoffs, it is also important for the on-call physician to receive information on the patient's diagnoses, code status, a summary of the hospital course, and tasks to complete, and for there to be two-way communication between the physicians performing the handoff.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient presents with typical signs and symptoms of opioid overdose, which is consistent with her history of receiving multiple doses of intravenous morphine and hydromorphone. Accidental mix-up of drugs by the nurse is, therefore, unlikely. Moreover, hydromorphone would have been an appropriate choice of therapy had the patient not recently received additional opioids; there is no indication that the covering physician intended for a different drug to be administered.",

The initial response of the on-duty physician to increase the dose of the scheduled intravenous hydromorphone was appropriate for this patient's uncontrolled pain. The one-time dose ordered by the covering physician would also have been appropriate had the patient not recently received additional opioids. This should raise suspicion that the covering physician was lacking updated information about the patient's current medications. The covering physician deciding to get some sleep in case he has a busy night is inconsistent with his decision-making being negatively affected by an excessive workload.",

The abdomen is soft, and bowel sounds are normal. Rectal examination shows bright red blood. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8000/mm^3, and platelet count is 305,000/mm^3. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun, blood is sent for type and crossmatch, and a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells is planned. She is admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of diverticular bleeding and a gastroenterology consult is requested. To facilitate claims payment, a person with a verified health plan identification number from the patient's health insurance company contacts the physician supervising the patient's care and asks, “How long do you think this patient will be in the hospital?” The patient records include a note by the gastroenterologist that the patient should remain in the hospital for at least 3 days.

        "explanation_why": "HIPAA requires covered entities to preserve HIPAA-related information (e.g., patient authorization for disclosure, logs of access by covered entities to electronic PHI) for a minimum of 6 years but does not stipulate a period for which PHI needs to be preserved. After the last contact with a patient, state laws specify a period (ranging from 5 to 30 years) that must be observed before the patient's PHI can be destroyed. HIPAA allows covered entities to hire vendors or third-party business associates to destroy electronic or paper-based PHI (e.g., by burning, shredding, magnetization) as well as dispose of the remains outside the hospital as long as the covered entity has a contractual agreement with the third party in which the third party is required to follow HIPAA provisions.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Covered entities should only access or transmit electronic protected health information (ePHI) from a system that has technical safeguards to generate audit trails (i.e., access logs to identify all individuals who interact with ePHI) and prevent unauthorized access (e.g., password protection, automatic logoffs, encryption, secure networks). The transmission of PHI to or from a health care provider's personal electronic mail is a severe violation of the HIPAA Security Rule and may even result in the health care provider being charged with data theft because it leaves the PHI vulnerable to third parties. Other examples of HIPAA Security Rule violations include downloading PHI on an unauthorized device and leaving PHI in a place accessible to third parties. These violations are likely to occur when health care providers interact with PHI in an unsecured system (e.g., at home to complete patient notes, at a workstation that is accessible to patients, discussing care with a colleague over texting applications). The HIPAA Security Rule also requires covered entities to implement administrative safeguards (e.g., training personnel about HIPAA provisions) and physical safeguards (e.g., locking cabinets or data servers with PHI, privacy filters for computer screens) to ensure that PHI is generated, stored, accessed, and transmitted securely.\n\nViolations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule include releasing PHI without patient authorization, after the expiry of the authorization time limit, or to unauthorized individuals (e.g., health care providers not involved in the patient's care). The exceptions to the requirement for patient authorization include disclosures for treatment, payment (e.g., claim reimbursement), and health care operations as well as disclosures mandated by law (e.g., notifiable diseases, elder or child abuse, organ or body donation). In these cases, the degree of disclosure must be limited based on the minimum necessary standard.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits covered entities the incidental disclosure of PHI under the condition that reasonable safeguards and minimum necessary standards are applied. This means that physicians may call out a patient's name in the waiting room or use patient sign-in sheets, even though other patients might accidentally overhear or see the patient's identity, as long as the information disclosed is appropriately limited and information not relevant to identification of the patient (e.g., the medical reason for the patient's visit) is kept confidential.",

However, under HIPAA there are exceptions to the requirement for patient authorization, including disclosure to health insurance providers for payment (e.g., billing, claim reimbursement). In such cases, the disclosure must be limited to the minimum amount necessary to perform the requested task (minimum necessary standard).",

Three weeks ago, an abdominal CT scan showed ovarian metastases surrounding her superior rectum. At the time, she declined a proximal colostomy and provided a written advance directive that designated medical power of attorney to her eldest daughter in the event that she lacked the capacity to make medical decisions. Today, an abdominal x-ray shows a large bowel obstruction. The patient appears lethargic and thin. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She expresses that she does not want to receive any lifesaving procedures. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of her decision. The patient's eldest daughter, who is in the emergency department, says that she wants her mother to receive all necessary measures to stay alive. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

This patient has demonstrated that she has decision-making capacity, and therefore her wishes should be followed. The surrogate health care decision-maker is only permitted to make a decision on the patient's behalf if the patient's decision-making capacity is compromised. Moreover, the patient's current decision is consistent with her decision not to undergo a colostomy 3 weeks prior. Therefore, no lifesaving measures should be undertaken. In this case, management should focus on comfort measures such as pain control and consideration of a colonic stent.",

    "question_text": "A 71-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-hour history of chest pain and shortness of breath. On arrival, she is disoriented but responsive. Six months ago, she received 3 stents for severe coronary heart disease. She reports that she lives alone and has little contact with her family. The admitting physician asks the patient if she has an advance directive and preferences for potential end-of-life care. The patient retrieves a living will from her purse that is consistent with her verbal confirmation that she does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, breathing tube placement, or defibrillation. Two days later, the patient's condition worsens, and she becomes unresponsive. The same day, the patient's neighbor comes to the hospital saying that he is a long-term friend of the patient and just heard that she was admitted to the hospital. He says that the patient's first grandchild was born 3 weeks ago. “She does not get along well with her own children, but it would mean the world to her to know that she has become a grandma. I know she would feel differently about receiving life support now that she has a grandchild.” Which of the following actions would be most appropriate if the patient needed life support?",

In this case, there is no mention of a durable medical power of attorney, and the patient's most recent wish to not receive life support was expressed verbally to the physician.

In this case, this patient has a living will available and also verbally confirmed her wishes to the physician (her verbal statement would count even in the absence of a living will).

The patient says that his girlfriend knows about his symptoms, but he does not want his parents to be notified of his sexual activity or his positive test for a sexually transmitted infection because they do not approve of premarital sex. He adds that he wants to avoid any further conflicts with his mother, as they have been fighting recently. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

    "question_text": "A 26-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after he was involved in a high-speed motorcycle collision. On arrival, he is unresponsive to painful stimuli. Physical examination shows fixed and bilaterally dilated pupils and an open head wound with visible brain matter in the left occipital region. After transfer to the neurocritical care unit, two full neurological examinations and an apnea test are performed, and brainstem reflexes are absent. The patient is declared brain dead. The attending neurosurgeon speaks to the family and explains the meaning of brain death and that the patient will not recover. His family members say they are hopeful because the patient still moves his fingers when they speak to him or touch his hand. Despite a thorough explanation by the physician that the movements do not indicate brain function, the family believes the patient will recover. Life support is continued while the health care team and the family attempt to reach an agreement. After further argument, the family threatens legal action and says they will physically prevent staff from withdrawing life support, if necessary. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

Recommendations also emphasize an empathetic approach that meets the family's emotional needs and tries to reach a mutual understanding.\n\nAlthough it is medically appropriate to discontinue life-supporting measures after brain death, and the physician is not obligated to obtain the family’s permission, life support may be continued briefly to allow the family time to visit the patient and come to terms with the diagnosis. If disagreement persists despite these accommodations, further steps (e.g., consulting the ethics committee) may be necessary.",

She is currently treating many patients with inflammatory bowel disease who would benefit greatly from this new treatment. After the study is published, the physician receives a letter from the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the medication. The company offers her sponsorship of travel, lodging, and registration to present her research at an important international conference on inflammatory bowel disease. The company also offers her funding for a phase III trial with the new drug at the hospital where she is currently working. The company reserves the right to withhold the publication of the physician's research findings after the trial. The physician is very interested in both the drug trial and the conference, where many potential collaborators would be present that could help assist in her research. Which of the following is the most appropriate response from the attending physician?",

        "explanation_why": "The American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics states that a physician can accept a gift from industry only if it assists the physician's work and benefits patients. The value of any such gift should not be substantial; pens, notepads, and medical textbooks are examples of acceptable gifts. Consequently, the AMA states that a physician should not accept subsidies from industry for the purpose of underwriting the cost of continuing medical education conferences or professional meetings (e.g., travel, lodging, and registration). Moreover, a pharmaceutical company cannot invite a physician to present at a medical conference. Instead, the institution organizing the conference or meeting may accept commercial support (i.e., from the pharmaceutical company) and independently decide the appropriate use of its funds (e.g., content, presenters, fees, reimbursement).\n\nPhysician partnership with pharmaceutical companies has grown exponentially as funding in clinical research activities has expanded. While phase III drug trials are often industry-sponsored, the lead researcher should have complete responsibility for the conduct of the trial, data analysis, and research publication; even unfavorable results from the trial should be reported. The company's stipulations for trial funding jeopardizes the integrity of research. Therefore, the attending physician should not accept the trial funding. Industry-sponsored research is only permissible if there are no conflicts of interest, the institutional review board gives permission, and all sources of funding are duly disclosed.",

However, to avoid any conflict of interest, the training institution (not an attending physician) where trainees are attending medical school or completing their residency or fellowship must independently select the recipients. In addition, financial assistance should not be given directly from the industry to the attendees. Moreover, a licensed physician must lead a drug trial; it would be inappropriate for a senior resident, who has not yet completed training, to lead a drug trial.",

She is scheduled to receive vaccinations against hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. She does not have a fever or a history of serious illness. The physician reviews the recommended immunization schedule with the parents during the visit. They agree to all vaccinations except the one against varicella. When asked about their reason for refusing the varicella vaccine, the father says, “It has nothing to do with the cost. We simply believe that the vaccine is unnecessary. We both had chickenpox as children, and it was no problem. Also, we are homeschooling.” The physician informs the parents of the risks of not vaccinating their daughter against varicella, including the sequelae of chickenpox infection in adults. The parents thank the physician for the information but decline the varicella vaccine for now. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician at this time?",

This can be addressed by documenting the conversation with the parents about the risks and benefits of vaccinating and not vaccinating and the parents' refusal. Physicians should avoid terminating the physician-patient relationship just because parents refuse to vaccinate their child. This decision should be made only if a substantial level of conflict develops and compromises the physician-patient relationship. Also, if the physician terminates the relationship, he or she needs to provide sufficient notice so that another health care provider can be found.",

The topic should then be revisited at the next visit. If the parents still refuse vaccination after further discussion, the physician must respect the decision and most situations do not require that coercive measure be taken (e.g., reporting the refusal to the public health agency, involving state agencies to override the parents' decision on the premise of medical neglect, informing child protective services). Coercive measures are usually only required if there is a significant risk of serious harm to the child and/or to others (e.g., diseases with very high morbidity and mortality, vaccines targeting epidemic disease).",

He has nontremor-dominant Parkinson disease that was diagnosed at the age of 68 after developing progressive bradykinesia and rigidity. He lives alone following the death of his wife 2 years ago. The patient's son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren live nearby and help him with daily activities. Current medications include levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. He appears well. Neurologic examination shows mild hypomimia, bradydiadochokinesia, shortened steps, and mild gait shuffling. During the examination, the patient mentions that he drove himself to his appointment today because he does not want to feel like a burden on his son. The physician is concerned that the patient's illness and medications potentially impair his driving skills. The patient stresses that he has never had an accident in his life and is a very safe driver. He also states that he has felt isolated since his wife's passing and likes to meet up with old friends at a local bar. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "A physician should encourage patients to communicate with their family members and seek help when necessary. However, it is inappropriate for the physician to presume that the patient's son would be willing to drive for the patient. The physician should instead explore the patient's reasons for feeling like a burden on his son, rather than simply instructing him not to feel this way. Moreover, in this case, it is critical to inform the patient that his current condition impairs his ability to drive safely; a different reaction would, therefore, be appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Irrespective of state laws, if a physician believes that a patient cannot drive safely, the physician must share their concerns with the patient and ask them to stop driving until they have been evaluated and treated by a driver rehabilitation specialist. Alternatively, the patient can be recleared for driving by the state licensing authority (e.g., Department of Motor Vehicles). However, the laws for reporting impaired drivers differ between states.\n\nMost states have voluntary reporting laws, under which a physician is not required to disclose a patient's driving impairment to the state licensing authority but are protected from a breach of patient confidentiality if they do so. Some states have mandatory reporting laws, which require physicians to report any patient with driving impairment to the state licensing authority. In states with voluntary or mandatory reporting laws, the physician can be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not report the driving impairment. A few states do not have any reporting laws and require the physician to obtain the patient's consent before disclosing driving impairment to the authorities. In these states, the physician cannot be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not have consent to disclose driver impairment.",

        "explanation_why": "This child shows signs of sexual abuse, for which a well-documented patient interview is often the most important piece of evidence. In over 90% of cases, the perpetrator is an individual known to the child or their family. Therefore, it is important to interview the child separately from the parent to allow for a neutral and honest conversation. Furthermore, girls aged 9–12 years are at increased risk for sexual abuse. Behavioral changes that should raise concern for sexual abuse include sexually acting-out, sexual remarks that are inconsistent with age, problems at school, aggression, regression (e.g., nocturnal enuresis), eating or sleep disturbances, and depression. Medical conditions that should raise concern for sexual abuse include sexually transmitted infections (e.g., condylomata acuminata), pregnancies, recurrent urinary tract infections, and anogenital or oral trauma.\n\nThe threshold for investigating any suspected case of child abuse should be very low. The patient interview is followed by a careful physical examination and screening for STIs. Subsequently, the physician must notify Child Protective Services to protect the safety of the child and to ensure further investigation (including a forensic interview).",

She has a history of mild hypertension. At the previous visit, she was informed of her cancer diagnosis. The physician recommends mastectomy and initiates a conversation about the procedure. When trying to inform the patient about possible complications from the procedure, the patient interrupts the physician and says, “Doctor, I want to continue with surgery. Please don't tell me how things can go wrong or if I will need chemotherapy in the future. I am already anxious, and all the information will overwhelm me.” Which of the following answer options most accurately describes the correct course of action for the physician in this case?",

    "question_text": "A group of investigators designs a small phase 0 trial to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a new drug against pregnancy-induced hypertension. They decide to conduct the study after a renowned journal published the results of an animal trial that showed the drug to be safe and effective in reducing blood pressure in pregnant chimps. No teratogenic effects were reported. The investigators receive a grant from the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug after the company contractually agrees not to influence the design, conduct, analysis, or publication of the trial in any way. The grant funds are designated to be used for expenses incurred in conducting the study. Other than a grant-drawn salary for the predetermined duration of the trial, no financial or material compensation would be offered to the investigators. The investigators propose to recruit a group of ten healthy pregnant women. Both the study participants and the fathers of their children would be informed in their native language, verbally as well as in writing, about the investigators' industry affiliation, the purpose and design of the study, the benefits and known side effects of the new drug, and the alternative options for treating pregnancy-induced hypertension.

    "content_preview": "A group of investigators designs a small phase 0 trial to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a new drug against pregnancy-induced hypertension. They decide to conduct the study after a renowned journal published the results of an animal trial that showed the drug to be safe and effective in reducing blood pressure in pregnant chimps. No teratogenic effects were reported. The investigators receive a grant from the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug after the company contractually agrees not to influence the design, conduct, analysis, or publication of the trial in any way. The grant funds are designated to be used for expenses incurred in conducting the study. Other than a grant-drawn salary for the predetermined duration of the trial, no financial or material compensation would be offered to the investigators. The investigators propose to recruit a group of ten healthy pregnant women. Both the study participants and the fathers of their children would be informed in their native language, verbally as well as in writing, about the investigators' industry affiliation, the purpose and design of the study, the benefits and known side effects of the new drug, and the alternative options for treating pregnancy-induced hypertension. The participants would also be informed of their rights to confidentiality, to withdraw from the trial at any time, to free medical treatment as well as financial compensation in the event of harm to them or their fetus, and to decision-making autonomy regarding termination or continuation of the pregnancy, antenatal care, and medical or surgical treatment.

        "explanation_why": "Vulnerable populations (e.g., pregnant women, neonates, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, economically or educationally disadvantaged individuals) are at increased risk of harm in clinical trials, and certain safeguards for protection of these populations are set in place by the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP). Before including pregnant women in clinical trials, preclinical trials in pregnant animals and clinical trials in nonpregnant individuals must have been conducted, and data regarding potential risks has to be available. Because the proposed trial was preceded only by an animal trial in pregnant chimps, it would most likely be rejected by an institutional review board. In addition to the animal trial, phase 0, I, II, and III clinical trials in nonpregnant women should be conducted to ensure the safety of the new drug.\n\nTwo of the central ethical requirements for clinical trials are voluntary participation and informed consent. The OHRP safeguards aim to ensure that vulnerable populations are not coerced (e.g., prisoners generally cannot be recruited for studies unless the research investigates health issues directly related to the prison population) and that those who may not be fully capable of informed consent are protected by all means (e.g., neonates can only participate in trials for the purpose of obtaining crucial biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by other means or has the potential to provide direct benefit to the neonate without posing any additional risk).",

The information would be provided in the participants' native language in written and spoken form to ensure comprehension and sufficient opportunities for the participants to obtain more information.

However, in the proposed study the company has contractually agreed not to influence the design, conduct, analysis, or publication. Moreover, other than a grant-drawn salary, no financial or material compensation is offered to the investigators, and the duration of the trial is predetermined, excluding any incentives to prolong the duration of the trial for financial reasons.",

Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. CT scan of the head shows a massive intracranial bleed. After a brain death examination and an apnea test, the patient is declared brain dead. The patient has no living will or advance directives regarding organ donation and was legally competent before her death. She is survived by her 17-year-old son, elder brother, and parents. Her son is currently on a camping trip outside the country. The physician informs the local organ procurement organization, and a representative from the organization inquires with the family about donating the deceased's organs. The patient's brother permits organ donation, whereas her parents strongly disagree. The physician and the representative encourage a family meeting, but the family cannot reach an agreement on the patient's most likely wish regarding organ donation. The hospital ethics committee is convened and recommends adhering to the state law in this case. In most states, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management regarding organ donation?",

However, such a meeting has already been arranged, and there are no grounds to assume that a second meeting with a social worker would provide further clarification.

Spouses are most often listed first, followed by adult children, parents, adult siblings, and close friends. Fiancés and nonlegal partners are not considered spouses in most states, and adulthood is typically defined as 18 years of age. In this case, the patient's parents, who are not in favor of organ donation, would serve as this patient's representatives. The organ donation process should therefore be stopped.",

        "explanation_why": "A medication error occurs when the patient receives the wrong drug or the correct drug at an incorrect dose, frequency, and/or via an incorrect route. Physicians should disclose medical errors to patients regardless of the outcome of the error, so disclosure should be the first step even though this patient feels better and only has some drowsiness. Disclosure of medical errors involves clearly stating that an error has occurred, describing the nature of the error, and expressing personal regret or apology. Timely, full disclosure of errors is beneficial for the physician-patient relationship and patient safety.\n\nMedication errors can occur at any of the stages of drug prescription (ordering, transcribing, dispensing, administering). The physician should also report this error via an incident reporting system. If the cause of an error is not immediately known, the physician should inform the patient and maintain contact while investigations carried out. A root-cause analysis should be performed, and appropriate strategies should be implemented to prevent the medication error from recurring (e.g., medication reconciliation at transitions of care, the use of a computerized provider order entry).",

Two months ago, she was enrolled in a randomized, single-blind, active-control equivalence trial involving an experimental combination chemotherapy regimen for AML. At every monthly visit, the study participants undergo chemotherapy along with a clinical evaluation and laboratory workup. The study participants are given prorated compensation following each visit. There is no additional compensation for completing the study. She has completed two of the four planned monthly cycles. On examination today, she appears tired but is in no apparent distress. During the evaluation, she says that she wants to “continue medical treatments” but would like to “withdraw from the study.” In addition to asking her why she wants to withdraw, which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician-investigator concerning the participant's request?",

        "explanation_why": "A participant has a right to withdraw from a clinical trial at any time. The investigator should accept the decision without attempting to influence the participant in any way but may inquire about the reason for withdrawal to identify any potential risks or adverse events. In addition, the investigator should clarify whether the participant wants to withdraw completely (i.e., from all aspects of the study including follow-up) or only partially. Follow-up is important for ensuring the validity of the research and identifying adverse events that could negatively affect other participants. Informed consent on partial participation should be obtained. In the event of complete withdrawal, the participant should not be contacted for further study-related activities, and no additional information should be collected about them. The information collected to date may be kept.",

Specific circumstances, such as a subject's pregnancy or adverse events that affect safety, may require unblinding participants. Investigators may also decide to unblind participants after completion of the trial. However, withdrawal from a study is not an obligatory reason to unblind the participant and another action is more appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "The type of compensation is determined prior to study enrollment and should be uniformly applicable to all participants. Prorated compensation is used for studies involving multiple visits. This compensation model equitably distributes compensation among participants and pays participants a predetermined amount for each procedure and/or visit. With this compensation model, a participant who wishes to withdraw completely from the study should not be denied compensation that they have already earned but should not be offered compensation for the subsequent visits because such an action may go against the principle of justice for the other participants and risks imposing an element of undue influence on the withdrawing participant to remain (either completely or partially) in the study. Another action is necessary before discussing compensation.\n\nRegardless of the type of compensation model used, a study participant may be eligible for additional compensation if they experienced adverse events from the intervention.",

He has also become increasingly irritable and refused to feed for the past few days. She says there have not been other episodes of seizure or history of trauma. The boy's immunizations are up-to-date. He appears lethargic. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. He has a pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There are multiple purple and yellow skin discolorations around his chest and back at the level of the 6^th rib bilaterally. Results of initial laboratory studies are pending. CT scan of the head shows a thin, extraparenchymal, crescent-shaped, heterogeneous lesion that crosses the cranial sutures on the anterolateral aspect of the left hemisphere. In addition to intensive care and neurosurgical consultation, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "An extraparenchymal, crescent-shaped lesion that crosses the cranial sutures is consistent with a subdural hematoma (SDH), which is typically caused by tears in bridging veins due to sudden acceleration and/or deceleration. Without a plausible history, SDH in conjunction with bruises (purple and yellow skin discoloration) around the thorax at the level of the same rib (indicating a firm grip at this region) should raise concerns for shaken baby syndrome (SBS), a form of physical child abuse.",

Children below 2 years of age are prone to developing traumatic brain injury if they are shaken violently because they have a relatively large head, poor neck tone, increased water content of the brain, and flat skull base (which permits the brain to move easily). After stabilizing the patient, a skeletal survey and fundoscopy should be performed in all cases of suspected child abuse in order to evaluate for signs that cannot be detected on physical examination. Findings that support physical child abuse include multiple fractures at different stages of healing, metaphyseal and epiphyseal corner fractures, posterior rib fractures, spiral diaphyseal fractures of long bones (e.g., humerus), retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous hemorrhage. Suspected child abuse warrants an immediate notification of Child Protective Services.",

Since that time, he has been treated with oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. He appears tired but is not in acute distress. Pulse oximetry on oxygen at 1 L/min via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient has mild dyspnea when he speaks but is alert and fully oriented. Auscultation of the lungs discloses fine crackles in the bases of both lungs. The physician recommends increasing the patient's oxygen therapy to 2–3 L/min via nasal cannula. Six hours after the visit, the patient's daughter calls the office and requests a copy of her father's medical records, so she can settle an issue with her father's health insurer. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

He has no history of similar symptoms. He is sexually active with one male partner, who is the same age, and uses condoms inconsistently. He is in his junior year at a local high school and lives with his parents and his older sister. Vital signs are within normal limits. Genitourinary examination shows yellow-green urethral discharge. The testes are symmetrical without tenderness or masses. A diagnosis of gonococcal infection is made. The patient requests treatment. The physician informs the patient that antibiotic therapy will be necessary. He encourages the patient to talk to his parents, but the patient says that he does not wish to inform them about the infection. When the physician asks the patient about his reasons for not wanting to do so, the patient says “They don't even know about my boyfriend and would be extremely angry if they found out. Would you be able to prescribe me antibiotics without informing my parents?” Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Laws regarding consent in adolescent health care differ by state, but all states allow minors to consent to the evaluation and management of addiction and care related to sexual behavior (e.g., STIs, contraception, pregnancy); parental consent is not required. This patient does not want his parents to know that he is sexually active or has an STI. Accordingly, the physician is ethically and legally obliged to keep his medical information confidential from his parents (although minors should, in general, be counseled to have open discussions about health with their parents or legal guardians). However, since Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is a reportable disease, the physician is required to report the case to a public health official. Ideally, all of the patient's sexual partners within the past 60 days should be informed (either by the patient or by the public health official, but not by the physician!), evaluated for gonococcal infection, and treated if positive. Alternatively, the physician could provide expedited partner therapy (EPT), especially if the likelihood of follow-up is low.\n\nIntramuscular injection of ceftriaxone is used both for targeted and empirical therapy for gonococcal infection. If chlamydial coinfection is present or has not been ruled out, oral doxycycline is added. If EPT is required, a single dose of oral cefixime can be administered instead of ceftriaxone. If chlamydial infection is present or has not been excluded in the patient's partner, doxycycline (preferred) or azithromycin should be added.",

This should be done politely and without regard for workplace hierarchy, interpersonal relationships, or the potential of a career setback. A witness who fails to act is also culpable for the consequences of the error. Early medical error reporting can offer a chance for rectification (e.g., replacing nonsterile gloves with sterile gloves) and prevent a near miss (e.g., break of sterile technique) from becoming an adverse event (e.g., catheter-associated urinary tract infection). Patient safety (nonmaleficence) is the foremost priority; a safety culture fosters the reporting of both active errors (as seen here) and latent errors.",

However, reporting the error to the head nurse at this step in the procedure delays the possibility of rectifying the error and increases the risk that a near miss (e.g., break in sterile technique) becomes an adverse event (e.g., catheter-associated urinary tract infection). Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the person who committed the error to report it.

He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Ten years ago, the patient was diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder after the death of his wife. Since then, his mental status has been stable. He lives alone and takes care of all his activities of daily living. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and drinks two glasses of wine daily. His current medication is metformin. Abdominal ultrasonography shows a pancreatic mass. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a suspicious mass in the head of the pancreas that is classified as unresectable. A needle biopsy specimen of the mass confirms a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. When the doctor wants to enter the patient's room to reveal the diagnosis to the patient, he is approached by the son who says, “If it's cancer, please don't tell him.” Which of the following is the most appropriate response from the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Patient autonomy is one of the four core principles of medical ethics. When a patient's family or friends make a request for nondisclosure, it is critical to understand why the request has been made because this will inform physicians of how best to approach disclosure while respecting cultural differences or other concerns. Understanding the motivation behind such requests may also uncover explicit reasons not to tell the patient (e.g., grounds for invoking therapeutic privilege, patient preference to not know the diagnosis). Furthermore, it promotes rapport and a trusting relationship with the family. In most cases, cognitively intact patients should be informed of the diagnosis so that they can make appropriate medical decisions. Practical approaches to disclosing a sensitive diagnosis include understanding the patient's preference and incremental disclosure (SPIKES protocol).",

According to regulations established by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, all subjects enrolled in a study have the right to discontinue their participation at any given time, for any or no reason, without incurring a penalty or loss of benefit which they were entitled to for participating in the study. The investigator cannot obtain any further information without the subject's consent.\n\nIf the study is not subject to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and the subject requests that the data already collected be destroyed, the investigator may honor the subject's requests depending on the protocol set up by the institutional review board. For studies subject to FDA review, the investigator cannot destroy this information or exclude it from analysis. For interventional studies, data regarding adverse events might be important to protect the safety of other research subjects, and the OHRP, therefore, recommends that the investigator clarify with the subject whether they wish to withdraw completely from the trial or only from the primary interventional component. If the subject wishes to withdraw only from the primary interventional component, follow-up data collection can continue after reobtaining the subject's consent.",

He reports severe pelvic pain and difficulty moving his left leg. He has not lost consciousness since the accident and does not have any other symptoms. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 116/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a shorter left lower extremity compared to the right one, pelvic instability on palpation, and an inguinal hematoma. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The results of a FAST scan, imaging of the head and cervical spine, and retrograde urethrography are normal. An x-ray of the pelvis shows a left iliac fracture with symphysis diastasis. The patient is admitted to the hospital and scheduled for surgery. His daughter, who is an orthopedic trauma surgeon at the same hospital, comes to see him before the procedure. The patient asks his daughter to perform the surgery because he considers his daughter to be an “excellent surgeon” and believes that she would “act in his best interests.” Despite counseling by the primary attending orthopedic surgeon and the patient's daughter, the patient insists that his daughter perform the procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the patient's daughter?",

Three years ago, when he was no longer able to perform daily tasks and take care of himself, the patient moved in with his daughter, who is his surrogate decision-maker. Over the past year, he has been treated twice for food poisoning. He takes no medications. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 56 kg (115 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m^2. He appears tired and is oriented only to person. His temperature is 36.3°C (97.3°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/63 mm Hg. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and dry skin and mucous membranes; capillary refill time is 2 seconds. There is a tender, nonblanching, erythematous area over the patient's sacrum with superficial skin loss. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation and increased bowel sounds. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. Neurologic examination shows ankle clonus and an ataxic gait. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 9/30. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.0 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 116 μm^3, and leukocyte count is 13,800/mm^3 (14% eosinophils). Microscopic evaluation of the stool shows multiple eggs of Diphyllobothrium latum. The patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment and further evaluation. The daughter asks if the patient could be treated at home. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

The onset and progression of feeding difficulties is a hallmark of advanced dementia, which has a prognosis similar to other end-of-life conditions such as metastatic cancer and stage IV heart failure (i.e., life expectancy < 6 months); therefore, this patient may be eligible for home hospice care.

In the US, physicians are legally and ethically obligated to report suspected older adult abuse to Adult Protective Services if the patient lives at home or with a relative or to the Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs if the abuse occurred in an institution (e.g., assisted living facility).

He rates his pain as an 8 on a 10 point scale. For the past 2 years, the patient failed to respond to multiple chemotherapy cycles. He was previously independent but now lives with his son and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. His son says that his father's condition “is deteriorating every day” and that he “cannot cope with the stress of taking care of him anymore.” The patient has had progressive loss of mobility and worsening pain for the past 6 months. During this time, he also has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and a 15-kg (33-lb) weight loss. He spends most of the day in bed and cannot tolerate walking without aid. Current medications include acetaminophen, oxycodone, and a fentanyl patch. He appears pale and malnourished. He is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination shows marked tenderness along the spine. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows multiple well-demarcated lesions in both lungs and in several vertebrae. The patient has no living will and says he wants to \"die in peace.\" The physician, son, and the rest of the patient's family agree to start hospice care. Which of the following is the most significant factor that affects eligibility for hospice care in this patient?",

When being asked to wait, she briefly sits down before restlessly pacing the room. The patient's medical history is unknown. She appears agitated. She is alert and oriented to person and place. Temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Initial examination shows dilated pupils that are equal in size and reactive to light. The patient refuses to participate in any further medical examinations. When a nurse attempts to talk to her, she briskly stands up and says to the nurse “I'll kill you if you don't let me speak to a doctor.” The patient remains aggressive despite attempts at deescalation, and she is subsequently physically restrained and chemically sedated with an intramuscular lorazepam injection. In addition to continuous observation of the patient, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "An agitated patient that shows violent behavior and poses an imminent threat to themself or others can be physically restrained and/or chemically sedated if other deescalation methods (e.g., verbal techniques) are unsuccessful. After the patient has calmed down or adequate sedation has been achieved, restraints should be removed immediately. Once the patient is no longer sedated, the physician should then reevaluate the underlying cause of the patient's behavior and decision-making capacity to determine whether she should be admitted or discharged. Admission is appropriate when imminent harm to one's self or others continues and/or if the patient is uncooperative, intoxicated, or demonstrates psychotic behavior. If the patient is no longer combative, the behavior was a result of intoxication, and medical examination finds no abnormalities, discharge is recommended.",

The physician in question has been known for his unorthodox teaching methods. His colleagues describe him as misanthropic and eccentric, but a brilliant diagnostician of rare diseases. One year ago, he had a vascular infarction of his right quadriceps femoris muscle while playing golf, and ever since has a limp and uses a cane to walk. He is recently divorced and does not have any children. Over the past 3 months, the resident has observed the physician secretly taking pills on several occasions. During this period, he has also stopped attending rounds and charting. He often meets his patients at odd hours and has a tendency to be absent for a prolonged duration without telling anyone of his whereabouts or answering his phone, which has led to numerous complaints by his colleagues. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the resident?",

The PHP is supervised by the state medical board and aims to prevent, detect, and manage disorders that cause impairment in physicians. After the PHP receives a report, which can be submitted anonymously, a thorough assessment is performed. If physician impairment is confirmed, management options are offered; the PHP is not obliged to notify the state medical board about the physician's condition if they voluntarily accept treatment. However, if the physician refuses treatment, the PHP will report the physician's condition to the state medical board, which may lead to an involuntary referral for treatment and disciplinary actions. After treatment, the PHP monitors the physician with regular assessments and/or laboratory tests for 1–5 years depending on the underlying condition.",

In this case, only the first two of the four criteria are met (i.e., duty and dereliction of duty).",

        "explanation_why": "This physician has committed an active error (sharp end error) by ordering the drug for the wrong patient. Active errors (sharp end errors) occur at the level of contact between the healthcare provider and aspects of the health care system (e.g., patient, health records), are generally readily apparent, and usually have an immediate impact. Skills-based errors such as a slip (which occurred in this scenario) and a lapse are the most common types of active errors. This class of active errors can be prevented by implementing standardized protocols (e.g., implementing a SAFER checklist), organizational changes that minimize stress and fatigue (e.g., having float staff), and implementing forcing functions that minimize distractions (e.g., computerized provider order entry systems that allow only one electronic health record to be open at a time and medication orders to be entered only in a designated distraction-free zone). Such measures would simultaneously address the underlying latent errors that predispose to active errors.\n\nOther terms that are applicable to describe the physician's action in this scenario are medication error (specifically at the stages of ordering and transcribing), patient identification error, near miss, medical negligence, and a nonreviewable sentinel event. A near miss is an error that exposes the patient to potential harm but does not do so because of either a timely intervention (e.g., the nurse identifies that a doctor's order is for the wrong patient) or luck (as in this case, in which the patient did not experience any adverse effect from ketorolac). Any intervention on a wrong patient is a sentinel event, which necessitates a root cause analysis.\n\nSee \"Overview of medical error types\" table.",

Duplex ultrasonography and CT angiography of the carotid arteries had shown an 80% stenosis on the right and 50% stenosis on the left. A shared decision to perform right-sided carotid endarterectomy was made with consent from the patient's medical power of attorney, and the management plan was documented in the patient records as “CEA right.” The surgical intern meets the patient on the ward on the day of surgery and, using a permanent marker, circles the surgical site and marks “X” on the nonsurgical site. The patient is brought to the operating room and the circulating nurse confirms that all relevant patient documents and findings are available. While the surgical team is scrubbing, the anesthetist asks the patient to verify her surgery site by pointing to it. Regional anesthesia is performed, and the patient is draped. The surgery is subsequently performed without any complications. While filling out the signout checklist after the surgery, the circulating nurse notices that the surgery was performed on the left carotid artery instead of the right. Which of the following actions would most likely have prevented this never event?",

    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "The Universal Protocol should be followed to prevent never events such as wrong-site surgery. This protocol consists of a series of steps based on the human factors engineering strategy of redundancy and standardization and should be performed before invasive medical procedures. In this scenario, the surgeon did not follow the protocol for one of these steps correctly and a subsequent step was missed entirely. If this subsequent step had been performed, it could have reduced the likelihood of the error occurring by acting as an additional safety measure (i.e., a Swiss cheese model).",

Marking may be performed by the attending surgeon after verbal confirmation from the patient, although it is acceptable to delegate to another person who will also be present during the procedure (e.g., the surgical intern in this scenario), or by the patient directly in front of the surgeon, but the site marking protocol should be standardized for each institution.",

        "explanation_why": "The Universal Protocol is a three-step process:\n\n1. preprocedural verification of the patient's identity, the surgical site, and the surgical procedure;\n2. surgical site marking;\n3. performing a time-out.\n\nA surgical time-out is performed in the operating room prior to the procedure to reconfirm the patient's identity, the procedure, and the surgical site. The time-out is typically initiated by a designated member of the team, such as the circulating nurse, and involves all of the team members (e.g., operating room technicians, principal surgeon, medical students) who are participating in the procedure. The whole team is responsible for reviewing all of the relevant information through active communication, and once everyone is in agreement, the time-out should be documented. A successful time-out requires a safety culture, which provides an environment in which health care providers can actively speak up about potential errors.\n\nThe protocol for surgical site marking was also not followed correctly in this scenario. When marking the surgical site, the correct site should be marked by writing the word “YES”, the surgeon's initials, or both using an indelible marker. The incorrect surgical site should not be marked; this includes marking with the word “NO” or an ambiguous visual cue (e.g., an “X” could also be interpreted as an indicator of the correct site).",

Therefore, adhesive tape is not recommended because it can easily be rubbed off or transferred to a different site, which can result in wrong-site surgery.",

At a visit 3 weeks ago, the patient reported severe weight loss and loss of appetite. The physician recommended palliative percutaneous gastrostomy and explained the procedure as well as its benefits and possible complications. At the time, the patient objected to the procedure, stating that he did not wish to undergo any surgical procedures or life-prolonging interventions, including resuscitation. He designated his brother as the medical power of attorney. Current medications include quetiapine, hydromorphone-acetaminophen, and prednisolone. The patient appears cachectic and ill. He is 176 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 51 kg (112 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m^2. He is alert and fully oriented. His vital signs are within normal limits. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. He has a flat affect. He denies auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations. At the current visit, the patient appears to have changed his mind and wishes to undergo the procedure.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Late initiation of prenatal care, missed appointments, medication nonadherence, multiple abortions, injuries of different ages, and frequent visits to the emergency department should raise suspicion for intimate partner violence (IPV), which often becomes more severe during pregnancy and the postpartum period.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Individuals experiencing IPV are at high risk of health impairment (e.g., injury, preterm birth, death) and should be provided with information about in-house and community resources (e.g., shelters). Risk factors for escalation should be evaluated (e.g., partner being abusive during pregnancy, victim attempting to leave their partner) and a safety plan should be established with the patient before they leave the office. This plan typically includes advising the patient to prepare an emergency kit that contains important items (e.g., documents, money), which should be stored outside the home, defining a place to go to in case of an emergency (e.g., a shelter), setting up an alarm signal for contact persons (e.g., neighbors) to call emergency services, and advising the patient to avoid areas of increased risk at home in times of escalating violence (e.g., the kitchen, where knives are stored).\n\nScreening for IPV is recommended in all women of reproductive age. If the partner is present during the patient interview, it is important to first separate the patient from the partner before addressing suspected IPV as confrontation in front of the partner can endanger the patient. Requirements for reporting IPV vary by state. Reporting IPV to law enforcement is mandatory in most states if there is evidence of weapon injury or imminent danger. If there is no such evidence, patient consent is necessary before reporting the case to authorities. If children are involved, reporting to child protective services is often mandatory. If the patient is an at-risk adult, reporting to adult protective services may be required.",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with suspected IPV should generally not be encouraged to leave their partners. Many patients are not ready to leave their partners because of financial or family dependencies, feelings of guilt, or fear of retaliation. Pressuring the patient to leave their partner may weaken the patient-physician relationship. If a patient discloses abuse by a partner, a different action is more appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Reporting abuse to Adult Protective Services is mandatory in most states in cases of abuse of vulnerable adults (e.g., disabled individuals, elderly individuals). In cases of IPV affecting adults who are not considered vulnerable, reporting regulations vary between states. If there is evidence or threat of injury from a weapon, law enforcement must be notified in most states. This patient, however, shows no evidence of injury from a weapon. Furthermore, pregnant women have full decision-making capacity and patient consent is required to report cases like this one if there is no evidence of imminent danger. Another step is more appropriate at this time.",

He was born at term following a vaginal delivery at home. The mother states that, initially, the newborn fed well every 2–3 hours but developed poor feeding and irritability over the past 24 hours. The mother received no prenatal care during her pregnancy. The newborn appears lethargic. He is at the 35^th percentile for length, weight, and head circumference. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and widespread jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. His serum unconjugated bilirubin concentration is 31.5 mg/dL. The physician explains to the parents that the newborn must receive an exchange transfusion and phototherapy. The parents refuse to consent to the treatment and request immediate discharge, stating that they want to try \"natural” treatment options such as ginger tea and sunbathing. Despite counseling about the consequences of not treating the child, the parents do not change their decision. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Although parental consent is usually required before minors (children < 18 years of age in most US states) receive medical care, it does not apply in emergency situations in which there is a legal obligation to treat in order to save a child's life or limb. Since severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia has a very high risk of permanent brain damage and death, it is a life-threatening medical emergency and immediate therapy is necessary. If the medical condition threatens the child's life or limb and the effective treatment can be delayed for a short while (e.g., early-stage cancer), a court order should be obtained if parents refuse the treatment, assuming all other measures to convince the parents have failed. Parental refusal to consent to therapy is legally permitted when there is no risk of serious harm to the minor (e.g., for most vaccination refusals) or when the minor has a terminal condition that does not have any effective treatment (e.g., advanced metastatic cancer, certain high-grade brain tumors).",

Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears tearful and startles when the door to the examination room is slammed shut. She is fully oriented and gives consent to proceed with physical examination and documentation of findings in the presence of a chaperone. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 126/92 mm Hg. Physical examination shows several bruises and abrasions on her upper arms and neck. Pelvic examination shows swelling and erythema of the vulva and vagina. There are multiple abrasions of the labia minora and majora with superficial bleeding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. The physician orders vaginal specimen nucleic acid amplification tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas, and serum testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. The patient receives psychological counseling, and with her consent, the appropriate legal authorities are notified about the incident.

        "explanation_why": "Emergency contraception should be offered to all female patients of reproductive age who have experienced sexual assault. However, the combination of an oral progesterone antagonist (e.g., mifepristone) with a prostaglandin analog (e.g., misoprostol) administered 24–48 hours apart is used for elective abortion rather than emergency contraception. Oral emergency contraception medication (i.e., ulipristal acetate, levonorgestrel, Yuzpe regimen) and intrauterine devices are both effective options for emergency contraception. Although IUDs have the highest reported efficacy in emergency contraception, the insertion of an IUD may increase distress in an individual who has experienced sexual assault.",

Treatment usually includes a three-drug regimen of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and an integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir, dolutegravir). Although two-drug regimens can be considered when there are concerns about cost or potential toxicity, three-drug regimens are more effective and less likely to result in resistance. Additionally, abacavir is not recommended in any PEP regimen because initial screening for the presence of HLA-B*57:01 is required and would therefore delay therapy.",

Because many patients who have experienced sexual assault do not return for a follow-up visit, empiric antibiotic therapy should be given at their initial presentation. Patients who do not receive empiric antibiotic therapy should repeat STI screening 1–2 weeks later because initial results are usually negative in previously uninfected patients. Other recommended interventions at the initial presentation include emergency contraception, HIV postexposure prophylaxis, and hepatitis B postexposure prophylaxis depending on the patient's profile (e.g., immunization status, serum testing results).

    "question_text": "A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance 30 minutes after having fallen from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. Emergency medical technicians arrived at the scene of injury 10 minutes after the fall and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) en route to the hospital. On arrival, he is unconscious and has a Glasgow coma score of 3. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F) and he has nonpalpable pulses with asystole on ECG. CPR is continued and the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest auscultation discloses clear lung fields with bilateral air entry and absent heart sounds. Point of care ultrasound shows visible sliding of the pleura and no cardiac wall motion. There is no evidence of fluid in the pericardium, ventricular dilation, or inferior vena cava collapse. Arterial blood gas analysis on 100% oxygen shows a pH of 7.36 and an oxygen saturation of 99%. Despite continuing CPR for another 20 minutes, the ECG recordings persistently show asystole.

    "content_preview": "A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance 30 minutes after having fallen from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. Emergency medical technicians arrived at the scene of injury 10 minutes after the fall and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) en route to the hospital. On arrival, he is unconscious and has a Glasgow coma score of 3. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F) and he has nonpalpable pulses with asystole on ECG. CPR is continued and the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest auscultation discloses clear lung fields with bilateral air entry and absent heart sounds.

    "hint": "In this patient, reversible causes of posttraumatic cardiac arrest (e.g., tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, exsanguination, asphyxiation) have been excluded. Before making a decision, the attending physician must consider the following scenario-specific features: high-energy trauma, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, late initiation of CPR, a cumulative CPR time > 30 minutes without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or a rhythm change at any point, end-tidal CO_2  < 10 mm Hg, and an examination finding suggestive of brainstem areflexia.",

Performing procedures on newly deceased patients can provide valuable hands-on training for inexperienced health care providers. However, consent from the next of kin is required for each procedure if the deceased's preferences are not known. According to the Uniform Anatomical Gifts Act, in the absence of an advance directive or emergency medical contacts in the patient's records, emergency physicians and medical technicians are allowed to search through the patient's belongings and may share their personal information (e.g., social security number) with authorities to identify them.\n\nIf the next of kin cannot be located within a reasonable time frame, it is ethically inappropriate to use the body of a deceased patient for training purposes, regardless of the degree of invasiveness of the procedure. If consent is obtained, the training procedures should be organized systematically and conducted under close supervision while ensuring a respectful environment for the deceased and their family.",

She has had several jobs over the past 10 years but is currently unemployed and has Medicaid insurance. There is no family history of serious illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The patient explains that she has seen several physicians in the past, but all of them refused to order the requested test for her. She says, “You seem wonderful, unlike my previous physicians. They were all incompetent. I even filed a lawsuit against one of them!” On exploring the patient's fear of cancer and the reasons for her inquiry, she reports that she saw an online direct-to-consumer advertisement about whole-body CT scans. The physician explains when whole-body CT scans are performed and why the test is not indicated in her case. The patient becomes agitated and insists that the physician order the test. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the patient's request?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This response firmly yet politely rejects the patient's request. When evaluating a patient's demand for nonindicated care, physicians need to balance the core ethical principles. The ethical principle of patient autonomy, according to which a physician only assists in making decisions corresponding to the patient's personal values, is overruled in favor of beneficence and nonmaleficence in this directive counseling approach. Since there is no evidence that the possible benefits of whole-body CT scanning of asymptomatic individuals (e.g., to relieve the fear of cancer) outweigh the potential harm (e.g., radiation exposure, potential detection of ill-defined abnormalities requiring follow-up testing and interventions), the physician is acting in the patient's best interest (beneficence) and preventing harm (nonmaleficence). Moreover, denying nonindicated investigations and interventions also helps to ensure more equitable care. Finally, it is important for the physician to emphasize that the test is currently not indicated; it might be indicated in the future.\n\nThe patient's behavior in this scenario resembles splitting, a psychological defense mechanism characteristic of borderline personality disorder. Splitting involves separating experiences or people into all-good and all-bad, such as this patient's negative description of her past physicians. To minimize the effects of splitting, health care providers should collaborate toward common management goals, communicate regularly, and clarify their roles in patient care.",

Also, sending the patient to another physician will not solve the problem.

        "explanation_why": "A suspected violation of medical licensing provisions should always be reported to an appropriate authority. A health care provider (HCP) who witnesses such a violation but fails to report it can be held liable for concealment. Suspected incidents of misconduct or incompetence can be reported initially to an oversight authority within the organization (e.g., department chair, chief medical officer, peer review body) if the HCP under suspicion is within the oversight authority's purview. The incident should be reported to the state medical licensing board (SMLB) if the HCP under suspicion is outside the oversight authority's purview (as in this scenario), the incident continues despite initial reporting, or, for any reason, the incident cannot be reported to an oversight authority. Complaints to the SMLB can be filed by anyone (e.g., patients, HCPs, other SMLBs), and, in some states, anonymously. Following a complaint to the SMLB, the licensee against whom the complaint is made receives a formal notification and is asked to make a statement and provide information to clarify the situation. If required, the SMLB can initiate formal hearings and/or initiate disciplinary actions (board orders).\n\nIn the case of billing fraud, the appropriate investigatory authority of the insurance provider (e.g., CMS office in cases of Medicaid or Medicare fraud) should also be informed. If the alleged misconduct potentially violates any criminal statutes, law enforcement authorities should also be informed. When a violation of a medical licensing provision is suspected to be due to physician impairment, it is appropriate to first inform the local Physician Health Program (PHP), which is supervised by the SMLB and can make recommendations to the SMLB if required.",

        "explanation_why": "Individuals who have been affected from self-referrals or billing fraud should be informed once the incident has been investigated and the misconduct has been confirmed. However, a physician who witnesses the suspected misconduct does not have the right to check the records of patients with whom the physician does not have a patient-physician relationship, since this would be a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Instead, the physician should report the incident to an appropriate body with investigatory authority that can determine whether multiple instances of self-referrals or billing fraud occurred.",

Two months ago, she was diagnosed with cholelithiasis after recurrent episodes of biliary colic. Current medications include oral contraceptives and multivitamins. The physician obtains informed consent only for the cholecystectomy and the patient is brought to the operating room. After induction and anesthesia, the surgeon removes the gallbladder but also finds a 3-cm, ill-defined subcapsular mass in the right lobe of the liver. Results of a frozen section from the lesion are consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma, which will require additional surgery. The patient has no durable medical power of attorney. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

If an incidental finding during surgery does not require immediate action, performing an additional procedure without patient consent is unlawful. In this patient undergoing cholecystectomy, the surgeon incidentally discovers hepatocellular carcinoma that does not currently pose immediate life-threatening harm. Therefore, closing the patient, waking her up, and obtaining consent is the most appropriate next step. In situations in which there is a threat of immediate harm if the patient is not treated, the need for full informed consent is waived. If a patient lacks decision-making capacity (e.g., due to coma), consent for nonemergency procedures should be obtained from the patient's designated medical power of attorney or, if there is no such designated person, a next of kin.",

The on-call surgeon is 30 minutes late and the operating room staff is unable to reach her by telephone to confirm the instruments and materials she requires for the procedure. When she arrives, the scrub technician smells alcohol on the surgeon's breath and then confirms this suspicion with the nurse anesthetist present for the case.

        "explanation_why": "Nonmaleficence is the medical ethical principle of avoiding patient injury or suffering (i.e., “do no harm”). Most decisions in patient care require weighing the principle of nonmaleficence against the principle of beneficence (i.e., acting in the patient's best interest). In this scenario, the patient has an indication for an emergency appendectomy, and surgical management is in his best interest (principle of beneficence). However, the patient is at risk of serious harm due to physician impairment, and this risk cannot be outweighed by the benefits of having the procedure done by an impaired physician. The operating room staff needs to prevent the surgeon from performing the appendectomy and find a substitute surgeon.\n\nIn addition, the Physician Health Program (PHP) should be informed about the incident. The PHP will perform a thorough assessment of the physician and arrange appropriate management and support if an impairment is confirmed. Note that the PHP is not obliged to notify the state medical board if the physician accepts treatment of the impairing condition.",

However, the HCP should not block the exit by standing between the patient and the exit, because this action can be perceived as threatening and lead to escalation of the aggressive behavior.

        "explanation_why": "To ensure personal safety when dealing with an aggressive patient, the HCP should step two arm lengths away and position themselves closer to the exit (so that there is an escape route) without blocking the patient's view or access to the exit. The HCP should then attempt verbal deescalation. Offering comfort measures (e.g., food, water) is an appropriate initial step. During verbal deescalation, only one HCP should talk to the patient; the HCP should remain calm, maintain a neutral expression, respect the patient's personal space, and avoid gestures that can be perceived as threatening (e.g., sudden movement, staring back at the patient, expressing a condescending or commanding attitude). The HCP should acknowledge the patient's feelings, ask what the patient wants, and allow the patient to choose between different acceptable options (e.g., sitting down or lying down); doing so gives the patient a sense of control while also clarifying rules and limits (e.g., informing the patient that violent or abusive behavior will not be accepted). The HCP should listen actively, use short sentences and simple words, seek out points on which they and the patient can agree, and give the patient time to process information and respond.\n\nIf the patient continues to remain aggressive despite attempts at verbal deescalation, it is appropriate to ask the patient to voluntarily take a calming medication orally before considering use of force. The use of force (e.g., physical restraints, involuntary sedation) should only be considered if all other measures fail or if the patient is actively violent. Physical restraints and/or involuntary sedation should not be used as punishment and should be removed as soon as feasible.",

The elements of malpractice (i.e., the 4 Ds) are the duty to properly treat the patient, dereliction of that duty, damage to the patient, and direct cause of damage through medical negligence. Although Physician A neglected the duty to treat his patients, none have been directly damaged. Therefore, he did not commit malpractice and a different term describes his actions.",

In this scenario, physician A leaves the hospital and puts patients at risk through his absence, which violates the principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence. This behavior is never acceptable regardless of whether it results in harm to a patient or incurs legal consequences. Misconduct can also occur outside the established physician-patient relationship and does not always constitute malpractice (e.g., research malfeasance, fraudulent advertising). Other examples of misconduct include bullying, making inappropriate comments and/or sexually harassing colleagues or patients, billing fraud, and receiving gifts from patients or pharmaceutical industry representatives. Colleagues who suspect a physician of misconduct should report their concerns to the state medical board, and, if the misconduct implies any legal liability, to the appropriate legal authorities.",

A statistician performs a sample size calculation. Two hundred men between 30 and 50 years of age with central serous chorioretinopathy need to be recruited and randomized to receive either routine care or meditation training with routine care for 6 months. The primary endpoint of the trial is the decrease in subretinal fluid measured with optical coherence tomography after 2, 4, and 6 months. The study protocol is reviewed and approved by an institutional review board. An ophthalmologist unaffiliated with the research group learns about the planned study from an online registry of clinical trials for participant recruitment. She recommends lowering the inclusion criteria for participants to 25 years of age because she recently read an article on the increasing incidence of serous chorioretinopathy in younger men. The research group agrees and decides to adjust the study protocol accordingly. Before continuing with the recruitment of additional study participants, which of the following is the most appropriate action by the lead physician-investigator?",

He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated and not receiving any paralytic or sedative medications. Temperature is 34.9°C (94.8°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 105/62 mm Hg after intravenous administration of norepinephrine. Neurological examination on admission shows dilated, nonreactive pupils and absent corneal, gag, and cough reflexes. There is no eye movement upon irrigation of the external auditory canal with cold water. A subsequent independent evaluation by another physician is concordant with these findings. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate action at this time?",

Normothermia can be achieved by covering the patient with warming blankets and/or administering warm intravenous fluids. Other causes of impaired brain function, such as poisoning, drug intoxication, electrolyte imbalances, and hypotension as well as conditions that can mimic brain death (e.g., locked-in syndrome) should be ruled out and corrected if possible.

She asks the physician if she could try nydronate because she recently saw an advertisement promoting it as a less expensive drug for treating osteoporosis. She would like to save money on her medication copayments and points out that a month's supply of nydronate costs 20% less than alendronate. While evaluating the literature, the physician finds a randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of nydronate compared to alendronate in individuals over 60 years of age. A total of 320 patients were enrolled and separated randomly into two groups.

Although prescribing an unapproved drug is not illegal, a physician can be liable for medical malpractice if their patient develops side effects.\n\nOff-label use, which is the use of an FDA-approved drug for an unapproved indication, is appropriate if supported by clinical practice guidelines.

However, it is inappropriate to prescribe a drug that is not FDA-approved based on results from a single clinical trial or just because it is cheaper.

Ongoing trials are discontinued when there is evidence of futility, safety concerns, or early evidence of clear benefit. A UAE, especially if it is serious (e.g., myocardial infarction), should result in temporary discontinuation of the clinical trial (even if the risk is not statistically significant on the interim analysis) until the reasons for the event are determined.\n\nIf the adverse event is determined to be related to the trial, it may be necessary to modify the research protocol (e.g., by altering the exclusion or inclusion criteria, changing the dosing, increasing the monitoring frequency) to minimize the risk to participants. Protocol modifications need approval from the institutional review board and often require reconfirming informed consent for ongoing participation.

In the past 6 months, the patient was hospitalized twice because of a urinary tract infection. She has Alzheimer disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic urinary incontinence, for which she has an indwelling urinary catheter. She is bedridden and lives with her daughter, who is her next of kin. Current medications include rivastigmine and metformin. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 89/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is alert and oriented to person and place but not to time. She can name three objects shown by the physician and recalls two after 3 minutes. She makes multiple errors during a serial sevens test. The physician suggests replacing the indwelling urinary catheter with a suprapubic catheter in order to reduce the risk of further urinary tract infections. The physician informs the patient about the procedure as well as the risks and benefits of suprapubic catheter use compared to continued transurethral catheter use. The patient is able to repeat the information in her own words. When asked for her decision, she says “I will keep the current catheter because I do not want to undergo surgery.” Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "question_text": "A 58-year-old woman comes to an orthopedic surgeon after referral from her primary care physician because of a 10-year history of right knee osteoarthritis. She has not been able to walk her dog for the past 6 months because of severe pain that worsens with movement; during the past couple of weeks, she has also had pain without movement at night. Medical history is remarkable for several knee injuries from playing soccer in college. Previous treatment with physical therapy, diclofenac, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections has not provided significant pain relief. She has no other history of serious illness. She is 164 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 74 kg (163 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m^2. Range of motion of the right knee is limited; there is palpable crepitus and moderate swelling. X-ray of the right knee joint shows marked osteophyte formation and irregular joint space narrowing. The surgeon wants to schedule the patient for total knee arthroplasty. She has a health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance plan, and the surgeon is an in-network provider. The patient is concerned about potential out-of-pocket costs for this treatment. Which of the following is the most appropriate administrative action by the orthopedic surgeon?",

        "content": "Defer knee surgery until a request for reimbursement is approved by the HMO",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Prior authorization (PA) is a process used by health insurance companies to evaluate the medical necessity and cost of medications, tests, and treatments in order to approve coverage before they are provided to the patient. Health insurance companies usually require PA for elective and expensive interventions that have lower-cost alternatives (e.g., arthroplasty). PA is obtained to ensure that the health insurance company will cover the requested care, protecting patients from financial liability. If a health care provider is in-network, they are responsible for determining whether an intervention needs PA and for submitting the request form to the health insurance company. Treatment should only be provided after the health insurance company has reviewed and approved the request.",
        "explanation_but": "Many health care providers have called for reforming of the PA process because of its detrimental impact on patient care. PAs are widely considered to be a time-consuming administrative burden that can result in delays in care and adverse clinical outcomes. Submitting requests electronically can help reduce administrative time and speed up the process of obtaining PA.",

Because total knee arthroplasty is an expensive, elective procedure with lower-cost alternatives, coverage by the insurance company is not guaranteed. To avoid placing a financial burden on the patient, another action is preferred. In addition, the treating physician is responsible for submitting a pre-claim review.",

    "question_text": "A 66-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 2-day history of vomiting and abdominal pain that radiates to his back. Medical history is remarkable for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. His medication includes enalapril and tamsulosin. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ketorolac is initiated. One day after admission, the patient becomes restless and insists on leaving the hospital to “run some errands” against the advice of his treating physician. When a resident tries to talk to him, the patient suddenly approaches her and screams, “I need to leave now!” A nearby nurse who heard the screaming calls the rapid response team. The arriving psychiatrist slowly approaches the patient without blocking the exit, introduces herself, and calmly asks why he would like to leave the hospital. The patient begins to shout at the psychiatrist and pulls out his intravenous catheter. The psychiatrist asks the patient to sit down and have a glass of water. The patient does not respond and starts mumbling and banging his head against the wall. The psychiatrist says, “I would also like for you to leave this hospital when it is possible.” The patient abruptly turns and throws one of his slippers at the psychiatrist. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The goal of treatment is to relieve the patient's distress while permitting a safe medical and psychiatric evaluation. In uncooperative patients, parenteral administration is required. If necessary, an intramuscular medication can be used initially to calm the patient and facilitate safe intravenous access. Treatment should be based on the suspected cause and severity of symptoms (e.g., an antipsychotic with a short-acting benzodiazepine for severe agitation). If a patient is cooperative, they should be involved in choosing the medication and administration route (oral medication is preferred).\n\nPhysical restraint is sometimes necessary as a subsequent measure if calming medication and deescalation techniques have been unsuccessful and patients continue to be a danger to themselves or health care providers.",

His medical history is remarkable for hypertension and colorectal carcinoma, for which he underwent right-sided hemicolectomy 7 years ago. His medications are metoprolol and lisinopril. Physical examination shows a soft and reducible mass in the patient's right inguinal region and a well-healed midline scar. The patient is scheduled for an open hernioplasty on the next day. The attending surgeon who will perform the procedure expects no significant complications. A fourth-year medical student who is on rotation in the surgical ward asks if she may scrub in and participate as a second assistant in the procedure. She has sufficient experience in the operating room from previous clerkships. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the attending surgeon?",

If a student wishes to assist in surgery, the attending surgeon should inform the patient about the student's identity and level of training, and the patient must give informed consent for participation. As with any other decision, the patient has the right to refuse student involvement in their care at any time.",

He has been a patient at the physician's practice for several years and is, as usual, accompanied by his single mother. At the end of the visit, the patient's mother says, “Thank you for everything you have done for my son. Would you be interested in going on a lunch date with me next week while my son is away at summer camp?” The physician is not currently in a romantic relationship and is interested in getting to know the mother better.

        "explanation_why": "Third parties often make decisions that affect the patient's health and welfare and are vulnerable to a physician's influence. Initiating a personal relationship with a third party who is close to the patient (e.g., parent, spouse, partner) and plays an integral role in the patient's medical decision-making process is therefore inappropriate as it can compromise treatment (as well as autonomy and patient privacy in patients with decision-making capacity and legal competence). Such relationships can limit the physician's objectivity, exploit the trust of the third party, and negatively affect the patient's well-being, which is why the invitation should be declined.\n\nWhile romantic or sexual relationships between physicians and current patients are always unethical, physicians (excluding psychiatrists) may engage in romantic or sexual relationships with patients if more than 1–2 years have passed since termination of the patient-physician relationship. Psychiatrists are in a special position of influence over their patients and should never engage in such relationships with current or former patients.",

Initially, the patient is reluctant to disclose the mechanism of injury but then admits that it occurred during penetrative sexual intercourse at a swinger party. He says that he heard a cracking sound, which was followed by intense pain and an immediate loss of erection. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hematoma and curving of the penis. He is diagnosed with a penile fracture and undergoes uncomplicated surgical repair. After surgery, the patient asks the physician if they could change the diagnosis in his medical records because he is ashamed that his colleagues may read them. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

    "question_text": "A hospitalized 11-year-old girl with a mitochondrial disease has a 12-hour history of high fever. She was admitted to the pediatrics ward because of a 1-week history of severe vomiting. Since her admission, she has received total parenteral nutrition through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line in her left upper extremity. Yesterday, she was scheduled for PICC removal and transition to nasogastric tube feeding in preparation for discharge home. Her mother had expressed concerns that she would not tolerate the transition. She has had similar episodes of intractable vomiting in the past and underwent an inconclusive upper gastrointestinal study 6 months ago. She was also hospitalized two months ago for vomiting and received an extensive evaluation that turned out to be negative. During the last hospitalization, she had a central line placed and developed bacteremia with E. coli and Klebsiella. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.0°C (102°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 92/52 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Blood cultures are drawn from the PICC and a peripheral venipuncture, and treatment with acetaminophen, two boluses of normal saline, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone are initiated. The results of urinalysis, echocardiography, and CT scan of the chest and abdomen show no abnormalities. Three days after initiating treatment, the patient's blood pressure normalizes. Cultures from the PICC line grow Enterococcus and E. coli, and cultures from the peripheral venipuncture become positive for the same organisms 12 hours later with one-tenth the number of colony-forming units that grew in the PICC line cultures. A review of hospital records from the past month discloses that no other patients with intravascular catheters have developed bacteremia with these organisms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "This child has had two recent CRBSIs with bowel flora. The PICC's upper extremity location and the patient's age make it unlikely that she accidentally soiled the PICC with fecal matter. Iatrogenic contamination of the PICC with bowel flora (e.g., due to inadequate hand hygiene, contamination of parenteral nutrition modules) is also unlikely to be the cause of this patient's CRBSI given the absence of CRBSIs due to bowel flora in other patients at the hospital. This patient's history suggests medical child abuse, also known as factitious disorder by proxy, which involves the exaggeration, falsification, or induction of illness in a child by a caregiver, resulting in the child receiving unnecessary medical care. Some commonly reported examples include contaminating medical equipment or samples, inducing vomiting or diarrhea, injecting poisons or infectious material into a venous line, and suffocating a child to induce apneic episodes. Diagnosis of medical child abuse requires a high level of suspicion. Red flags include an atypical illness course, infections by atypical organisms without a plausible explanation, and clinical deterioration that occurs just before discharge. Having an underlying medical illness does not rule out a diagnosis of medical child abuse, as up to 30% of affected children have a medical condition unrelated to the one being fabricated or induced by the caregiver.\n\nIt is necessary to urgently consult a child abuse specialist, typically through a child protection team within a hospital setting. Confronting the caregiver directly might put the child at risk for further, possibly greater, harm. The specialist will be able to guide the team on the best ways to immediately protect the child. Recommendations may include safety measures such as one-to-one staffing and close monitoring by an experienced provider staying at the bedside, or transferring the patient to the hospital’s pediatric intensive care unit to separate them from their caregiver. The specialist also can assist in reviewing records and reporting to child protective services. Seeking additional records from outside healthcare providers and institutions is important because victims of medical child abuse have often been evaluated at multiple locations. Consultation with psychiatry and legal professionals is also recommended.",

This is her fourth admission in the past year. When she is at home, her 50-year-old daughter and 48-year-old son care for her with the assistance of visiting nurses and home health aides. Respiratory failure occurs during the current hospitalization, requiring intubation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient becomes delirious and develops ventilator-associated pneumonia, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. Ten days after admission, the patient improves and is moved out of the ICU, but she remains persistently delirious despite appropriate interventions and is unable to meaningfully participate in rehabilitation. The patient does not have a designated healthcare proxy. The physician initiates a discussion with the family about the goals of care to inform discharge planning. The daughter wishes to transfer her mother to a skilled nursing facility, but the son disagrees and wants her to be discharged home. Which of the following is the most appropriate remark to continue the discussion with the patient's children?",

A good way to start is by asking family members how they think the patient is doing. This allows the clinician to explore the family’s understanding of the patient’s illness and to identify any disparities in understanding the patient's prognosis that might be the cause of disagreement among family members. Care should be person-centered (i.e., aligned with the patient’s goals) to avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment of symptoms and based on the principle of substituted judgment. However, specific questions about the patient's goals of care should be deferred until the family’s prognostic awareness is assessed, so that clinicians can ensure families have the information they need to engage in shared decision-making regarding the next steps.\n\nDuring advance care planning, it is also important to identify the appropriate legal surrogate decision-maker appointed by the patient. If no one has been appointed, as in this scenario, the physician should help the family assign someone to be a healthcare proxy. These steps can help prevent conflicts in the future. In addition, family members should be assessed for caregiver fatigue and should receive support for that as needed. In this particular case, the clinician should also talk with the family about referral to palliative medicine and explore hospice eligibility for this patient.",

Domestic violence is rarely an isolated event, and it is therefore important to intervene if an individual discloses abuse. In cases of intimate partner violence, healthcare providers can connect the victim to support resources and help them establish a crisis plan. If the adolescent is the perpetrator of domestic violence, the physician must evaluate the risk to other vulnerable family members (e.g., due to sibling violence) and consider treatment of behavioral disorders that are associated with physical aggression (e.g., conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder).

He drinks alcohol socially but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. The patient appears alert and oriented. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 128/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, a reducible, non-tender left inguinal bulge is noted. During the preoperative discussion, the surgeon introduces the medical team, which includes a surgical resident who will assist during the procedure. The resident greets the patient and speaks with a noticeable accent. The patient immediately interrupts, stating, “I don’t want any foreigners involved in my surgery.” The surgeon explains that the resident is a qualified member of the health care team, but the patient insists that the resident be excluded. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the surgeon?",

    "question_text": "A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a high-speed motorcycle collision. He was intubated for airway protection and is admitted to the neurointensive care unit. Past medical history is unremarkable. His driver's license identifies him as an organ donor, and his name appears on the state donor registry. On hospital day 2, two attending physicians independently complete a brain death examination; pupils are fixed and nonreactive, corneal and gag reflexes are absent, and apnea tests confirm absence of respiratory drive. He is not receiving sedatives or paralytics, and he does not have hypothermia. He remains on mechanical ventilation with stable hemodynamics. The hospital has notified the regional organ procurement organization (OPO) per policy. The patient’s father states that the family’s religious beliefs prohibit organ donation and asks the team to “stop this process.” Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He is not receiving sedatives or paralytics, and he does not have hypothermia. He remains on mechanical ventilation with stable hemodynamics. The hospital has notified the regional organ procurement organization (OPO) per policy. The patient’s father states that the family’s religious beliefs prohibit organ donation and asks the team to “stop this process.” Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Clinicians should offer compassionate support and give clear information to the family but are otherwise obligated to follow the patient’s documented wishes.\n\nStandard protocol requires notifying an OPO as soon as a patient is near death with a severe neurological injury and again within 1 hour after brain death.

She has radiographic evidence of early joint erosion but is currently in a low disease activity state and receiving a stable regimen of methotrexate. She is interested in a phase III randomized controlled trial investigating a novel JAK inhibitor. The protocol requires a 4-week washout period during which participants must discontinue all current disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, followed by randomization to either the investigational drug or a placebo monotherapy for 12 weeks. The study cites \"methodological necessity to establish efficacy sensitivity\" as the justification for the placebo arm. The patient understands the risks and is eager to participate because the trial offers free MRI monitoring and travel reimbursement. Which of the following best describes the ethical validity of this study design?",

        "explanation_why": "Ethical clinical research relies on the principle of clinical equipoise, which requires a state of genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community regarding the comparative therapeutic merits of each arm in a trial. In this scenario, there is no clinical equipoise between placebo and the standard of care because disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are known to be effective in preventing irreversible joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis. Withholding this proven therapy during a washout and placebo phase exposes participants to a known risk of permanent morbidity, violating the ethical principle of nonmaleficence. According to guidelines like the Declaration of Helsinki, placebo-controlled trials are only permissible when no proven intervention exists or when withholding treatment presents no risk of serious or irreversible harm. Since joint damage is irreversible, a noninferiority trial (using an active comparator) or add-on design is required.",

She mentions that her workplace recently started offering a voluntary wellness program involving health risk assessments. The program's coordinator asked participants to provide saliva samples for genetic testing that evaluates the risk of common conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. While the coordinator explained that participation was optional and test results would be confidential, the patient became concerned when she later heard rumors that some employees who declined the test were excluded from certain wellness incentives. She asks her physician whether her employer is allowed to request genetic information or require testing as a condition for workplace benefits.

The typical procedure involves sending a formal, written notification via certified mail with a return receipt. This letter should state the termination date, which must provide a reasonable period (typically 30 days, but varies by state) for the patient to secure alternative care. During this notice period, the physician remains obligated to provide essential and emergency care, including medication refills for chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes and hypertension). The letter should also include an offer to forward a copy of the patient's medical records to their new physician upon receiving signed authorization. This structured process ensures continuity of care, fulfills the physician's ethical and legal duties, and formally documents the end of the professional relationship.",
