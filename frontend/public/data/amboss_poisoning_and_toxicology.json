        "explanation_why": "This patient most likely had a hypertensive crisis treated with intravenous sodium nitroprusside. Sodium nitroprusside contains cyanide groups and patients who receive prolonged or high-dose infusions or have kidney disease are at especially high risk of developing cyanide toxicity. Cyanide inhibits the electron transport chain and thereby disables aerobic metabolism, resulting in a switch to anaerobic metabolism that leads to elevated lactate levels and anion gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment of cyanide toxicity consists of 100% oxygen therapy and an antidote for cyanide poisoning (e.g., hydroxocobalamin).\n\nThe flushed skin and bright red retinal veins seen in patients with cyanide toxicity are a result of impaired oxygen utilization and increased venous oxygen saturation.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's pancytopenia was likely caused by the interaction between azathioprine and allopurinol. Azathioprine is metabolized to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which causes immunosuppression at low dosages and is cytostatic at high dosages. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for the degradation of 6-MP. Concomitant administration of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor causes a toxic accumulation of 6-MP resulting in bone marrow suppression. A thorough assessment of potential drug interactions before initiating azathioprine could have prevented the development of pancytopenia in this patient. Coadministration of azathioprine and allopurinol should be avoided. The dose of azathioprine (or any other purine analog) should be reduced if concomitant administration with allopurinol is unavoidable.\n\nAlternatives to azathioprine with less impact on bone marrow, such as cyclosporine, would have been a safer option for this patient.",

Referral to an allergist to determine the causal local anesthetic is appropriate before proceeding with elective surgery.\n\nCross-reactivity between ester group anesthetics and amide group anesthetics is rare; therefore, if an allergy to one group is found, an anesthetic from the other group can be safely administered in future procedures.",
