    "question_text": "A 61-year-old woman with a history of stage IV pancreatic cancer comes to the emergency department with insomnia due to intractable midepigastric pain. The pain had been constant for months but has worsened over the past few weeks despite her taking hydrocodone 10 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg. She has chronic pain and major depressive disorder. In the past month, she has been taking her pain medications with increasing frequency, going from twice a day to four times a day. Her other medications include venlafaxine and eszopiclone. She describes her mood as low without suicidal ideation. She appears fatigued and cachectic. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 128/65 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a mass in the midepigastric region. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

A switch from hydrocodone to a stronger opioid (e.g., hydromorphone) is the appropriate next step according to the WHO analgesic ladder. When converting between opioids (opioid rotation), patients will likely have less tolerance to the new opioid than to their previous opioid (i.e., incomplete cross-tolerance). Therefore, the new opioid should be given at a 25–50% lower dose, then adjusted according to the patient's pain score. Additionally, this patient should continue taking ibuprofen, as nonopioid analgesics should be used at each step of the ladder for effective and balanced pain relief.\n\nSee “Management of pain using WHO analgesic ladder” table.",

Acute pain is initially treated with the strongest analgesic for that intensity of pain and then stepped down. Chronic pain is treated from the bottom up. The original WHO analgesic ladder was unidirectional (escalating) and included only the first 3 steps; other authors have since modified the ladder, by adding the fourth step including interventional procedures (e.g., nerve blocks) for unrelenting pain.",

She has also had nausea without vomiting. She has no appetite despite not having eaten since the surgery and drinking only sips of water. Her postoperative pain has been well controlled on a hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Her indwelling urinary catheter was removed on the second postoperative day and she is now voiding freely. Although she lies supine in bed for most of the day, she is able to walk around the hospital room with the help of a physical therapist. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 132/92 mm Hg. She is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 115 kg (253 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m^2. Examination shows a mildly distended, tympanic abdomen; bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. An x-ray of the abdomen shows uniform distribution of gas in the small bowel, colon, and rectum without air-fluid levels. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Postoperative ileus is one of the most common causes of paralytic ileus. Intraabdominal surgery itself results in inflammation of the intestinal wall, impairing coordinated propulsive peristalsis of the intestinal smooth muscle. Opioids, such as the hydromorphone that was used for analgesia in this patient, also have an inhibitory effect on peristalsis, which has likely contributed to the development of paralytic ileus. Treatment consists mainly of supportive measures (i.e., bowel rest, using a nasogastric tube for intestinal decompression, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte correction). Drugs that might sustain or prolong paralytic ileus (e.g., anticholinergics, opioids) should be reduced or discontinued, if possible, while NSAIDs or acetaminophen should be administered for pain control.",

    "question_text": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease 5 years ago. The daughter reports that in the past year, her mother has become nonambulatory, can speak only a few intelligible words, and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite and progressive dysphagia, resulting in a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She has been hospitalized three times for aspiration pneumonia, and her diet now consists only of puréed food. She has no advance directives. The daughter says that she does not want her mother to return to the hospital again, but she is concerned about her ability to continue providing care alone. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but well groomed. The patient is oriented only to self. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 0/30, and Functional Assessment Staging Tool scale is 7/7. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B_12 are within the reference ranges. Her serum albumin concentration is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He reports that it is becoming gradually more difficult to care for her. She occasionally has tantrums and there are times when she does not recognize him. She sleeps 6–8 hours throughout the day and is increasingly agitated and confused at night. When the phone, television, or oven beeps she thinks she is at the dentist's office and becomes very anxious. She eats 2–3 meals a day and has a good appetite. She has not fallen. She has not left the home in weeks except for short walks. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She takes levothyroxine, aspirin, warfarin, donepezil, verapamil, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin daily.  Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. It is important to the family that the patient continues her care at home. Which of the following recommendations is most appropriate at this time?",

Although this patient is agitated and has been having difficulty sleeping, pharmacological treatment would only be indicated if nonpharmacological interventions had failed. Behavioral therapies have the same or increased efficacy compared to antipsychotic medications in this patient population.",

This patient's anxiety is likely a consequence of her dysregulated sleep (i.e., nighttime insomnia and daytime hypersomnia) and resulting disorientation.

This class of drugs inhibits the Na^+-Cl^- cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, resulting in decreased intracellular Na^+. This, in turn, enhances the activity of the Na^+-Ca^2+ exchanger, and increases the driving force for Ca^2+ resorption, which worsens hypercalcemia. Loop diuretics, not thiazide diuretics, may be considered in patients with hypercalcemia and renal insufficiency (as is the case here) to increase Ca^2+  secretion and prevent volume overload while receiving IV fluids.",

Although this patient has renal insufficiency, he only has moderate hypercalcemia, some renal function, and no neurologic symptoms.

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid, pamidronate) are the first-line treatment for symptomatic hypercalcemia due to excessive bone resorption from any cause (e.g., prolonged immobilization). This class of drugs inhibits osteoclast activity, which decreases bone breakdown and calcium release. Dosage adjustment and close monitoring of renal function are recommended during bisphosphonate therapy in patients with renal impairment, as bisphosphonates are potentially nephrotoxic. In addition, calcitonin should be administered in patients with moderate or severe symptomatic hypercalcemia to increase urinary calcium excretion. Patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia are usually also dehydrated and require intravenous normal saline to lower blood calcium levels and achieve adequate urine output and blood pressure.\n\nMost patients with intact renal function and no other preexisting condition for high bone turnover (e.g., Paget disease of bone, malignancy) are able to compensate for increased bone resorption through increased urinary calcium excretion (i.e., hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia). However, this patient's renal insufficiency limits his ability to excrete calcium in the urine, resulting in hypercalcemia.",

The estimate of life expectancy can be made by the treating physician or the medical director of a care facility after considering appropriate data and input from others. Goals of hospice care include the palliation of symptoms for comfort (e.g., opioid analgesics for pain, sedatives for agitation), improvement of patient and caregiver independence (e.g., freedom from wall-mounted oxygen supplementation, assistance from nursing staff), and preservation of patient dignity (e.g., removal of intravenous lines, minimization of physical examinations).",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's use of opioid analgesics for pain increases his risk of developing respiratory depression. However, one fundamental aspect of hospice care is the principle of double effect, which describes the tendency to tolerate and accept the negative effects of a management strategy (e.g., respiratory depression) because of the positive effects of that strategy (e.g., pain control). The use of opioid analgesics is appropriate for this patient with worsening pain. Many patients on hospice care use long-acting opioid analgesics, which are associated with a higher risk of developing respiratory depression compared to short-acting formulations.",

Today, an abdominal x-ray shows a large bowel obstruction. The patient appears lethargic and thin. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She expresses that she does not want to receive any lifesaving procedures. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of her decision. The patient's eldest daughter, who is in the emergency department, says that she wants her mother to receive all necessary measures to stay alive.

This patient has demonstrated that she has decision-making capacity, and therefore her wishes should be followed. The surrogate health care decision-maker is only permitted to make a decision on the patient's behalf if the patient's decision-making capacity is compromised. Moreover, the patient's current decision is consistent with her decision not to undergo a colostomy 3 weeks prior. Therefore, no lifesaving measures should be undertaken. In this case, management should focus on comfort measures such as pain control and consideration of a colonic stent.",

    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "The shallow but rapid breathing, insomnia, and features of sympathetic activation (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension) are most likely due to pain.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This patient's severe, persistent pain indicates that he is currently not receiving an adequate dosage of morphine. Under close monitoring, a titrated increase in opioid dosage (typically by 25–50% every 24 hours until the desired pain relief is achieved) minimizes the risks of severe side effects (e.g., respiratory depression). For individuals on patient-controlled analgesia, this dosage titration can be achieved by decreasing the duration of the lockout period, increasing the single bolus limit, and/or increasing the daily dose limit of the opioid. In addition, a continuous low-dose infusion of opioids or nonopioid analgesics can be used as an adjuvant for pain relief.",

        "explanation_why": "Sleep medications (e.g., zolpidem) are a short-term treatment for primary insomnia. In patients with secondary insomnia (e.g., due to pain, as seen here), an attempt should be made to treat the underlying cause before considering sleep medications. Nonopioid analgesics (NOAs) are not as effective as opioids in providing pain relief (they are on a lower rung of the WHO analgesic ladder). In patients who are already receiving opioids without adequate pain relief, certain NOAs (e.g., ketorolac) can be used as adjuncts but not as a replacement.",

        "explanation_why": "Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems, which allow patients to titrate medication based on their level of pain, have a lockout period to prevent the delivery of an inappropriately high dose of analgesic if patients try to administer medication too frequently. Therefore, an intentional morphine overdose is unlikely, and removing PCA would not be effective in the management of this patient's pain.",

This patient's shallow but rapid breathing is most likely due to pain rather than opioid-induced respiratory depression, which causes bradypnea.

He initially noticed difficulty writing but now has difficulty performing his activities of daily living. He currently lives with his son. He has no personal or family history of serious illness and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. There is mild atrophy and twitching of the tongue. Muscle strength is decreased in the upper extremities and normal in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the upper extremities, 4+ in the right lower extremity, and 2+ in the left lower extremity. Sensation to pinprick, light touch, and vibration is intact in all extremities. On mental status examination, he is cooperative with a mildly anxious mood and a neutral affect. His speech is slightly slurred and hypernasal. Needle electromyography shows spontaneous fasciculation potentials in multiple muscles, fibrillations, and positive sharp wave potentials. Spirometry shows an FVC of 85% of predicted. A diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is made and treatment with riluzole is initiated. After discussion with the patient and his son, a decision to transfer the patient to hospice care is made. Before transferring the patient to hospice care, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "ALS is characterized by concomitant upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron dysfunction and can manifest with pseudobulbar palsy and bulbar palsy, both of which result in dysphagia. Dysphagia increases the risk for aspiration and/or insufficient fluid and food intake, leading to complications in patients with ALS (e.g., aspiration pneumonia, weight loss). A bedside swallowing test should therefore be performed in all patients with ALS to screen for dysphagia. If the test is positive, a formal swallowing study (e.g., videofluoroscopic swallowing examination) is required to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with ALS who have swallowing difficulties may need specialized nutritional support (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids, nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). Bedside swallowing test is also performed for other neurological conditions that manifest with dysphagia, such as Parkinson disease, acute stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\nIn addition to the bedside swallowing test, this patient should be asked about their wishes regarding resuscitation. ALS can result in cognitive impairment in the later stages, and the patient's resuscitation wishes (e.g., do not resuscitate order) should be determined while their mental faculties are intact.",

They should also be involved in and encouraged to discuss all aspects of care (i.e., physical, psychosocial, spiritual). This should also apply in a palliative setting, where the goal is to relieve suffering and provide the best possible quality of life. Parental consent must be obtained before proceeding with any medical procedure (e.g., placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or treatment decision (e.g., transfer to hospice care).

The decision of whether and how to explain the prognosis to a pediatric patient is highly individual and depends on the patient's cognitive development. Although preschoolers (< 6 years of age) are often unable to conceptualize death, it is important to help them understand their situation by giving simple and concrete information and with the help of trained specialists and creative approaches (e.g., music therapy, puppets). As children become more mature, their understanding of death develops and it may be appropriate for them to participate in medical decisions.

Although this patient has insufficient pain control and a cough, the symptom of coughing while swallowing indicates oropharyngeal dysphagia and a high risk of aspiration. Therefore, a medication that can be administered via a non-oral route should be considered.

    "question_text": "A 65-year old man with advanced prostate cancer is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of dyspnea and severe back pain. He rates his pain as an 8 on a 10 point scale. For the past 2 years, the patient failed to respond to multiple chemotherapy cycles. He was previously independent but now lives with his son and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. His son says that his father's condition “is deteriorating every day” and that he “cannot cope with the stress of taking care of him anymore.” The patient has had progressive loss of mobility and worsening pain for the past 6 months. During this time, he also has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and a 15-kg (33-lb) weight loss. He spends most of the day in bed and cannot tolerate walking without aid. Current medications include acetaminophen, oxycodone, and a fentanyl patch. He appears pale and malnourished. He is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination shows marked tenderness along the spine. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows multiple well-demarcated lesions in both lungs and in several vertebrae. The patient has no living will and says he wants to \"die in peace.\" The physician, son, and the rest of the patient's family agree to start hospice care. Which of the following is the most significant factor that affects eligibility for hospice care in this patient?",

At a visit 3 weeks ago, the patient reported severe weight loss and loss of appetite. The physician recommended palliative percutaneous gastrostomy and explained the procedure as well as its benefits and possible complications. At the time, the patient objected to the procedure, stating that he did not wish to undergo any surgical procedures or life-prolonging interventions, including resuscitation. He designated his brother as the medical power of attorney. Current medications include quetiapine, hydromorphone-acetaminophen, and prednisolone. The patient appears cachectic and ill. He is 176 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 51 kg (112 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m^2. He is alert and fully oriented. His vital signs are within normal limits. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. He has a flat affect. He denies auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations. At the current visit, the patient appears to have changed his mind and wishes to undergo the procedure. His brother is present during the consultation and strongly disagrees with the patient's choice. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",

However, asking grieving family members to identify a deceased patient should be avoided (e.g., by using the hospital identification tag instead). Moreover, this response conceals the purpose of the physician's visit (i.e., pronouncing death) and is, therefore, inappropriate. Even if the deceased patient's family members have not yet been informed of the death, the physician should always address them in a clear, empathic manner and avoid euphemisms (e.g., “finalize his medical records”).",

        "explanation_why": "This statement is the most appropriate way to address the family members of a deceased patient after an expected death. After a self-introduction, the physician should offer condolences with simple empathic statements (e.g., “I am sorry for your loss,” “This is a difficult time”) and clearly state the purpose of the visit. The physician should then invite the family to remain in the room and ask questions. If available, psychological and spiritual support services (e.g., grief counseling, chaplains) should be offered to the family. Subsequently, the death pronouncement process is begun and consists of confirming the patient's identity, examining for responses to tactile stimuli, looking for fixed and dilated pupils, and checking for at least one minute for the absence of each of the following: carotid pulses, chest movement, heart and breath sounds, and recordable blood pressure. The time at which the examination is concluded is the time at which death is confirmed (stated as the time of death). During this examination, the physician should refrain from talking too much in order to allow the family to grieve.\n\nIf the patient does not have an advance directive regarding organ or body donation and a forensic autopsy is not indicated, the family should be asked if they wish to have a clinical autopsy. If the family does not wish to have one, the physician can seek permission for organ or body donation if applicable. If a forensic autopsy is indicated, the local death investigation office (e.g., coroner) should be informed, even if the family does not consent. Following the declaration of death, the physician who pronounced the death should enter a death note in the patient's records; further death documentation should be performed by the physician(s) who were responsible for the patient's care.",

Opioids relieve dyspnea through various mechanisms, including altering central perception of dyspnea, reducing anxiety, and decreasing the respiratory drive. The opioid dose should be slowly titrated until the optimal risk-benefit ratio between efficacy and adverse effects (e.g., constipation, nausea, pruritus, bronchospasm, drowsiness) has been reached. Patients and caregivers should be informed about the benefits and safe use of opioid therapy, as well as treatment of adverse effects (e.g., stimulant laxatives for constipation).",

Treating anxiety may reduce the severity of dyspnea. However, this patient shows no signs of anxiety and has not yet received nonpharmacological or first-line pharmacological therapies. Furthermore, monotherapy with benzodiazepines is not routinely recommended for terminally ill patients with dyspnea.\n\nBenzodiazepines are also used for palliative sedation, which may be initiated to relieve severe distress at the end of life in patients with refractory symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, pain), terminal agitation, or perceived discomfort. However, sedation should only be used after all other attempts to control or relieve symptoms have failed. The decision to start palliative sedation should be made under the guidance of a palliative care physician and/or a medical ethicist. Because the treatment induces unconsciousness and may hasten death, the plan should be discussed with the patient, caregivers, and/or family, who must give informed consent before sedation begins.",

The patient was previously independent but is now bedridden and requires assistance for all of his daily activities. The physician is concerned about the patient's well-being because he seems demoralized and does not interact with hospital staff or other patients. He never has visitors. When the physician inquires about his mood, the patient only replies, “I just want to be left alone and watch TV.\" The physician has passed by the patient's room on several occasions and noticed church services playing on his TV. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician to support the patient at this point?",

        "explanation_why": "Terminal illness can cause spiritual distress, which negatively affects physical and mental well-being (e.g., increased risk of depression, uncontrollable pain, anxiety). Health care professionals should assess a patient's spirituality and signs of associated distress by taking a spiritual history (e.g., asking the patient if they consider themself religious or about the importance of spirituality in their life). If the patient identifies as spiritual or religious and shows signs of spiritual distress, referral to a board-certified chaplain of their faith is advised. Chaplains can provide spiritual care, which includes attending to the terminally ill individual's spiritual and/or religious needs and beliefs, helping them to cope with their illness, and assisting in medical decisions (e.g., whether to continue life-sustaining treatments). This process also strengthens the physician-patient relationship while increasing patient satisfaction and overall quality of life.",

For patients with diabetes mellitus, a simplified antidiabetic regimen and less strict glycemic control are recommended; short-acting insulins can be discontinued. Drug interactions, the risk of adverse events, and the patient burden should all be considered when assessing medications for deprescription. Medications that should generally be continued to maximize patient comfort include analgesics, antiemetics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antiseizure agents.\n\nBecause some patients do not tolerate oral intake, routes of medication administration should be adapted in the palliative care setting.

During three of the previous hospitalizations, trials of bilevel positive airway pressure were unsuccessful, and she was intubated. Although she did not require intubation during this admission, she confides to the physician before discharge that she is tired of going to the intensive care unit and does not want to be intubated in the future. The physician discusses what matters most to her, and she says it is her independence. She understands that she could be in a situation in which she may die without intubation and says, “I’ve lived a long life. I’m not afraid of dying. I just want to be comfortable when the time comes.” She clearly states that she does not want to be intubated again or to be resuscitated. The physician determines that the patient has the mental capacity to make this decision. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician to ensure that all future care providers provide care in line with the patient's preferences?",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has clearly stated her wishes regarding intubation and resuscitation, and there is no concern about her mental capacity to make this decision. The best way to document her preferences is to complete a portable orders for life-sustaining therapy (POLST) form, which turns a patient’s care preferences into specific medical orders that easily travel with the patient across the healthcare system and can be directly used in a medical emergency. The POLST form is completed by the patient's healthcare provider and is signed by both the provider and the patient (or healthcare proxy if the patient does not have decision-making capacity). Regulations vary by state regarding which providers can complete POLST forms, and may include physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. In some US states, POLST is known by medical orders for life-sustaining treatment (MOLST), physician orders for scope of treatment (POST), or another similar term. One copy of the POLST form should be retained by the patient or healthcare proxy, ideally in a place that is easily accessible in the case of an emergency, and another copy remains in a prominent place in the patient’s medical records. The POLST form can be changed by a healthcare provider according to the patient’s or healthcare proxy’s wishes.\n\nA living will, on the other hand, is a legal document outlining a patient's preferences in a broad range of potential future scenarios in which they cannot make decisions due to incapacitation. Living wills are prepared by the patient and can guide healthcare providers but are not medical orders and are not easily portable across different care settings.",

Consequently, most DNR orders cannot be maintained in the operative setting. When a patient with a DNR order requires a surgical procedure, the most appropriate step is to complete a procedure-specific DNR. Historically, DNR orders have been automatically suspended during procedures, but this practice limits patients’ autonomy by assuming knowledge of what they want. Currently, a process called “required reconsideration” in which the patient or surrogate, the surgeon, and the anesthesiologist revisit the DNR order for the perioperative setting during the informed consent process. Older children and adolescents should be included in discussions about their DNR orders and assent to DNR decisions to the extent that they are developmentally capable of doing so. Together, these individuals should discuss overall patient care goals and specific potential interventions that may be required. They should also define when the perioperative period officially ends and the preceding DNR order goes back into effect.",

Care should be person-centered (i.e., aligned with the patient’s goals) to avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment of symptoms and based on the principle of substituted judgment. However, specific questions about the patient's goals of care should be deferred until the family’s prognostic awareness is assessed, so that clinicians can ensure families have the information they need to engage in shared decision-making regarding the next steps.\n\nDuring advance care planning, it is also important to identify the appropriate legal surrogate decision-maker appointed by the patient. If no one has been appointed, as in this scenario, the physician should help the family assign someone to be a healthcare proxy. These steps can help prevent conflicts in the future.
