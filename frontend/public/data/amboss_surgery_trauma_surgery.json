        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↑ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↓ SVR, and ↓ CVP is seen in some cases of distributive shock (e.g., early septic shock), not in hypovolemic shock. Distributive shock is sometimes referred to as warm shock because it involves inappropriate peripheral vasodilation (causing ↓ CVP, ↓ SVR, and thus ↓ PCWP) and increased CO, which leads to excessive blood delivery to the limbs, resulting in inappropriately warm limbs in a hypotensive patient. This patient's limbs are cool, which indicates appropriate peripheral vasoconstriction in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure. In addition, this patient has no history of infection that would predispose to septic shock.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↓ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↑ SVR, and ↓ CVP is characteristic of hypovolemic shock (hemorrhagic shock). Hemorrhage (e.g., after a gunshot wound) leads to intravascular volume depletion, which decreases venous return to the right atrium (as evidenced by ↓ CVP). Reduced venous return to the right heart results in decreased blood delivery to the left atrium (evident in ↓ PCWP) and consequently low left ventricular end diastolic volume (i.e., decreased preload). Low preload causes decreased CO (because the heart cannot pump blood that is not there). Because low CO leads to hypotension, the peripheral vasculature constricts (↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain blood pressure that is adequate for organ perfusion.\n\nSee “Overview of the types of shock” table.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↓ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↑ SVR, and ↑ CVP is characteristic of obstructive shock (e.g., massive pulmonary embolism), not hypovolemic shock. In obstructive shock, blood flow from the right heart to the left heart is blocked, which causes blood to “back up” into the right atrium, causing increased CVP. Insufficient blood is delivered to the LA, leading to decreased LA pressure (and thus ↓ PCWP) and little preload for the LV (causing ↓ CO). Low CO results in hypotension, which induces peripheral vascular constriction (and thus ↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure. This patient's history of a gunshot wound to the abdomen and free fluid in the abdomen suggest a different form of shock.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↓ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↓ SVR, and ↓ CVP is seen in some cases of distributive shock (especially neurogenic shock), not in hypovolemic shock. Neurogenic shock typically results from severe CNS trauma (e.g., spinal cord transection) and is associated with other neurologic abnormalities (e.g., paralysis). Neurogenic shock is believed to be caused by loss of autonomic control of cardiovascular parameters due to CNS damage. Heart rate is characteristically low in neurogenic shock (likely due to excessive vagal tone), which leads to decreased CO. SVR is low because of peripheral vasodilation due to loss of sympathetic tone. Peripheral vasodilation causes decreased venous return to the heart, leading to low CVP and consequently low LA pressure (and thus low PCWP). This patient has no history or physical findings to suggest neurologic injury and he is tachycardic on examination.",

His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 103/min, and blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg. Examination shows a 6-cm edematous deep, foul-smelling wound on the medial surface of the right thigh. The skin over the thigh appears darker than the skin on the lower leg. There are multiple blisters around the wound. Light palpation around the wound causes severe pain; crepitus is present.

She had two similar episodes last year that were treated conservatively. She was treated for a fracture of her humerus 2 years ago. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her sister has allergic rhinitis. Her only medication is omeprazole. She appears tense and uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows mild scoliosis. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows a mid-systolic click. The right knee shows a large, tender effusion and the patella is displaced laterally. Lachman test, posterior drawer test, and Apley test are negative. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. X-ray of the knee joint shows an osteochondral fragment within the knee joint. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "A laterally displaced patella, right knee effusion and pain, a past history of similar episodes, and a history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome make the diagnosis of acute patellar dislocation highly likely. The osteochondral fragment within the knee joint indicates an avulsion fracture of the lateral femoral condyle or patella.",

        "explanation_why": "In a patient with a patellar dislocation and a concurrent osteochondral fracture, knee arthroscopy is the initial procedure indicated to either repair the osteochondral defect or remove the intraarticular fragment if a repair cannot be performed. Following removal of the fragment, reduction is performed intraoperatively, and the knee is flexed and extended through its entire range of motion.\n\nIndividuals with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often present with joint hypermobility, which puts them at increased risk for joint dislocations (especially of the knee and shoulder).",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Above-knee casts are rarely used to immobilize the knee after the initial treatment of patellar dislocations nowadays because prolonged immobilization is associated with a higher risk of restricted joint movement, while early physiotherapy and functional bracing are associated with better outcomes. If fracture of the distal femur or tibia occurs along with patellar dislocation, an above-knee cast may be used for immobilization after initial treatment.

This question aims at testing the management of patella dislocation complicated by an osteochondral fracture, which is seen in approximately 30–40% of patients with acute patellar dislocation. The osteochondral fracture should be repaired or removed before reducing the patellar dislocation to prevent osteochondral damage, which can occur during reduction as a result of shearing forces.",

He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 17 years and drinks an average of one alcoholic beverage daily. His medications include levocetirizine and pantoprazole. He is in moderate distress. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 112/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple bruises over both lower extremities and the face. There is swelling surrounding a 2-cm laceration 13 cm below the right knee. The lower two-thirds of the tibia is tender to palpation and the skin is pale and cool to the touch. The anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak. Capillary refill time of the right big toe is 4 seconds. Passive dorsiflexion of his right foot causes severe pain in his calf. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. An x-ray of the right leg shows a dislocated fracture of the tibial center with posterior displacement of the distal tibial part. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

It should be conducted within six hours of the onset of clinical symptoms (to prevent necrosis, irreversible nerve damage, and possible amputation) and followed up with open wound management. The diagnosis is primarily clinical; however, needle manometry to calculate the delta pressure (diastolic blood pressure - intracompartmental pressure) is often performed to confirm the diagnosis. A delta pressure < 30 mm Hg confirms acute compartment syndrome, which is an indication for fasciotomy. For patients who present extremely late (3–5 days after onset), amputation is the treatment of last resort.",

Although tension pneumothorax may also manifest with decreased oxygen saturation and deep sulcus sign, further findings such as contralateral tracheal deviation, distended neck veins, cyanosis, and hemodynamic instability (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension) are commonly seen.",

Chest x-ray of patients with ARDS usually reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates, air bronchogram, atelectasis, and pleural effusions. This patient's x-ray indicates a pneumothorax, most likely due to increased pressures during mechanical ventilation. Increasing the PEEP is contraindicated as it would exacerbate his condition.",

        "explanation_why": "Insertion of a chest tube into the 4^th–5^th intercostal space between the anterior and midaxillary line (safe triangle) is the most appropriate next step for treating pneumothorax in a mechanically ventilated patient. Mechanical ventilation (especially with a high positive end-expiratory pressure) is considered a risk factor for developing pneumothorax. High ventilatory pressure can damage the lung tissue, causing a leak that allows air to enter the pleural cavity. Because the air entering the pleural space comes from the lung rather than the exterior, it is known as a closed pneumothorax. Following completion of the procedure, another chest x-ray to control the position of chest tube placement should be performed. To prevent further lung damage, the ventilatory pressure should be decreased.\n\nPneumothorax is often hard to diagnose in ventilated patients. Since the x-ray is obtained in the supine position, less air collects apically, making the pneumothorax less obvious.",

    "hint": "A painful swollen knee, restricted range of motion, low-grade fever, and synovial fluid analysis showing purulent synovial fluid and increased WBC count with neutrophil predominance are suggestive of infectious arthritis.

This patient underwent an arthroplasty in her right knee 5 months ago and is now presenting with septic arthritis, which makes a foreign body infection very likely. S. epidermidis is the most common cause of prosthetic infections 3–12 months after surgery. If this patient had presented within < 3 months after the arthroplasty or > 12 months after surgery, Staphylococcus aureus would be most likely. Treatment of prosthetic joint infections usually consists of removal of the prosthesis and debridement of the bone and surrounding tissue, followed by IV antibiotics (e.g., oxacillin or ceftriaxone) for 6–8 weeks. Reimplantation of the prosthesis should be performed after repeat negative synovial fluid cultures or after completion of antimicrobial therapy if clinical signs of infection are absent.",

        "explanation_why": "In uncomplicated extensor digitorum tendon injuries (no associated displaced fractures, extension deficit < 45°), a stack splint is used to stabilize the joint for 6–8 weeks in slight hyperextension in order to achieve a close approximation of the tendon ends and full recovery. When applying splints to areas with bony protuberances, as in this case, excessive direct pressure from the splint must be avoided. Continuous pressure can lead to skin necrosis and subsequent healing disorders and infections.",

Although both of these conditions can be caused by penetrating chest trauma and result in tachycardia, hypotension, and jugular venous distention, this patient does not have reduced breath sounds, which is a characteristic auscultatory finding in both of these conditions.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In cardiac tamponade, outward expansion of the ventricles is limited because of fluid in the pericardial space. During inspiration, increased venous return leads to increased right ventricular volume. As outward expansion is limited, the right ventricle expands via the interventricular septum, which bulges into the left ventricle. This effect leads to further reduction in left ventricular filling during inspiration, resulting in decreased stroke volume and a subsequent drop in blood pressure. A drop in systolic blood pressure > 10 mm Hg during inspiration is known as pulsus paradoxus, a sign characteristically seen in moderate and severe cardiac tamponade but also in some cases of severe asthma, tension pneumothorax, and constrictive pericarditis.",

        "explanation_why": "Diaphragmatic rupture is most commonly caused by penetrating injuries, followed by blunt trauma, both of which can be caused by a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Clinical features include chest/abdominal wall bruises, decreased breath sounds due to herniation of abdominal contents into the chest, and respiratory distress. Chest auscultation may reveal bowel sounds. Chest x-ray may show disturbed contour of the hemidiaphragm, displaced abdominal organs, and mediastinal shift, as well as an hourglass sign if abdominal contents are constricted at the defect. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nDiaphragmatic ruptures more commonly occur on the left side because the right diaphragm is protected by the liver. Patients may initially be asymptomatic, so this condition is often not diagnosed immediately.",

Patients with esophageal perforation present with chest pain, tachycardia, and tachypnea. However, this condition is often associated with additional findings such as fever and crepitus over the chest due to mediastinal emphysema. Unlike in this patient, a chest x-ray typically shows a widened mediastinum. Herniation of the stomach into the thorax is not typically associated with esophageal perforation.",

        "explanation_why": "A barium swallow may be used to confirm suspected diaphragmatic rupture by showing abdominal contents above the diaphragm. However, a barium swallow test is not routinely used in the diagnosis of traumatic diaphragmatic rupture, as the procedure is lengthier and less precise than other procedures and requires the patient's cooperation. Moreover, traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are often associated with other injuries such as esophageal tears. If barium, a water-insoluble contrast media, enters the mediastinum through a perforation, it may lead to mediastinitis and subsequent fibrosis. A barium study should therefore only be performed after perforations of the gastrointestinal tract have been ruled out.",

On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 88/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left main bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, left pleural effusion, and a widened mediastinum.

The left hemidiaphragm (black dotted line) is much higher than the right one. The stomach is located within the thorax, as can be seen by the circled gastric bubble. The lung tissue shows streaky densities, which hints towards intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Only around 20% of patients with blunt traumatic aortic injuries survive long enough to reach the hospital; therefore, immediate resuscitation and prompt surgical repair of the thoracic aorta is required in patients with suggestive findings (e.g., symptoms of respiratory distress, features of hemorrhagic shock).",

He has pain in his right arm, forehead, and pelvis. He also has an urge to urinate but has been unable to do so since the accident. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.9°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 118/82 mm Hg. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. There are abrasions over his scalp and face and a 1 x 3 cm area of ecchymosis above his right eye. His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Musculoskeletal examination shows tenderness and ecchymosis over the right distal forearm with intact pulses, sensation, and capillary refill. There is no tenderness of the cervical spine. Abdominal examination shows suprapubic tenderness. A scant amount of blood is present at the urethral meatus. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows a fracture of both ipsilateral pubic rami. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Contrast extravasation from the urethra indicates the precise location of the injury. In addition to the inability to void and blood at the urethral meatus, both seen here, findings that raise concern for posterior urethral injury include scrotal and perineal ecchymoses and a high-riding prostate on digital rectal examination.\n\nFoley catheterization should be avoided in patients with suspected urethral injury because it may worsen the condition.",

The patient has severe pain in her left leg and torso, and minimal pain in her right arm. She does not smoke cigarettes. She takes no medications. She is tearful and in moderate distress. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 118/65 mm Hg. Her pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There are two tender, blanchable erythemas without blisters over a 5 x 6-cm area of the left abdomen and a 3 x 2-cm area of the left anterior thigh. There is also an area of white, leathery skin and tissue necrosis encircling the right upper extremity just proximal to the elbow, which is dry and nontender. An ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no ST or T wave changes. Administration of intravenous fluids is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

A chest x-ray is therefore indicated in burn patients who present with symptoms of ARDS (e.g., dyspnea, tachypnea, low oxygen saturation, cyanosis). However, this is not the case for this patient, who is hemodynamically stable and breathing normally.",

While this woman shows signs of compromised distal perfusion (reduced capillary refill, pallor, and peripheral O_2 saturation of 84%) that could also be due to developing ACS, the vascular compromise is more likely caused by the circumferential eschar itself. Furthermore, ACS is generally associated with severe pain, often out of proportion to the extent of the injury. This patient only has minimal pain in her right arm, resulting from the third-degree burn that has destroyed the cutaneous nerves. Sensation of the deeper layers, including the muscle compartments, however, should still be intact.",

Tension pneumothorax may develop if a rib fracture causes a pulmonary laceration that fails to seal and can manifest with chest pain, dyspnea, decreased breath sounds, and contralateral deviation of the trachea. However, a patient with pneumothorax would have hyperresonant lung fields on percussion instead of dullness on the affected site. Also, a chest x-ray would show increased radiolucency and decreased lung markings rather than increased opacity.",

Moreover, this patient has none of the classical clinical manifestations of cardiac tamponade, which include low systolic blood pressure (due to decreased stroke volume), distention of neck veins (due to impaired right ventricular filling), and/or muffled heart sounds.

This patient's blood pressure and mental state are normal, and the examination of the abdomen does not reveal guarding, rebound tenderness, or evisceration. An abdominal CT scan is therefore indicated to assess the extent of injury and detect intraabdominal bleeding. A CT scan is also helpful for subsequent planning of surgical procedures and identifying patients who can be managed conservatively.\n\nPatients with penetrating abdominal trauma may undergo FAST prior to a CT scan. Although FAST is highly specific for hemopericardium and hemoperitoneum, this test has low sensitivity (especially for hollow organ or diaphragmatic injuries with minimal bleeding).",

According to his mother, the boy was running in the yard when he fell and injured his right arm. The boy is crying and clutching his arm. During the past year, he has been brought in 4 other times for extremity pain following falls, all of which have been diagnosed as long bone fractures. He is at the 10^th percentile for height and 25^th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 97/68 mm Hg. His right forearm is diffusely erythematous. The patient withdraws and yells when his forearm is touched. His left arm has two small ecchymotic regions overlying the elbow and wrist. A photograph of his eyes is shown. An x-ray of the right forearm shows a transverse mid-ulnar fracture with diffusely decreased bone density. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "question_text": "An 11-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from her bicycle. The girl was racing with her cousin when she lost control and fell onto her right side. She has nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder. She is in acute distress. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg.

    "question_text": "A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after falling 16 feet from a ladder. He has severe pain in both his legs and his right arm. He appears pale and diaphoretic. He is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m^2.

        "explanation_why": "High pulse pressure is usually caused by an increase in stroke volume (e.g., normal exercise, aortic regurgitation) or a decrease in arterial compliance (e.g., atherosclerosis) and would likely increase following fluid resuscitation. However, pulse pressure is an indicator of stroke volume and not a direct indicator of end-organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation aims to achieve adequate end-organ perfusion, so a change in pulse pressure is not the best indicator to evaluate fluid resuscitation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion and to restore intravascular volume. Since renal blood flow (and therefore GFR) is highly sensitive to changes in blood pressure and intravascular volume, urine output can serve as a surrogate measure to determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate. Ideally, urine output in adults should be greater than 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Therefore, a 70-kg man should have a urine output of 35–70 mL/hr. A urine output of 25mL in 3 hours suggests that his kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow and therefore that he has not received adequate fluid resuscitation.\n\nWith adequate fluid resuscitation, an increase in some of the other indices, such as pulse pressure and Glasgow coma scale, might occur before a change in urine output is apparent. However, these parameters are not specific indicators of end-organ perfusion. Other parameters, such as lactate and a base deficit, are more useful for determining the prognosis than for guiding fluid therapy.",

However, serum lactate levels are not used to determine whether fluid resuscitation is inadequate because, even after adequate fluid resuscitation and correction of tissue hypoperfusion, lactate levels may not reach normal levels (< 2 mEq/L) for a few hours. Lactate clearance may take even longer in critically ill patients as a result of a prolonged lactate half-life (due to hepatic and/or renal dysfunction) and/or increased glycolysis. In trauma patients, elevated lactate levels are associated with increased mortality and are used to evaluate the prognosis.",

A small residual right pneumothorax (arrowheads) is visible and pneumomediastinum is seen along the trachea, main bronchi, and cardiac silhouette (red overlay and arrows). A chest tube (yellow overlay) is in place, with its tip in the apex of the right hemithorax.Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax can result from blunt or penetrating thoracic injury and various other conditions (e.g., lung disease, intestinal perforation, medical procedure). Air that escapes from the lungs, airways, or bowel can track into the mediastinal and subcutaneous soft tissues.",

This patient exhibits all the signs and symptoms of a massive hemothorax, i.e., tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, flat neck veins, decreased breath sounds, and dullness on percussion on the affected side, as well as tracheal deviation to the opposite side. A hemothorax must be drained in most cases because blood in the pleural cavity may clot if not evacuated, resulting in a trapped lung (impaired lung expansion due to the clot) or an empyema (due to clot infection). Treatment usually consists of chest tube insertion into the 4^th–5^th intercostal space at the midaxillary line in order to allow the blood to drain away and improve lung ventilation. Conservative management may be considered to treat small hemothoraces in consultation with a specialist but has a significant failure rate.",

No gastric air bubble is seen projecting over the lower left hemithorax to suggest marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm from a large amount of atelectasis, but concave upper lateral borders, or menisci (white dashed lines), help confirm the presence of effusion extending to the mid thorax.The margins of the cardiac silhouette and left hemidiaphragm are obscured. Additionally, the cardiac silhouette is shifted slightly to the right (indicated by blue line and arrow) and the left bronchial tree is slightly elevated (indicated by black lines and arrow).In the right hemithorax, a small meniscus from effusion is seen laterally (indicated by red line).

This floating rib cage segment is decoupled from the chest wall and causes paradoxical chest movement. Upon inspiration, as the intrathoracic pressure drops, the unstable segment will be pulled inwards by the negative pressure, and during expiration, the floating segment moves outward. This condition usually results from high-energy blunt trauma to the chest (e.g., motor vehicle collision). Patients with flail chest commonly present with features of respiratory distress (e.g., dyspnea, tachypnea), which can be due to hypoventilation (as a result of pain), pulmonary contusions, pneumothorax, and/or hemothorax.",

The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He initially thought the pain would resolve with rest but it became more severe over the last 2 hours. Last year while rock climbing he fell onto his right shoulder and “needed a sling to fix it.” He has psoriasis. His only medication is topical clobetasol. His pulse is 95/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 114/70 mm Hg. Examination shows full passive and active range of motion of the left shoulder. There is no tenderness to palpation at the acromioclavicular joint. There are silvery plaques over both knees and elbows. Abdominal examination shows severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant with voluntary guarding. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes are within the reference range. Chest x-ray is normal. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma shows no evidence of free intraperitoneal fluid. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Although unsupported by high-quality evidence, serial monitoring of vital signs for a period of 9 hours without imaging may be a reasonable approach following trauma for hemodynamically stable patients with a low risk of abdominal injury. This patient, however, has fallen from a height of 10 feet and has left upper quadrant pain and guarding, as well as a positive Kehr sign, all of which indicate a splenic injury that requires additional abdominal imaging.",

CT scan has greater specificity than ultrasonography for diagnosing splenic lacerations because it can visualize the vasculature and parenchyma of the spleen in high resolution. Findings on the CT scan are used to grade splenic injury and guide further management. CT scan can also rule out other concomitant injuries in cases of abdominal trauma, especially injuries involving retroperitoneal structures.",

Intrasplenic low-attenuation rounded and linear areas are sites of laceration and hematoma formation. Multiple small high-density foci along the inferior aspect of the spleen indicate contrast extravasation (arrows) from active bleeding.Hemorrhage (green overlay) into the peritoneal space extends from the spleen inferiorly along the paracolic gutter. Hemorrhagic fluid is also seen along the liver (yellow overlay) and within the right paracolic gutter and pelvis (yellow overlay).Multiple thoracic spine fractures (examples indicated by arrowheads) are accompanied by paravertebral hematoma (red overlay).",

However, this patient is hemodynamically stable and a FAST scan was negative for free intraperitoneal fluid. In addition, although highly sensitive, DPL has largely fallen out of favor because it is an invasive procedure; it may, however, be necessary in some cases (e.g., in resource-poor settings).",

The lucid interval represents the time it takes for blood to accumulate in the epidural space before compressing the brain and resulting in clinical deterioration. The length of the lucid interval depends on the severity of the trauma and the intensity of the bleeding and is typically shorter in patients with bleeding from the meningeal arteries compared to patients who bleed from a torn bridging vein (as seen with subdural hematomas).",

            "description": "Most epidural hematomas (EDH) are caused by a rupture/tear of the middle meningeal artery secondary to a traumatic head injury, typically associated with a skull fracture. The resulting hemorrhage separates the dura mater from the inner aspect of the calvarium and accumulates within the epidural space. As the dura mater is tightly adherent at the skull suture lines, an EDH does not extend beyond the sutures. An EDH would be seen on neuroimaging as a biconvex hyperdense lesion that does not cross the suture lines.",

The surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane was uneventful, lasting 98 minutes, during which the patient maintained oxygen saturation readings of 96–100% on 8 L of oxygen. She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 135/minute, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 9000/mm^3, a platelet count of 145,000/mm^3, and a creatine kinase of 190 U/L. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

While an atypical presentation with dyspnea is possible, especially in older patients, women, or patients with diabetes mellitus, the development of neurological abnormalities and a petechial rash in the setting of a borderline low platelet count suggests a different diagnosis. Additionally, in a patient with acute MI, the ECG is expected to show signs of ischemia (e.g., ST-elevations, ST-depression, T-wave inversion) rather than just sinus tachycardia.",

Rhabdomyolysis usually causes myalgia, generalized weakness, and darkened urine from excess myoglobin. While this patient has a slight increase in the creatine kinase (CK) level, it is likely induced by fracture-associated muscle trauma. Rhabdomyolysis may be suspected if the CK is ≥ 5 times the normal range, but levels often exceed 100,000 U/L. While this patient experienced trauma, she lacks the aforementioned symptoms, making rhabdomyolysis less likely. Acute dyspnea and altered mental status following a bone fracture suggest a different diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient presents with the classic triad of fat embolism (hypoxia, neurological abnormalities, and upper body petechial rash), which is thought to be caused by the entry of bone marrow fat cells into the circulatory system. Therefore, fat embolism most commonly occurs after fractures of marrow-containing bones, such as closed long bone and pelvic fractures. Symptoms usually develop within 12–72 hours of the inciting event. Neurological symptoms result either from paradoxical embolism or from fatty microemboli that are small enough to pass through the pulmonary circulation and enter the arterial circulation in the CNS. The petechial rash is caused by fatty occlusion of dermal capillaries with subsequent extravasation of erythrocytes. Fat embolism is mainly a clinical diagnosis, and treatment consists of supportive care (e.g., supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors) in an intensive care unit.\n\nIn addition to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and fever, patients may present with other nonspecific features such as lipiduria, hypotension, and right ventricle dysfunction.",

While this patient is febrile, the rise in body temperature in patients with malignant hyperthermia is usually much more dramatic, sometimes at a rate of 1–2°C every 5 minutes, often exceeding 42°C. Although this patient has a slight increase in the creatine kinase (CK) level, it is likely induced by the fracture-associated muscle trauma, rather than rhabdomyolysis secondary to malignant hyperthermia. In malignant hyperthermia, CK levels usually exceed 10,000 U/L.

She did not lose consciousness. She has a mild headache over the left temple and severe left hip pain. She has had nasal congestion, a sore throat, and a productive cough for the last 2 days. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and osteoporosis. She underwent two coronary artery bypass grafts 5 years ago. Her current medications include aspirin, apixaban, diltiazem, omeprazole, and vitamin D supplementation. The patient is oriented to person, place, and time. There is a 2-cm ecchymosis over the left temple. Examination of the left hip shows swelling and tenderness; range of motion is limited. Intravenous morphine 2 mg is started. During further examination, the patient complains of dizziness and palpitations. She is diaphoretic and pale. Her skin is cold and clammy. Her pulse is 110/min and faint, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Cranial nerves are intact. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. An ECG shows absent P waves and nonspecific changes of the ST segment and the T wave. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's sudden decline in her condition?",

In addition, while tachycardia and nonspecific ST-wave changes may be the only ECG changes seen in PE, signs of right heart strain (e.g., right axis deviation, right bundle branch block, S1Q3T3-pattern) are the more characteristic findings, especially in large PEs that could cause obstructive shock.",

These conditions are associated with absent or decreased breath sounds, whereas this patient's lungs are clear to auscultation.

While sprinting on the field, he slipped as he attempted to kick the ball and landed on the anterior aspect of his knee. He underwent an appendectomy at the age of 16 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a swollen and tender left knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The tibial tuberosity shows tenderness to palpation. The left tibia is displaced posteriorly when force is applied to the proximal tibia after flexing the knee. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the left knee joint shows an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

A positive posterior drawer sign is highly suggestive of PCL injury, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by MRI. Avulsion fractures are common in PCL injury. Isolated PCL injury can be treated conservatively; multiligament injuries and/or chronic symptoms typically warrant surgery.\n\nPatients with PCL injury sometimes appear to have a positive anterior drawer sign because the affected knee seems to have significantly more anterior movement compared to the unaffected knee (due to starting from a posteriorly displaced position).",

It contains multiple areas of intermediate signal intensity, indicating tearing. A joint effusion is demonstrated by the hyperintense signal in the suprapatellar pouch (red overlay).A ligament tear does not always appear as a discrete defect and may be demonstrated by the features in this example. A normal PCL should appear as hypointense on all conventional MRI sequences and have smooth margins.",

His mother says that he did not lose consciousness but has been agitated and complaining about a headache since the event. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg. There is a large bruise on the anterior scalp and several superficial abrasions on both hands and knees. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. A noncontrast CT scan of the head shows a nondepressed linear skull fracture with a 2-mm separation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

On arrival, he is unconscious. His pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large-bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) results are negative. An ECG shows absent P waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "While hypotension following acute trauma should raise concern for blood loss, this patient's negative FAST exam makes intraabdominal or intrathoracic bleeding less likely. Instead, his profound hypotension despite an apparently normal volume status, the bibasilar lung crackles, and elevated jugular venous pressure potentially indicate cardiogenic shock.",

        "explanation_why": "In the context of a serious motor vehicle collision, this patient's hypotension and tachycardia refractive to fluid resuscitation, including vasopressors, combined with atrial fibrillation on ECG and a negative FAST, are highly suspicious for cardiac contusion. Cardiac contusions may manifest with clinical features ranging from asymptomatic arrhythmias to rapidly fatal cardiac rupture. Blunt chest trauma and/or sudden deceleration can lead to decreased contractility and arrhythmias due to injury to cardiac myocytes and pacemaker cells. Decreased contractility directly contributes to cardiogenic shock with decreased cardiac output and hypotension, as in this patient.",

It may also be associated with a raised jugular venous pressure. In severe cases of hemothorax, blood loss into the thoracic cavity can lead to hemorrhagic shock, with subsequent tachycardia and hypotension. However, a hemothorax is distinctly identifiable on chest x-ray or on ultrasound as part of the FAST exam. No signs of internal bleeding are apparent on this patient's FAST exam and the physical exam findings (bibasilar crackles, soft abdomen) make a significant hemothorax even more unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "An aortic dissection may occur as the result of rapid deceleration (e.g., in a motor vehicle accident) and typically manifests with severe tearing chest pain that may radiate to different parts of the body. Aortic dissection is associated with hypotension either if the dissection involves the ascending aorta resulting in cardiac tamponade and/or aortic regurgitation, or if it results in aortic rupture and hemorrhage into the mediastinum. On the FAST exam, however, aortic rupture would be apparent as free fluid above the diaphragm, with secondary cardiac tamponade as fluid accumulates in the pericardium. Moreover, secondary aortic regurgitation severe enough to affect the patient's vitals would be heard on auscultation.",

Symptoms may then worsen following fluid administration as fluid accumulates in the damaged lung. While this patient does have chest pain and tachypnea and deteriorated after receiving fluids, pulmonary contusion would be less likely to cause the arrhythmia or fluid- and vasopressor-resistant hypotension that proved fatal in this patient.",

        "explanation_why": "Paralysis of the wrist flexors and intrinsic hand muscles is seen in Klumpke palsy. This condition is typically caused by traumatic injury to the C8 and T1 nerve roots that form the lower trunk of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus and its trunks lie more proximal than the nerve typically injured during a shoulder dislocation; therefore plexus injuries due to shoulder dislocation and reduction are exceedingly rare. In adults, Klumpke palsy most commonly occurs due to hyperabduction of the arm e.g., during an attempt to break a fall from a height by grabbing support.",

Signs of shaft fracture include severe local pain and swelling, deformity, crepitus, and shortening of the arm (if displacement is present). This patient's presentation is most consistent with anterior shoulder dislocation, in which radial nerve injury is uncommon. In addition, radial nerve injury is not a complication of closed shoulder reduction.",

        "explanation_why": "Axillary nerve injury (ANI) is the most common nerve injury in shoulder dislocation because of the close proximity of the axillary nerve to the humeral head. ANI also rarely occurs as a complication of closed reduction, which is the first-line treatment for most patients with shoulder dislocation. Typical manifestations of ANI include decreased sensation over the lateral shoulder and impaired abduction and external rotation of the arm. In shoulder dislocation, impaired abduction and external rotation may occur because of mechanical reasons and are not necessarily a sign of ANI. Because ANI has a high rate of spontaneous recovery, patients are initially managed conservatively following closed reduction and immobilization to treat shoulder dislocation.\n\nOther complications of shoulder dislocation include axillary artery and vein injury, fractures of the shoulder joint, and rotator cuff tears, all of which rarely also occur as a complication of reduction procedures.",

He is brought to the combat medic by his unit for a primary survey. The soldier reports shortness of breath. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His pulse is 99/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm wound at the left fourth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Bubbling of blood is seen with each respiration at the wound site. There is no jugular venous distention. There is hyperresonance to percussion and decreased breath sounds on the left side. The trachea is at the midline. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "The presence of dyspnea and tachypnea with decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion after a penetrating chest wound with bubbling of blood indicates an open pneumothorax. The absence of hemodynamic instability, tracheal deviation, and jugular venous distention make a tension pneumothorax unlikely.",

        "content": "Partially occlusive dressing",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "A partially occlusive dressing (such as clear plastic film taped at 3 out of 4 sides of the lesion) is a temporary treatment for open pneumothorax, used to prevent further expansion of the pneumothorax until the diagnosis has been confirmed and definitive treatment is available. This dressing creates a flutter valve effect (i.e., air is free to escape from the gap in the dressing during exhalation while the dressing occludes the wound during inhalation), preventing the entry of further air via the wound into the thoracic cavity. Once the patient has been fully stabilized, a chest tube would be placed for definitive treatment of his pneumothorax. The tube should be placed through intact skin in one of the recommended anatomical locations, not through the preexisting injury.\n\nChest tubes alone are sufficient treatment for pneumothorax in ∼ 85% of cases; surgery is required for the remainder.",

Her pulse is 140/min, respirations are 12/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography shows blood in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.6 g/dL and hematocrit is 22%. The surgeon decides to move the patient to the operating room for an emergency explorative laparotomy. Packed red blood cell transfusion is ordered prior to surgery. A friend of the patient asks for the transfusion to be held as the patient is a Jehovah's Witness. The patient has no advance directive and there is no documentation showing her refusal of blood transfusions. The patient's husband and children cannot be contacted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Knee swelling and pain are also commonly seen in this condition. Contact injury involving valgus stress on the knee, such as a tackle from the side, is the mechanism that most commonly causes MCL injury.\n\nMCL injury is frequently associated with a medial meniscus tear, which can be assessed on physical exam. In this case, the remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities, which makes a concurrent meniscus injury less likely.",

On arrival, he is alert and oriented. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There is a 3-cm laceration over the forehead and multiple bruises over the trunk. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The right knee is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun and intravenous acetaminophen is administered. Two hours later, blood-tinged fluid spontaneously drains from both nostrils and is made worse by leaning forward. On a piece of gauze, it shows up as a rapidly expanding clear ring of fluid surrounding blood. Further evaluation of this patient over the next 24 hours is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

        "explanation_why": "Basilar skull fracture can be associated with cranial nerve palsies. Anterior basilar skull fracture can cause cranial nerve (CN) I palsies, as well as palsies in CN V, VI, VII, or VIII. However, CN XII exits the skull at the hypoglossal canal of the occipital bone (in the posterior fossa) and thus is associated with posterior basilar skull fractures, not anterior basilar skull fractures. Additionally, most cranial nerve palsies associated with basilar skull fracture are not present until 1–3 days after injury, because the palsy is the result of compression or contusion of the nerve, which does not occur acutely. If a nerve is transected by trauma (which is uncommon), then the palsy would be present immediately.",

The disease most commonly manifests between 50 and 70 years of age, often beginning with unilateral weakness in the hands or feet, which then progresses to the contralateral side (asymmetric limb weakness). However, initial manifestations are highly variable and individuals may have atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as subtle vocal changes. As the disease progresses, most individuals eventually develop one or both of the life-threatening symptoms: respiratory impairment and dysphagia.",

Patients experience a symmetric cape-like distribution of pain and temperature sensory loss around the upper trunk, shoulders, and upper limbs. Vibration and position sense are selectively spared because fibers of the posterior columns decussate higher up in the medulla. As syringomyelia progresses, lower motor neuron weakness develops symmetrically in the upper limbs (evident by hand weakness, areflexia, and fasciculations in this patient) because the fluid-filled cavity begins to compress the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord at the level of the lesion. As the lesion expands, patients develop an upper motor neuron palsy of the lower extremities and lower half of the trunk (due to involvement of the corticospinal tracts), as well as complete sensory loss below the level of the lesion (including loss of vibration and position sense). However, sensations around the sacral region are usually spared.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination ↓ CO, ↑ PCWP, ↑ SVR, and ↑ CVP is characteristic of cardiogenic shock. If the heart is unable to pump adequately, CO decreases. Blood then “backs up” into the left atrium (LA), causing increased LA pressure (and thus ↑ PCWP). Increased LA pressure leads to increased right heart pressures, causing high CVP. Decreased CO leads to hypotension, so the peripheral vasculature constricts (↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure for organ perfusion. This patient has no history to suggest pump dysfunction (e.g., history of heart failure or arrhythmia), so this form of shock is unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↓ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↑ SVR, and ↓ CVP is characteristic of hypovolemic shock. Hemorrhage (e.g., after sustaining a gunshot wound) leads to intravascular volume depletion, which decreases blood return to the right atrium (as evidenced by ↓ CVP). Low right heart blood volume results in decreased blood delivery to the left atrium (shown by ↓ PCWP), and consequently low left ventricular end-diastolic volume (i.e., decreased preload), which in turn causes decreased CO. Low CO leads to hypotension, so the peripheral vasculature constricts (↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure for organ perfusion.\n\nThe treatment of choice for hypovolemic shock is correction of the underlying cause (e.g., hemostatic control in cases of hemorrhage) and intravascular volume repletion with IV fluids. Vasopressors are not beneficial in hypovolemic shock because the SVR is already elevated.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↓ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↓ SVR, and ↓ CVP is seen in some cases of distributive shock (especially neurogenic shock). Neurogenic shock typically results from severe CNS trauma (e.g., spinal cord transection) and is associated with other neurologic abnormalities (e.g., paralysis). Neurogenic shock is believed to result from loss of autonomic control of cardiovascular parameters due to CNS damage. Heart rate is characteristically low in neurogenic shock (likely due to excessive vagal tone), which leads to decreased CO. SVR is low due to peripheral vasodilation due to loss of sympathetic tone. Peripheral vasodilation causes decreased venous return to the heart, leading to low CVP and consequently low left atrial pressure (and PCWP). This patient has no history or physical findings suggestive of neurologic injury and she is tachycardic on examination. Another form of shock is more likely.",

In most forms of obstructive shock, blood flow from the right heart to the left heart is blocked, so blood “backs up” into the right atrium, causing increased CVP. Insufficient blood is delivered to the left atrium (LA), leading to decreased LA pressure (and thus ↓ PCWP), and little preload for the left ventricle (causing ↓ CO). Low CO results in hypotension, which induces peripheral vascular constriction (and thus ↑ SVR) in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure. This patient's history of a gunshot to the abdomen with free fluid in the abdomen suggests a different form of shock.\n\nIn certain cases of obstructive shock (e.g., due to cardiac tamponade), PCWP can also be increased.",

        "explanation_why": "The combination of ↑ CO, ↓ PCWP, ↓ SVR, and ↓ CVP is seen in some cases of distributive shock (e.g., early septic shock). Distributive shock is classically referred to as warm shock, because there is inappropriate peripheral vasodilation (causing ↓ CVP, ↓ SVR, and thus ↓ PCWP) and increased CO leading to excessive blood delivery to the limbs, resulting in inappropriately warm limbs in a hypotensive patient. This patient's limbs are cool, which indicates appropriate peripheral vasoconstriction in an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure. This patient has no history of infection and presents in hyperacute shock after penetrating trauma, which suggests an alternative shock physiology.",

Unstable fractures, such as trimalleolar and most bimalleolar ankle fractures, require strong fixation, which can be achieved with ORIF.

The ankle mortise has been disrupted. There is widening of the medial compartment (indicated by white arrow) and lateral displacement of the talus (indicated by a black arrow). A lateral view (not included here) showed a fracture of the posterior malleolus.The findings indicate an unstable trimalleolar fracture that requires operative treatment.

The affected leg is typically shortened, mildly flexed, internally rotated, and adducted. Given the considerable amount of force required for posterior hip dislocation, associated fractures of the femoral head or the acetabulum are common.\n\nHip dislocation is diagnosed with the help of an AP view x-ray of the hip. In the case of posterior hip dislocation, the femoral head on the dislocated side usually appears smaller than the normal side, the lesser trochanter may not be visible as a result of internal hip joint rotation, and Shenton's line is typically disrupted.",

His wife confirms that he has hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic lower back pain. Current medications include metoprolol, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and oxycodone. On arrival, he is lethargic and confused. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 172/78 mm Hg. The eyes open spontaneously. The pupils are equal and sluggish. He moves his extremities in response to commands. There is a 3-cm scalp laceration. There are multiple bruises over the right upper extremity. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters are inserted. A 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography in trauma is negative. Plain CT of the brain shows a 5-mm right subdural hematoma with no mass effect. Fresh frozen plasma is administered. Which of the following is most likely to reduce this patient's cerebral blood flow?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Reducing this patient's cerebral blood flow can lower intracranial pressure (ICP) but also lead to ischemia. Cerebral autoregulation is controlled by the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO_2).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Hyperventilation blows off CO_2, which lowers PaCO_2 levels and results in arterial smooth muscle constriction. Based on Poiseuille's law, small decreases in the arterial radius from vasoconstriction can profoundly decrease cerebral blood flow. Since the cranial vault has a finite amount of space, decreasing cerebral blood flow allows more room for brain tissue and reductions in ICP.\n\nAlthough hyperventilation was commonly used to reduce ICP, studies have failed to show long-term outcome advantages. Prophylactic hyperventilation is no longer recommended and should only be used as a temporary measure for elevated ICP refractory to medical therapy.",

This reduction in intracranial pressure can improve cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow. However, this technique is controversial, as the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy in traumatic brain injury is unclear and would not be the most appropriate first step in management for this patient.",

This technique is most commonly used to lower ICP in patients with hydrocephalus (e.g., normal pressure hydrocephalus). However, lumbar puncture is contraindicated in any patient with increased intracranial pressure due to brain swelling, as CSF removal can release pressure in the lower spinal cord causing downward brain herniation and death.",

        "explanation_why": "Hypertonic saline increases blood osmolality, which draws water from brain tissue into the intravascular space and thereby reduces ICP. Decreases in ICP can increase cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow by creating more space for vessels. Unless there is evidence of brain herniation, hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with confirmed increases in ICP.",

        "explanation_why": "Mannitol acts by rapidly expanding circulating blood volume and decreasing blood viscosity. This causes an increase in cerebral blood flow and the subsequent compensatory cerebral vasoconstriction results in an initial fall in ICP. After about 15–30 minutes, it further increases cerebral blood flow by increasing cerebral perfusion pressure. Because prolonged mannitol therapy can increase ICP, it should only be used in the acute phase in patients with signs of significant increases in ICP (e.g., mass effect, impending brain herniation).",

She was riding a bike when she lost control and hit a car on the opposite side of the road. On arrival, she is unconscious. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. Her pulse is 56/min, respirations are 8/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 196/85 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm laceration over the left cheek and a 3-cm laceration over the left chest. There are multiple abrasions over her face and chest. She opens her eyes and flexes her extremities to painful stimuli. The pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light. There are decreased breath sounds over the left lung. The trachea is central. There is no jugular venous distention. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The left knee and right ankle are swollen; range of motion is limited. Two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters are inserted. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is initiated. A focused assessment with sonography in trauma is negative. An occlusive dressing is applied over the left chest wound. She is scheduled for a noncontrast CT scan of the brain. Which of the following is the underlying cause of this patient's hypertension?",

The sympathetic nervous system is activated in order to maintain CPP by increasing systolic blood pressure, which explains this patient's hypertension and widening pulse pressure. The increased arterial pressure stimulates aortic arch baroreceptors that activate the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in bradycardia. A further increase in ICP leads to brain stem compression, which further promotes bradycardia and causes dysfunction of the respiratory center (bradypnea and irregular breathing).\n\nClinical features of elevated ICP warrant urgent neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to evaluate for intracerebral pathologies and guide further treatment, and potentially invasive ICP monitoring to confirm the diagnosis.",

He says the symptoms started after he had a tonic-clonic seizure. He has autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. There is no family history of serious illness. His current medications include sodium valproate and levetiracetam. He appears uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows that the left arm is adducted and internally rotated. The anterior left shoulder is flattened with prominence of the coracoid process. The right upper extremity shows no abnormalities. Sensation over the lateral surface of both shoulders is normal. Radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. Oropharyngeal examination shows a tongue laceration. An anteroposterior view x-ray of this patient's left shoulder and arm is most likely to show which of the following?",

As the humeral head dislocates posteriorly, it is forced into internal rotation and appears circular, producing a contour resembling a lightbulb on anteroposterior (AP) view x-ray. Other findings suggestive of posterior shoulder dislocation include the rim sign, trough line, reverse Hill-Sachs defect, and reverse Bankart lesion. Uncomplicated posterior dislocations should be managed conservatively with closed reduction.\n\nAP, scapular Y view, and axillary view x-rays are typically obtained for a suspected posterior shoulder dislocation. However, in some cases, a posterior dislocation may not be detected on AP view, therefore, an axillary lateral view is preferred for diagnosis.",

The FDP, along with the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), is responsible for finger flexion. The tendons from the FDP muscle run through the carpal tunnel and insert on the palmar side of the distal phalanges of each finger, whereas the FDS tendons insert on the middle phalanx. This patient's inability to flex the DIP combined with the pain over the DIP joint, which is distal to the attachment of the FDS, indicate that he has ruptured his FDP tendon.",

However, rather than causing symptoms to one specific nerve root, TOS usually compresses the lower trunk (C8–T1 nerve roots) of the brachial plexus. In a patient with TOS, Spurling's test would not recreate the patient's symptoms because the test is relatively specific for damage/irritation of the cervical nerve roots rather than the brachial plexus. Furthermore, TOS often affects vascular structures as well; patients present with arm pallor, coldness, decreased pulses, and/or cyanosis of the affected extremity, none of which is present in this patient.",

            "description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the entire motor neuron system (degeneration of the upper motor neuron in the precentral gyrus and lower motor neuron in the brainstem or anterior horn of the spinal cord). The disease most commonly manifests between 50 and 70 years of age, often beginning with unilateral weakness in the hands or feet, which then progresses to the contralateral side (asymmetric limb weakness). However, initial manifestations are highly variable and individuals may have atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as subtle vocal changes. As the disease progresses, most individuals eventually develop one or both of the life-threatening symptoms: respiratory impairment and dysphagia.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has cervical radiculopathy, most likely from a C5–C6 spinal disk herniation. Her radiating pain and paresthesias are caused by damage and/or irritation of the C6 nerve root, which innervates the radial aspect of the forearm and the thumb. These symptoms are reproduced with Spurling's maneuver, which has a high specificity for cervical radiculopathy. This patient's weakness results from damage to the same nerve root, as C6 provides motor function to the wrist extensors. C6 nerve root damage is also causing the decreased brachioradialis reflex in this patient, as C6 supplies motor function to that muscle.\n\nOther possible causes of the patient's radiculopathy include cervical spondylosis or a tumor causing nerve root compression. Her neurologic symptoms may also be caused by infections that affect the peripheral nervous system such as herpes zoster and Lyme disease. The diagnostic workup includes MRI, which would show a laterally prolapsed disk with surrounding edema in the case of disk herniation.",

He was cycling downhill at approximately 30 miles per hour when he lost control at a curve in the road. He was wearing a helmet and did not lose consciousness. There is no personal history of serious illness and he takes no medications. On arrival, the patient is alert and oriented. He is placed on a backboard with a cervical collar around his neck. Pulse is 96/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple bruises over the forehead and right cheek. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There is a 2-cm laceration below the right ear. Both ear canals show no abnormalities. The right wrist is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is mild midline cervical spine tenderness as well as tenderness along the 2^nd and 3^rd ribs on the right side. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation. Neurological examination shows no focal findings. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) shows no free intraperitoneal fluid. Bedside chest x-ray shows a fracture of the 3^rd rib on the right side and no other abnormalities. ECG is normal. Two peripheral venous catheters are placed. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

A CT scan of the cervical spine is the preferred imaging modality to rule out cervical spine injury in adult trauma patients.\n\nIf none of the NEXUS criteria are present, the risk of cervical spine injury is low, meaning that imaging is not indicated and the cervical collar can be removed.",

Although this patient has signs of potential wrist fracture (wrist pain, tenderness, limited range of motion), more severe injuries must be ruled out first. The patient's wrist will eventually require imaging and treatment. In trauma resuscitation, management of nonlethal injuries such as a wrist fracture is often deferred until all life threats are stabilized.

    "question_text": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after he was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, he is lethargic. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 10/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 94/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. He withdraws his extremities to pain. There are multiple bruises over his face, chest, and abdomen. Breath sounds are decreased over the left lung base. Two large bore peripheral venous catheters are inserted, and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Rapid sequence intubation is initiated, and orotracheal intubation via direct laryngoscopy is attempted three times without success. A laryngeal mask airway insertion also fails. Despite continuous bag-valve-mask ventilation, pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84%. The patient has no advance directive, and family members have not arrived. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Video laryngoscopy allows for visualization of the oropharynx and is commonly used to facilitate orotracheal intubation in patients with a difficult airway. Although video laryngoscopy could have been used earlier in the management of this patient, several intubation attempts have been unsuccessful. Furthermore, his oxygen saturation is acutely dropping despite attempts at maintaining ventilation and oxygenation through bag-valve and laryngeal masks. If establishing an alternative airway via video laryngoscopy is unsuccessful, hypoxic brain injury may occur. Another step is more appropriate in an emergency setting.",

However, this technique is usually performed electively in the operating room under direct visualization of the pharynx with laryngoscopy. Nasopharyngeal intubation is time-consuming and is therefore inappropriate in a CICV scenario with declining oxygen saturation, which requires an emergency airway.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has just experienced major trauma and presents with signs of respiratory distress (respiratory rate of 10/min, oxygen saturation of 84%), neurological compromise (lethargy, sluggish pupils), and a compromised airway (decreased breath sounds over left hemithorax, rapid decrease in oxygen saturation). After unsuccessful attempts at securing the airway and ventilation via orotracheal intubation, laryngeal mask placement, and bag-mask ventilation, immediate action is required to prevent hypoxia. A surgical airway with cricothyrotomy should be established in patients who cannot be intubated and oxygenated. Cricothyrotomy is the preferred method in an emergency when rapid airway control is needed, especially in cases where intubation is unsuccessful, and other supraglottic airway devices are ineffective.",

He was thrown over the handlebars and hit the ground. He reports that he was wearing a helmet and that he did not lose consciousness. He has mild pain in his legs and on his right side but says that he feels well otherwise. On arrival, he is alert and oriented. His pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 110/76 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There are a few bruises over his right chest, flank, and lower extremities. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is tenderness to palpation over the right thorax. There is no pelvic instability. The external genitalia appear normal. Complete blood count, prothrombin time, and serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference ranges. A voided urine specimen is clear. Microscopic examination of the urine shows 85 RBCs/hpf. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma shows no free intra-abdominal fluid. An x-ray of the chest shows a fracture of the 11^th rib on the right side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Even if the brachial artery is not directly affected, local trauma can also induce brachial artery vasospasm, thus compromising arterial blood flow. Impaired brachial artery flow affects the distal structures supplied by this artery, so patients can have an absent or diminished radial pulse and delayed capillary refill in the affected arm. Most patients do not have a direct injury of the artery and treatment of the fracture (internal fixation) usually reduces entrapment and restores perfusion; vascular surgery is rarely needed.",

On arrival, his pulse is 105/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 115/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. An entrance wound is seen on the anteromedial surface of the right thigh 2 cm below the inguinal ligament; there is no active bleeding from the wound and no exit wound. No bruit or thrill is heard on auscultation. The pedal pulse is diminished on the right side compared to the left, and the ankle-brachial index is 0.7 for the right side. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows multiple abrasions over both lower extremities. There is swelling and tenderness of the right ankle; range of motion is limited by pain. Dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior pulses are palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the ankle shows an extra-articular calcaneal fracture. Intravenous analgesia is administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

After extrication, he had severe upper back pain and was unable to move his legs. On arrival, he is alert and fully oriented. His neck is immobilized in a cervical collar. His pulse is 58/min, respirations are 17/min and regular, and blood pressure is 89/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. He has flaccid paralysis and absent reflexes in the lower extremities. Sensory examination shows absent sensation below the level of the nipples including absent sensation in the perianal region. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft. Rectal examination discloses no discernable resting tone and squeezing of the glans penis does not elicit anal sphincter contraction. The remainder of the examination, including a focused assessment with sonography for trauma, shows no abnormalities. A whole-body CT scan reveals an isolated burst fracture of the T3 vertebra with no evidence of facet injury. In addition to intravenous fluid therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "This patient presents with spinal shock (flaccid, areflexic paralysis, anesthesia below the level of the injury) and neurogenic shock (bradycardia, hypotension) due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Absent sacral sparing in the spinal shock phase correlates with a high degree of autonomic dysfunction.",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with spinal shock and absent sacral sparing will have impaired micturition reflexes (often with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) and no bladder-filling sensation. This may result in acute urinary retention with painless bladder distension and subsequent complications (e.g., hydronephrosis, worsening bradycardia from bladder distention, bladder rupture). Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is the placement of a Foley catheter. Urinary catheterization also enables the assessment of fluid balance in patients who require careful intravenous fluid therapy for the management of neurogenic shock. When fluid therapy is no longer necessary, the indwelling catheter should be replaced by an intermittent catheter (ideally 3–4 days after the injury) to decrease the risk of urinary tract infection. Intermittent catheterization to decompress the bladder also prevents autonomic dysreflexia, a late complication of SCI above T6.\n\nOther important management steps in the management of SCI include venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, decubitus ulcer prophylaxis, pain control, and bowel care. Patients with SCI should undergo repeated, thorough neurological examinations with documentation of the findings. The return of any neurological function in the sacral segments after spinal shock resolves indicates an incomplete SCI and predicts the return of some degree of bowel and bladder control. The persistence of complete neurological impairment in the sacral segments after spinal shock resolves indicates complete SCI and a poor prognosis.",

Urgent surgical stabilization of the spine is typically performed if the patient has unstable injuries (e.g., bilateral facet dislocation), especially if the injury cannot be treated with closed reduction, or if the patient has progressively worsening neurological deficits. For a patient in neurogenic shock, medical management to limit spinal cord ischemia from hypoperfusion is more important before surgery is performed.",

She has also vomited twice in the past 2 hours. Her musculoskeletal pain due to the motor vehicle collision had been well controlled with acetaminophen every 6 hours but the medication provides no relief for the flank pain. She underwent umbilical hernia repair surgery 2 years ago. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 99/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 102/72 mm Hg. After administration of 0.5 L of crystalloid fluids, blood pressure improves to 118/79 mm Hg. Multiple ecchymoses are present over the anterior abdominal wall in a pattern that follows the course of a seatbelt and there are new ecchymoses over the flanks bilaterally. Bowel sounds are absent. There is tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants with voluntary guarding. Her hemoglobin is 7.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8500/mm^3, platelet count is 350,000/mm^3, prothrombin time is 11 seconds, and activated partial thromboplastin time is 33 seconds. An x-ray of the abdomen shows obliteration of the right psoas shadow, dilated bowel loops, and uniform distribution of gas in the small bowel, colon, and rectum without air-fluid levels. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",

It manifests with dyspnea and ipsilateral chest pain, as well as hemodynamic instability in the case of tension pneumothorax (due to mediastinal compression and decreased venous return). However, the physical examination in patients with pneumothorax typically shows reduced or absent breath sounds over the affected lung. Tension pneumothorax would also manifest with jugular venous distention rather than the flat neck veins seen in this patient.",

In children, the abdominal wall is thinner and less developed, and inner organs, especially the duodenum, take up a larger portion of the body relative to height, making them more prone to injury. Typical symptoms, such as epigastric pain, bilious emesis, and an upper abdominal mass, result from the associated small bowel obstruction. The absence of these symptoms in combination with the patient's age makes this diagnosis less likely.",

When the child tried to pull himself up on the dresser, it tipped and fell on his chest and abdomen. He had been awake and agitated at the scene and moved all extremities except for his right arm. On arrival, he is unconscious with rapid, shallow respirations. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 164/min and thready, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 68/35 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bony deformity of the right upper extremity and scattered ecchymoses over the chest and abdomen. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities except for tachycardia. The abdomen is distended with guarding and rebound tenderness; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Attempts to obtain venous access were not successful. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

However, this patient presents with signs of severe hypovolemia requiring immediate fluid resuscitation. Subclavian vein cannulation performed during emergencies is accompanied by a variety of complications such as hemothorax or pneumothorax. In addition, CVL insertion requires ultrasound guidance, which would consume valuable time in an emergency such as this. Lastly, since flow rates in CVLs are relatively low given the length of the catheter, a CVL is not the preferred access for emergency fluid resuscitation.",

However, obtaining peripheral venous access has already been attempted without success and the patient requires immediate fluid resuscitation. Particularly in pediatric trauma patients such as this one, peripheral IV access should be achieved within 60–90 seconds of arrival.

Neurogenic shock is a type of distributive shock characterized by generalized vasodilation (causing flushed skin). This vasodilation leads to decreased preload and subsequently reduced cardiac output, which results in severe hypotension. Bradycardia results from lack of beta-adrenergic activity and is exacerbated by unopposed parasympathetic tone (vagal tone). Consequently, cerebral perfusion is impaired, leading to loss of consciousness as seen in this patient. Treatment for neurogenic shock secondary to spinal anesthesia usually involves IV fluids and pressor therapy until the concentration of anesthetic agent has decreased adequately.\n\nSee “Overview of the types of shock” table.",

First responders found the patient sitting on the curb experiencing pain where he had been stabbed. On arrival at the hospital, he is alert. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows several 1–2 cm lacerations and ecchymoses over the face and trunk. There is no neck crepitus. A pocket knife is lodged in the fourth parasternal intercostal space and there is a small amount of blood oozing out of the wound. There is no bubbling of the blood at the wound. The lungs are clear to auscultation with equal breath sounds. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray shows the knife in situ extending into the right thorax. Both lungs appear normal; they are homogeneously aerated and have no abnormal opacities. Size and shape of the heart are within normal limits. No fractures or tracheal deviation are visible. Both hemidiaphragms and costophrenic angles are sharply demarcated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

        "explanation_why": "Impaled foreign bodies should be removed under direct visualization in the operating room. As the knife is still in situ, the exact extent of intrathoracic damage is unknown. Although this patient is currently hemodynamically stable, he could have sustained vascular damage that is masked by the knife tamponading the stab wound and preventing hemorrhage at this time. Upon removal of the knife, the patient could hemorrhage and rapidly deteriorate. Emergency surgery is indicated to remove the knife in an environment in which bleeding can be controlled. Therefore, this patient should undergo rapid sequence endotracheal intubation in anticipation of emergency surgery. In hemodynamically stable patients, some surgeons first use video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery to evaluate the situs and, if safe removal of the foreign body is not possible with this technique, proceed to open thoracotomy.",

The most common indication is laryngospasm, an obstruction that prevents less invasive airway management. While an emergency procedure is required to remove the in situ knife and manage the injuries, cricothyroidotomy is not the first choice for airway management in this patient because there is no evidence of laryngospasm (e.g., stridor, shortness of breath, tachypnea) and other interventions to secure the airways have not been attempted.",

EDT is primarily recommended for pulseless patients with signs of life (e.g., measurable blood pressure, spontaneous breathing) following penetrating thoracic trauma. This patient, however, is hemodynamically stable with only minor bleeding from his chest wound; therefore, there is no indication for resuscitative thoracotomy.

Incomplete fractures are more common in children due to their thicker, stronger periosteum and the greater elasticity of growing bones. Types of incomplete fractures include:Buckle (torus) fracture: A compressive force results in bulging, i.e., buckling of the cortex. More specifically, a buckle fracture is characterized by bulging of only one side of the cortex (the concave side), while a fracture in which the bulge is circumferential is referred to more precisely as a “torus fracture.” However, the terms are frequently used interchangeably.Greenstick fracture: There is discontinuity of the cortex and periosteum on the convex (tension) side of the fracture, but bending occurs only on the concave (compression) side.Bowing fracture: There is angulation but no discontinuity of the cortex or periosteum.",

He transitioned to pureed vegetables 10 days ago. Over the past 2 weeks, he has become increasingly irritable and within the past day has taken more daytime naps and appears much less responsive and interactive. His mother denies any history of fever or trauma at home. He has not received any vaccinations as his parents believe he is already healthy and does not need them. He spends most of the day with a babysitter while both parents are at work. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Auscultation of the heart and lungs shows no abnormalities. The anterior fontanelle is tense and bulging. Fundoscopic examination shows bilateral retinal hemorrhage. A complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 10,000/mm^3. An x-ray of the chest shows healing fractures of the 2^nd and 3^rd right ribs. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

However, increased intracranial pressure would more likely be associated with papilledema on fundoscopic examination than retinal hemorrhages.

Children who are septic from meningitis may also rarely present with retinal hemorrhages. However, bacterial meningitis typically presents more acutely, in a matter of hours or days. Additionally, this child is afebrile and has a normal white blood cell count, both of which are unexpected findings in children with meningitis, particularly in meningitis due to bacterial pathogens.",

Long-term deficits resulting from SBS include sight, hearing, and speech impairment. SBS has an extremely high mortality rate, with approx. 25% of affected children dying as a result of sustained injuries. Cranial CT scan in patients with SBS often shows additional brain injuries such as chronic subdural hematoma (which would explain this patient's subacute presentation over 2 weeks), subarachnoid bleeding, and/or diffuse punctate parenchymal hemorrhages.",

Examination shows severe tenderness to palpation over the lower abdomen and over the left anterior superior iliac spine. There is no limb length discrepancy. Application of downward pressure over the pelvis shows no springy resistance or instability. Rectal examination is unremarkable. There is no blood at the urethral meatus. Placement of a Foley catheter shows gross hematuria. A focused assessment with sonography shows no free fluid in the abdomen. An x-ray of the pelvis shows a stable fracture of the anterior pelvic ring. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

When GU trauma is suspected, the GU tract should be assessed, including the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys. Pelvic fractures in combination with gross hematuria should raise concern for bladder injury. Retrograde cystography (or retrograde CT cystography) is the preferred diagnostic test in patients with suspected bladder rupture. Extravasation of contrast on retrograde cystography confirms the diagnosis.",

Renal trauma can also manifest with hematuria and should be suspected in patients with associated injuries (e.g., rib fractures) or pain and hematoma over the flank.

    "question_text": "A 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a whistling sound during respiration for the past 3 weeks. He reports that the whistling is becoming louder, and is especially loud when he exercises. He says the noise is frustrating for him. Two months ago, the patient underwent outpatient treatment for an uncomplicated nasal fracture after being hit in the nose by a high-velocity stray baseball. Since the accident, the patient has been taking aspirin for pain. He has a history of asymptomatic nasal polyps.

Which of the following would have prevented the whistling during respiration?",
    "content_preview": "A 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a whistling sound during respiration for the past 3 weeks. He reports that the whistling is becoming louder, and is especially loud when he exercises. He says the noise is frustrating for him. Two months ago, the patient underwent outpatient treatment for an uncomplicated nasal fracture after being hit in the nose by a high-velocity stray baseball. Since the accident, the patient has been taking aspirin for pain. He has a history of asymptomatic nasal polyps. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following would have prevented the whistling during respiration?",

        "explanation_why": "Nasal septal perforation may develop as a sequela of septal hematoma secondary to a nasal fracture. The hematoma disrupts blood flow to the septal cartilage, resulting in ischemia, necrosis, and subsequent perforation. Analgesics with antiplatelet activity such as aspirin should be avoided 48 hours after nasal trauma or surgery as they may precipitate the development of septal hematoma. This patient's prolonged pain after nasal injury may also be a sign of complications such as nasal hematoma and perforation. If a nasal septal hematoma is present, aspiration and drainage should be performed immediately to reduce pressure on the cartilage and prevent complications.\n\nWhistling typically resolves with the placement of a silicone button prosthesis.",

Blood pressure is therefore underestimated. If more fluid were administered to the patient based on a misinterpretation of blood pressure, edema in the limb would worsen, and the risk of pulmonary edema would increase. Also, blood pressure may be normal despite decreased intravascular fluid volume and end-organ perfusion in a patient with an intact vasomotor response and would only begin to decrease once shock sets in. Even intraarterial manometry may be unreliable because of peripheral vasoconstriction by stress hormones (e.g., catecholamines).",

Maintaining organ perfusion is the primary goal of IV fluid therapy in burn patients. Initially, the approximate volume of fluid required may be estimated (e.g., based on the total body surface area involved), however, this is merely a starting point, and IV fluid volume should be titrated to maintain a urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/h in adults (1 mL/kg/h in children). Although heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored in patients with burns, these parameters are not good indicators of overall organ perfusion. If urine output falls below 0.5 mL/kg/h, a 500–1000 mL bolus of crystalloid fluid should be given, and the maintenance infusion rate should be increased by 20–30%.",

However, CES typically manifests with asymmetric muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, and saddle anesthesia due to damage of the lower motor neurons, which is not consistent with this patient's symmetric muscle weakness and hyperreflexia. In addition, bowel and bladder dysfunction are late findings of CES and would not be expected within hours of injury. Lastly, because of nerve root compression, the pain usually radiates along the sensory distribution of the nerves affected.",

Following discharge, this patient should be monitored by a responsible individual for at least 24 hours after injury and return to the ED if there are any neurological changes. Patients should also progress through six stages of a gradual return to sports. As each stage requires at least 24 hours, this patient will need to refrain from contact sports for at least one week.\n\nNeuroimaging is not routinely recommended for mild TBI.

The tumor can develop in any bone, but most commonly affects the metaphyses and diaphyses of long bones (e.g., femur, tibia, humerus) or the spine. The characteristic clinical feature is a persistent, intense, aching pain localized to the site of the lesion that worsens at night. Physical examination often shows pain on palpation that is not exacerbated by movement, unless intracapsular lesions occur. Since this patient has no history of pain at rest or at night, and extension/flexion elicits pain, osteoid osteoma is unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "Traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle occurs in Osgood Schlatter disease, which typically affects adolescent athletes. Overuse (e.g., sports that involve running and jumping) leads to the patellar tendon exerting excessive strain on the tibial tuberosity, which is not yet fully ossified in adolescents and is thus susceptible to detachment. Patients typically present with anterior knee pain localized to the tibial tubercle. Visible swelling of the proximal tibia may also be present. X-ray is usually not required for diagnosis, but may be helpful to rule out differential diagnoses, especially in cases of atypical presentation (e.g., history of trauma, nocturnal pain, pain at rest). This patient's age, history, and x-ray findings of fragmentation and irregularity of the tibial tubercle are all indicative of Osgood Schlatter disease.\n\nOsgood Schlatter disease is usually self-limited. Treatment is therefore primarily conservative, consisting of rest, ice, stretching exercises, and NSAIDs.",

The condition manifests with diffuse joint pain during activities and progressive joint stiffness with locking or catching of the joint. On physical examination, range of motion is intact, though palpation of the femoral condyles in the flexed knee elicits pain. OCD can be ruled out since this patient presents with pain over the proximal tibial and not the femoral condyles. Moreover, patients with OCD would have a crescent-shaped radiolucency on the medial femoral condyle, whereas this patient's abnormality is on the tibial tuberosity.",

This patient's reduced movement of the left upper extremity is most likely a manifestation of pseudoparalysis, not true brachial plexus injury, especially since his hand movement is normal. Decreased ipsilateral extremity movement is believed to take strain off the clavicle and reduce discomfort for the child.

To reduce discomfort, the patient's sleeve can be pinned to the front of their shirt with the arm flexed at 90 degrees. Analgesics may also be considered. After 2 weeks, proper healing should be confirmed either via clinical examination (palpable callus formation) or x-ray. The condition usually self-resolves within 2–3 weeks, and long-term complications are not expected.\n\nNeonatal clavicle fracture is most often a clinical diagnosis but an x-ray can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Radial head subluxation is the most common elbow injury in children < 5 years of age. It results from sudden traction on the outstretched and pronated arm (e.g., from spinning a child by the hand). The diagnosis is usually made clinically; radiologic imaging is generally not indicated if the patient presents with a typical history and clinical features (i.e., arm held in a flexed and pronated position and tenderness on supination). Treatment consists of closed, manual reduction by forced hyperpronation of the forearm. If hyperpronation is unsuccessful, supination of the forearm with the elbow in flexion can be attempted (under certain circumstances, this supination-flexion technique may be attempted first). Following successful reduction, there is typically immediate pain relief. Reduction can be confirmed if clinical control shows a normal range of motion of the elbow.",

    "question_text": "A 65-year-old African American woman comes to the physician because of severe lower back pain. She has had dull lower back pain for several months, which suddenly became sharp in nature after lifting a heavy bucket of water 2 days ago. The pain is midline and does not radiate. She has had frequent vaginal dryness and hot flashes since menopause at the age of 55 years, for which she is on hormone replacement therapy. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hypothyroidism. Her other medications include hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and levothyroxine. She attends a 30-minute power walking class twice a week. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. She does not drink alcohol. She does not appear in distress. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lb); her BMI is 28 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows midline lumbar tenderness. Muscle strength is full and deep tendon reflexes are 2+. Straight leg raising is negative but painful. MRI of the spine shows an acute compression fracture of the L3 vertebral body and an old compression fracture of the L4 vertebra. Which of the following factors in this patient's history is the strongest predisposing factor for her condition?",

She has had dull lower back pain for several months, which suddenly became sharp in nature after lifting a heavy bucket of water 2 days ago. The pain is midline and does not radiate. She has had frequent vaginal dryness and hot flashes since menopause at the age of 55 years, for which she is on hormone replacement therapy. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hypothyroidism. Her other medications include hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and levothyroxine. She attends a 30-minute power walking class twice a week. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. She does not drink alcohol. She does not appear in distress. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lb); her BMI is 28 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows midline lumbar tenderness. Muscle strength is full and deep tendon reflexes are 2+. Straight leg raising is negative but painful. MRI of the spine shows an acute compression fracture of the L3 vertebral body and an old compression fracture of the L4 vertebra. Which of the following factors in this patient's history is the strongest predisposing factor for her condition?",

This syndrome is characterized by retropatellar or peripatellar pain that worsens with activity (e.g., ascending and descending stairs) or after a period of prolonged sitting. The etiology is not definitively known but is thought to be caused by multiple factors, including overuse and malalignment of the knee joint. Treatment includes exercises to strengthen the quadriceps muscle.\n\nThe patellar grind test is not particularly helpful in diagnosing patellofemoral pain syndrome and may cause unnecessary pain for the patient.",

However, this condition typically develops in a younger population (9–14 years of age) and is more common among boys (especially boys who recently experienced a growth spurt). In addition, Osgood-Schlatter disease usually causes proximal tibial swelling.

However, the pain caused by this syndrome is typically located on the lateral aspect of the knee near the lateral femoral condyle (the insertion site of the iliotibial band). In addition, the pain does not worsen with prolonged sitting but tends to be worse at the beginning of and during exercise.

In addition, this patient's knee pain worsens with sitting and is exacerbated by anterior patellar pressure; these findings are not typical features of reactive arthritis.",

        "explanation_why": "Patellar tendinitis is common among young athletes, especially those involved in sports that require frequent jumping (e.g., volleyball, basketball) and typically manifests with pain located on the anterior aspect of the knee which worsens with prolonged sitting and ascending and descending stairs. However, the pain is elicited when applying pressure to the inferior aspect of the knee cap or the tibial tuberosity (where the patellar tendon attaches to the tibia). Moreover, pressure on the knee cap during quadriceps activation does not typically recreate the pain.",

Signs and symptoms of ductal injury may resemble those of acute pancreatitis and may likewise take several days to manifest. This explains the often delayed presentation and diagnosis of pancreatic injuries such as laceration, contusion, or rupture. Although a CT scan is a key imaging modality in patients with blunt abdominal trauma, it has poor sensitivity for early detection of traumatic pancreatic injuries.",

    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "The patient's findings of enophthalmos (posteriorly displaced eye) and infraorbital rim tenderness are suggestive of an orbital floor fracture (orbital blowout fracture). The mechanism of this injury can lead to downward displacement of orbital fat and inferior rectus muscle entrapment, which in turn can cause impaired upward gaze.",

Fracture of the maxillary bone in this portion of the medial orbital rim can also result in disruption of the medial canthal ligament, causing eyelid displacement and entrapment of the medial rectus muscle, which would prevent horizontal eye movement. Nasoethmoid fractures are the second most common orbital fractures after orbital floor fractures, but this patient has none of the accompanying signs, and such a fracture would not explain his limited upward gaze or inferior orbital rim tenderness.",

        "explanation_why": "Pneumatization of the frontal sinus is a part of normal development as bone marrow in the frontal sinuses is slowly replaced by air starting at 2 years of age until adolescence. Pneumatization of the frontal sinuses may also occur as a result of orbital trauma in cases of orbital roof fractures. These fractures are rare in adults because of the strength of the orbital roof. They are more common in children, who have a higher cranium-to-midface ratio relative to adults. Orbital roof fractures result in CSF leaks and mucocele formation, none of which are present in this patient.",

When CSF leak does occur, it is typically due to an orbital roof fracture with extension to the frontal sinuses.

Fracture of the maxillary bone in this portion of the orbital rim could also result in disruption of the lacrimal duct system and entrapment of the medial rectus muscle, which would prevent horizontal eye movement. While these nasoethmoid fractures are the second most common orbital fractures after orbital floor fractures, this patient has normal horizontal eye movement, and such a fracture would not explain his limited upward gaze or inferior orbital rim tenderness.",

As a result of this shunt, systemic vascular resistance decreases, which, in turn, results in an increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. However, despite increased cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance results in arterial underfilling, decreased renal perfusion, and retention of water and salt, which leads to volume overload and heart failure.",

        "explanation_why": "A > 10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration is known as pulsus paradoxus, and is a sign observed in pathologies such as severe asthma, tension pneumothorax, constrictive pericarditis, and moderate and severe cardiac tamponade. In cardiac tamponade, the outward expansion of the right ventricle is limited, especially as blood flows during inspiration. This effect causes the interventricular septum to bulge into the left ventricle and together with a reduction in left ventricular filling causes a decrease in stroke volume as well as a subsequent drop in blood pressure.",

Through eccentric contraction, this type of activity especially strains the posterior rotator cuff when slowing down after releasing the ball. Tendon overload can cause microscopic tears called microinjuries. The relatively avascular nature of tendons means that these microinjuries have limited healing potential and can propagate into partial or full-thickness tears, or tendinopathy. The infraspinatus muscle, along with the teres minor muscle, is responsible for the external rotation of the humerus.

Inferior rib fractures (10–12^th ribs) are commonly associated with solid organ injuries to the liver, spleen, and/or kidneys. This patient has sustained a fracture of the posterior aspect of the left 12^th rib as is evident from the tenderness over his back and the x-ray findings, which makes a kidney laceration the most likely associated injury.\n\nLeft lower rib fractures also commonly cause splenic injury (including splenic rupture) due to the proximity of the posterior surface of the spleen to the left 9^th, 10^th, and 11^th ribs.

The patient here is unstable with hypotension and tachycardia, so the pneumothorax should be decompressed as quickly as possible. Since the neurovascular bundle runs below each rib, the upper edge of the rib is the preferred puncture site to help mitigate the risk of excessive bleeding and nerve damage. Emergency needle thoracostomy should be followed by chest tube placement in the 5^th intercostal space along the midaxillary line.\n\nAccording to the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, the 2^nd left intercostal space along the midclavicular line is no longer the preferred needle insertion site for emergency decompression of a tension pneumothorax in adults. This location is associated with high failure rates because of increased anterior chest wall thickness. Instead, placing the needle in the 5^th left intercostal space along the midaxillary line is preferable.",

Given this patient's history of progressively worsening left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath, pneumothorax should be considered as a possible diagnosis. A tension pneumothorax can cause tracheal deviation away from the affected side, due to increased intrathoracic pressure. However, x-ray findings in pneumothorax would include absent lung markings and areas of increased radiolucency rather than the large opacity and air-fluid level seen here.",

Trauma to the chest can cause the ribs to pierce the pleura and damage intrathoracic vessels, which can lead to accumulation of blood in the pleural space. There is tracheal deviation to the opposite side due to the increasing volume in the pleural space. A hemothorax cannot be diagnosed with x-ray alone (diagnosis usually requires CT imaging or thoracentesis) but given the patient's recent trauma, this is the most likely etiology.",

In view of the trauma history, the likely causes are pulmonary contusion and hemothorax. The slightly high position of the gastric bubble (GB) also suggests the presence of left lower lobe atelectasis.

        "explanation_why": "Post-traumatic syringomyelia can occur months to years after whiplash-type injury to the neck and presents with the classical findings of a central cord syndrome. Patients develop a symmetric cape-like distribution of pain and temperature sensory loss around the upper trunk, shoulders and upper limbs. Vibration and position sense are selectively spared because fibers of the posterior columns decussate higher up in the medulla. As syringomyelia progresses, lower motor neuron weakness develops symmetrically in the upper limbs (evident by areflexia and fasciculations in this patient) because the fluid-filled cavity begins to compress the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord at the level of the lesion. Syringomyelia is commonly associated with Chiari type I malformation.\n\nAs the lesion expands, the patient will develop an upper motor neuron palsy of the lower extremities and lower half of the trunk (due to involvement of the corticospinal tracts), as well as complete sensory loss below the level of the lesion (including loss of vibration and position sense). However, sensations around the sacral region will usually be spared.",

However, initial manifestations are highly variable and individuals may have atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as subtle vocal changes.

If a patient has a posterior sag sign from their PCL injury, then the affected tibia is posteriorly displaced when the knee is flexed (as when performing an anterior drawer test). If the examiner is not aware of the posterior sag and performs an anterior drawer test, the affected knee will feel as though it has significantly more anterior movement compared to the unaffected knee (because the affected knee started from a posteriorly displaced position) and may be mistaken for a positive anterior drawer test.

Such a fracture can injure the brachial artery directly or indirectly (local trauma can induce brachial artery vasospasm even if the brachial artery is not directly affected) and compromise arterial blood flow distal to the brachial artery. The brachial artery bifurcates into the radial artery and ulnar artery within the cubital fossa. A weak or absent radial pulse with a humerus fracture indicates disruption of the supplying brachial artery.\n\nDisplaced supracondylar fractures may also injure the radial nerve and median nerve, which lie close to the distal humerus. Ulnar nerve injury is rare with supracondylar fractures and typically occurs with medial epicondylar fractures.",

Other nerves that can be injured in skull base fractures involving the superior orbital fissure are the oculomotor nerve (ptosis with a fixed and dilated pupil), trochlear nerve (ocular extorsion and vertical diplopia), and ophthalmic nerve (absent corneal reflex). CN VI palsy is the most common cranial nerve palsy because of the long and tortuous route that CN VI takes intracranially, along which the nerve is vulnerable to injury by trauma (as in this patient), neoplasms (e.g., sphenoid ridge meningiomas), increased ICP (e.g., pseudotumor cerebri, SAH), neurovascular pathologies (e.g., cavernous sinus thrombosis, carotid-cavernous fistulas), and infection (e.g., syphilis).",

The facial nerve (CN VII) is commonly injured in fractures of the petrous part of the temporal bone (e.g., transverse temporal bone fractures) that extend from the internal acoustic meatus to the stylomastoid foramen.

            "description": "Symptoms in central facial palsy are caused by a contralateral upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion. Because muscles responsible for eyelid and forehead movements are innervated by upper motor neuron fibers from both hemispheres, their function is preserved in central facial palsy. In peripheral facial palsy, damage to lower motor neuron (LMN) fibers results in ipsilateral paralysis of all facial muscles. Because sensory and autonomic fibers join the lower motor neuron fibers of the facial nerve in its peripheral course, peripheral facial palsies can also manifest with non-motoric symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "The pudendal nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the perineum, external genitalia, and external urethral and anal sphincter muscles. A reflex erection occurs on tactile stimulation of the genital area, which stimulates the afferent fibers of the pudendal nerve. This activates a reflex arc with the parasympathetic nervous system at the sacral roots originating at S2 to S4, forwarding the stimulus to the inferior hypogastric plexus. This, in turn, leads to relaxation of the cavernous smooth muscle, which causes vasodilation (mediated by nitric oxide) and erection. The pudendal nerve may be injured in pelvic fractures or pelvic surgeries.",

The femoral nerve can also be damaged by pelvic trauma. However, it would manifest with further motor deficits, including impaired knee extension and a decreased patellar tendon reflex (paralysis of quadriceps femoris muscle). Additionally, sensory deficits of the anteromedial thigh (anterior cutaneous branches), medial lower leg, and medial edge of the foot (saphenous nerve lesion) would be expected instead of perineal hypesthesia, an absent sphincter reflex, and urinary incontinence.",

These fibers can be damaged by spinal cord injury but are unlikely to be impaired by pelvic trauma or surgery.

However, damage to the ilioinguinal nerve results in sensory loss in the root of the penis and the anterior scrotum, and damage to the genitofemoral nerve results in decreased sensation to the anteromedial thigh, neither of which is seen here.

It can therefore grow on the surface of foreign material such as prosthetic joints, prosthetic cardiac valves, IV catheters, and pacemakers. The patient underwent an arthroplasty in his left knee 4 months ago and is now presenting with septic arthritis, which makes a foreign body infection very likely. S. epidermidis is the most common cause of prosthetic infections 3–12 months after surgery.\n\nIf the patient's infection had developed either < 3 months or > 12 months after surgery, Staphylococcus aureus would be the most likely causal organism.",

The lateral corticospinal tract decussates at the level of the medulla. An injury distal to the decussation (e.g., at the level of T1) would, therefore, affect ipsilateral motor function below the level of the injury. In a full Brown-Sequard syndrome (e.g., hemisection of the spinal cord), there would also be ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception below T1 (dorsal column), ipsilateral Babinski sign (lateral corticospinal tract), and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation beginning two levels below the lesion (lateral spinothalamic tract).",

Respiratory failure develops because of pulmonary arteriolar obstruction by fat globules and/or endothelial injury induced by free fatty acids. Neurological symptoms occur because of either a paradoxical embolism or fat microemboli entering the systemic circulation. Fatty occlusion of dermal capillaries increases intracapillary pressure and causes the RBCs to extravasate, resulting in a petechial rash.",

The membranous portion of the posterior urethra is most susceptible to injury from high-risk pelvic fractures. Therefore, this patient's history of trauma and x-ray findings (fractures of all four pubic rami) are consistent with a torn posterior urethra. This patient should undergo a retrograde cystourethrogram to confirm urethral injury. Generally, placement of a Foley catheter should be avoided prior to performing urethrogram, as it may worsen the injury.",

He recently started basic infantry training and has been running several kilometers daily. Initially, the pain only occurred while running, but now it is also present at rest. The pain is located diffusely over the right forefoot. Vital signs are within normal range. Examination shows mild swelling over the distal right forefoot. Pressing the metatarsal of the third right toe results in pain. He walks with an antalgic gait. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the right foot shows a slight loss of cortical density and callus formation at the third metatarsal shaft. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Rest and acetaminophen are the treatment of choice of a metatarsal stress fracture. Stress fractures, the incidence of which is highest among athletes and military recruits, typically occur when there is a sudden increase in frequency, duration, or intensity of exercise. With physical activity, the bone normally undergoes a remodeling process to counteract the mechanical stress placed on the bone. However, without adequate rest, the remodeling process is disrupted, which can lead to microfractures of the bone that may eventually coalesce to form a stress fracture. Stress fractures are usually a clinical diagnosis, but imaging can be performed when a definitive diagnosis is required. Conventional x-ray, although specific, is not very sensitive, and findings often appear normal during the first 2–3 weeks. MRI, which is both highly sensitive and specific, is the best imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nNSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are typically avoided in the treatment of stress fractures due to the risk of nonunion.",

She reports pain in her left shoulder, left flank, and left hip. She has no history of serious illness but had a sore throat, fatigue, and fever for the past week. She does not take any medications. Her pulse is 105/min and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abrasions on the left upper arm, but no signs of fracture or dislocation. Passive and active range of motion of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist are intact. There is abdominal tenderness and guarding in the left upper quadrant. Her hemoglobin concentration is 9.8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5600/mm^3, and platelet count is 145,000/mm^3. An abdominal ultrasound shows free intra-abdominal fluid in the Douglas pouch. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's sonographic findings?",

However, while penetrating abdominal trauma (e.g., gunshot, knife wound) leads to immediate bowel injury and intestinal leakage, blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., this patient's fall) typically results in an intestinal contusion, which slowly develops into necrosis and intestinal rupture after several days. This patient's acute presentation after a fall makes another diagnosis more likely.",

        "explanation_why": "Left upper quadrant pain radiating to the left shoulder (Kehr sign), abdominal guarding, and hemorrhagic shock (tachycardia, decreased hemoglobin) after blunt abdominal trauma in a patient with a recent history of infectious mononucleosis (IM) is consistent with splenic rupture. IM is associated with splenomegaly, so affected individuals have an increased risk of splenic rupture and are therefore advised to avoid physical activity for at least 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. This patient's fall from a horse likely caused splenic rupture, resulting in hemoperitoneum and blood collection in the pouch of Douglas, as seen on this patient's abdominal ultrasound.",

However, kidney injury is not typically associated with pain that radiates to the left shoulder. Moreover, because the kidney is a retroperitoneal organ, free-fluid collection in the rectovaginal pouch of Douglas would not be expected in the absence of penetrating trauma, because the posterior border of the pouch is the peritoneum.

His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 76/62 mm Hg. No source of bleeding is seen besides small lacerations on his extremities. There is a significant ecchymosis in the right lower thoracic region and the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Chest auscultation shows no abnormalities. Peripheral venous access is established, blood samples for crossmatching and blood gas analysis are drawn, and rapid infusion of Ringer lactate (RL) solution is initiated. The patient is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. A FAST scan of the abdomen discloses blood in the hepatorenal recess. After the administration of 1000 mL of RL solution, the patient's blood pressure is 80/64 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

If available, fully crossmatched pRBCs are preferable for this purpose. Early resuscitation with blood reestablishes hemoglobin levels and, therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the intravascular volume. The reestablished capacity prevents organ ischemia and associated metabolic acidosis, both of which can complicate shock. If hemorrhage is extensive and the patient continues to be hemodynamically unstable, plasma and platelets should be transfused in addition to pRBCs at a 1:1:1 ratio. Transfusion of these blood products counters the risk of developing coagulopathy, which is another complication of shock associated with acidosis, hypothermia, trauma itself, fibrinolysis, and dilution due to fluid transfusion. In addition to transfusion of pRBCs, management of this patient should include immediate transfer to the operating room for laparotomy.",

Complications of Colles fracture include median nerve injury, compartment syndrome, and malunion or nonunion. Closed reduction may be considered as conservative therapy, but more severe fractures (e.g., unstable, intraarticular, or open fractures) require surgical therapy.\n\nSee “Overview of radius and ulna fractures.” table.",

The dotted white line illustrates the dorsal angulation of the distal fragment.) This type of fracture has been termed a Colles fracture. The pronator quadratus fat pad is displaced and seen as a convex lucency (red curved line). A fracture of the ulnar styloid is also present (white arrow).",

She was cleaning a table when she slipped forward and fell onto a flexed hand. Medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis. Current medications include perindopril, pitavastatin, and alendronate. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years. Examination shows warmth, tenderness, and edema of the left wrist. Range of motion is decreased due to pain. An x-ray series of the left arm shows multiple fragmentations at the distal radioulnar joint and an intraarticular oblique fracture with volar displacement of the distal fragment of the radius. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The mother reports that he vomited dark-green secretions 2 hours ago. One day before, he fell off his bicycle and the handlebar struck his abdomen. He has no personal or family history of serious illness. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a mildly distended abdomen that is tender to palpation. There are multiple ecchymoses on the upper abdomen. Bowel sounds are present. His hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, serum ALT activity is 38 U/L, and serum amylase activity is 102 U/L. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a large gastric bubble with no free intraperitoneal air. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Contrast extravasation indicates active hemorrhage.This is the typical radiological appearance of a splenic laceration with a splenic hematoma.",

In a child with a history of recent blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., handlebar injury during a fall from a bicycle), duodenal hematoma is the most likely diagnosis. Duodenal hematoma is a common injury in children following blunt abdominal trauma because the abdominal wall is thinner and less developed, making hollow viscus more prone to injury. The hematoma typically resolves spontaneously in days to weeks. Hemodynamically stable patients can be managed conservatively with nasogastric intubation and total parenteral nutrition. Laparotomy may be indicated in hemodynamically unstable children and/or in those with suspected duodenal perforation.",

The pain developed acutely during a lifting exercise, after which he was unable to lift his arm. He could not sleep last night because of the pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows mild swelling over the right shoulder. The right deltoid and distal clavicular region are tender to palpation. Active abduction and external rotation of the right shoulder are severely limited by pain. Passive external rotation is painful. An x-ray of the right shoulder is shown. An MRI of the right shoulder shows complete discontinuity of the supraspinatus tendon and mild effusion in the subacromial space. The shoulder is immobilized with a sling and analgesic therapy is initiated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

CO poisoning may manifest with nonspecific symptoms, such as confusion, and cannot be ruled out by standard pulse oximetry. Although testing with CO-oximetry and early administration of 100% oxygen is recommended for patients with suspected CO poisoning, another step in management is more urgently needed here.",

Although stress ulcer prophylaxis should be considered in any critically ill patient with a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration of the gastric mucosa usually begins several hours after the initial insult (e.g., trauma, burn injury). Moreover, this patient has no clinical features suggesting a stress ulcer, such as hypotension or shock, hematemesis, and melena.

        "explanation_why": "Disseminated bacterial infection is a possible complication of burn injuries, as burn wounds are often colonized by multiple pathogens (e.g., MRSA, Pseudomonas). In addition, prolonged exposure to smoke (e.g., due to entrapment in closed spaces) causes ciliary dysfunction, which decreases the clearance of airway secretions and increases the risk of bacterial pneumonia. This patient's burns involve > 30% of the body surface, which can lead to immunosuppression, increasing her risk of developing an infection. However, a bacterial infection is unlikely to occur in the first several hours after the incident. Though topical antibiotics should be applied to all nonsuperficial burns to prevent wound infection, another step in management is more urgently needed.",

        "explanation_why": "Volume overload from over-resuscitation with fluids can lead to serious complications (e.g., pleural effusions, compartment syndrome). The ATLS and American Burn Association now recommend only giving half of the 24-hour fluid resuscitation volume that is calculated by the Parkland formula, i.e., 2 mL x BW x %BSA instead of 4 mL x BW x %BSA (BW is body weight in kg; %BSA is the percentage of body surface area involved in 2^nd- and 3^rd-degree burns). Although fluids should be administered prudently, the patient likely has a volume deficit, not an overload, at this point. To avoid complications of under-resuscitation (e.g., acute kidney injury), fluid replacement with crystalloids should be initiated.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This patient's full-thickness burns over the face and singed nasal hair and eyebrows after being trapped in a burning apartment likely indicate thermal inhalation injury. Burn-related injury of the airways (often in combination with fluid resuscitation) can lead to the rapid development of upper airway edema and obstruction. Therefore, immediate intubation is necessary if inhalation injury is suspected or if burns involve more than 30–40% of the body surface, as seen here. Although this patient currently has no signs of impending respiratory decompensation (e.g., severe hypoxia, tachypnea) and only a mildly altered level of consciousness (GCS of 12), intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next steps to prevent sudden airway obstruction and respiratory failure.",

This condition is caused by air trapping in the pleural space, which, if severe enough, can compress the adjacent structures (e.g., contralateral lung, mediastinum) and impair venous return to the heart. This can cause life-threatening cardiopulmonary collapse, which manifests with severe hypotension and tachycardia. Emergency needle thoracostomy, followed by chest tube placement, is the first-line treatment for patients with suspected tension pneumothorax.\n\nEmergency chest tube thoracostomy is indicated in unstable patients, who present with bilateral tension pneumothorax or require mechanical ventilation.",

            "description": "A tension pneumothorax develops secondary to one-way valve mechanism, which is caused by an injury to the lung parenchyma or chest wall and allows air to enter the pleural space during inspiration (valve open) but not escape during expiration (valve closed). Progressive accumulation of air within the pleural space causes an ipsilateral increase in intrapleural pressure, leading to ipsilateral lung collapse and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side. The mediastinal shift compresses the vena cavae, trachea, and the contralateral lung, leading to hemodynamic instability and hypoxia.",

She hit her knee on a rock and then had to crawl on the ground for several meters until help arrived. She does not recall her immunization status. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 116/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left knee; range of motion is limited by pain. There is a 5 x 3 cm laceration just below the left kneecap; the skin is partly attached on the tibial side. The wound is covered with dirt and soil; there is erythema around the wound margins. The wound is thoroughly irrigated and debrided. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Both passive immunization (tetanus immunoglobulin) and active immunization (tetanus vaccine) are indicated for patients with dirty wounds and incomplete or unclear tetanus immunization status, as seen here. Passive immunization is necessary to rapidly neutralize C. tetani exotoxins. Active immunization with Td or Tdap prevents tetanus, and the vaccine should be administered every 10 years in all individuals. In addition to immunization, the wound should be cleaned thoroughly and any devitalized tissue that is present should be removed. The minor, contaminated laceration in this patient should be treated with secondary or tertiary wound closure; primary wound closure is contraindicated. For wounds with a high risk of infection, e.g., those with contaminated wounds in relatively poorly vascularized areas (like the knee), similar to what is seen here, oral antibiotic therapy for the prevention of wound infection is also recommended.\n\nSee “Tetanus prophylaxis after injury” table.",

        "explanation_why": "Oral antibiotic therapy for the prevention of wound infection is recommended for contaminated wounds in relatively poorly vascularized areas (e.g., around the knee), and this patient, who has an unclear vaccination status, does require the tetanus vaccine. However, a different time-sensitive step is more important and should be performed immediately.\n\nSystemic antibiotic therapy is indicated for a wound infection. This patient's laceration is contaminated but the swelling and wound margin erythema are the early inflammatory changes that occur following injury, and not the result of wound infection. Wound infection is unlikely to occur within 3 hours.",

During this time, she has also had intermittent pain in her right arm for which treatment with ibuprofen has provided some relief. She is a professional tennis player but has not been able to practice because her symptoms get worse when she swings the racquet overhead. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her only medication is a vitamin supplement. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 110/73 mm Hg. Physical examination of the right hand shows decreased sensation to light touch in the 4^th and 5^th fingers. Repeated opening and closing of the hands with the arms raised above the shoulder causes pain and a sensation of heaviness in the right arm. Percussion over the right medial epicondyle of the humerus does not reproduce the symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Initially, the pain was only present when he took his first steps in the morning or after running for a while, but now it is constant. He is unable to put any weight on his right foot. He recently traveled and spent a lot of time walking to various tourist attractions over the course of 6 weeks. He has no other history of serious illness and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows mild swelling of the right heel. There is tenderness to palpation on the medial and lateral aspects of the posterior right heel; compressing the sides of the heel between the fingers elicits pain. The plantar surface of the heel is only mildly tender to palpation. Sensation is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

These fractures commonly manifest with heel swelling and heel pain upon activity. While these symptoms may also be seen in other conditions (e.g., plantar fasciitis, heel pad syndrome, Achilles tendinopathy), tenderness to palpation and positive calcaneal squeeze test (pain upon compression of the posterior sides of the heel) are specific for calcaneal stress fractures. Diagnosis can be confirmed with MRI. Note that conventional x-rays might not show any signs of fracture immediately; a subtle sclerotic band may be visible after two to three weeks. Treatment options depend on the patient's symptoms and may include activity restrictions and acetaminophen for pain relief.",

She is in the military reserve and was involved in active combat 2 weeks ago, during which she sustained multiple gunshot wounds to her left lower leg resulting in irreversible limb ischemia. She is currently taking oral acetaminophen, which has provided minimal pain relief. The patient has a history of bronchial asthma for which she uses an albuterol inhaler. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 123/75 mm Hg. Physical examination of the residual limb shows mild erythema and drainage of a scant amount of serous fluid from the sutured wound. Muscle strength in the hip and upper leg is normal bilaterally. Sensation to pain and temperature is normal in the left upper leg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Because there is insufficient research on treatment for phantom limb pain, a multimodal approach is typically recommended. Other forms of first-line treatment for phantom limb pain include mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and pharmacotherapy with NMDA receptor antagonists.

He was brought to the emergency department 4 hours ago after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, he was oriented to person, place, and time. During the procedure, he received 6 units of packed red blood cells, 1 unit of platelets, and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma. On admission to the postoperative ward, his vitals were within normal limits. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Now, his temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 78%. Bibasilar crackles are heard on auscultation. Chest x-ray shows diffuse, bilateral infiltrates. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's deterioration?",

        "explanation_why": "Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a transfusion reaction caused by the activation of the recipient's granulocytes by soluble factors (e.g., antibodies) in the donor's blood. Activated granulocytes release proinflammatory mediators that increase the vascular permeability, resulting in plasma transudation into the pulmonary interstitium and consequent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. TRALI typically occurs during or within 6 hours of transfusion. Patients usually present with hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, features of pulmonary edema (e.g., crackles, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray), and signs of hypovolemia (hypotension, tachycardia). Signs of hypovolemia distinguish TRALI from transfusion-associated circulatory overload, which, in contrast to TRALI, characteristically manifests with findings of volume overload (e.g., elevated blood pressure, S3 gallop, jugular venous distension). Immediate cessation of any ongoing transfusion followed by supportive treatment with respiratory and circulatory support is recommended.",

He had a similar episode 3 hours ago, which resolved spontaneously after 10 minutes. Both episodes began shortly after he was repositioned in his bed. One week ago, he was brought to the emergency department in an unresponsive state after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hematoma and the patient was transferred to the operating room for an emergency craniotomy with hematoma evacuation. Since his arrival to the intensive care unit after the procedure, he has remained intubated and mechanically ventilated, and his vital signs have been stable. His medical history is unavailable. He appears diaphoretic. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 155/min, and blood pressure is 160/94 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. The pupils are equal and reactive bilaterally. The cranial surgical site is dry. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is a complication of TBI that is thought to be caused by the loss of inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system due to cortical injury. It usually manifests about one week after the inciting event with recurrent episodes of hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, diaphoresis, muscle spasms, and possibly dystonia with posturing. PSH episodes can occur spontaneously or be triggered by external stimulants, such as patient repositioning or extraction of the endotracheal tube. Episodes typically last up to 30 minutes and are self-limiting.\n\nPSH is a clinical diagnosis. Other diagnostic tests (e.g., EEG, head CT/MRI) can be considered to rule out other diagnoses. Management is conservative and varies according to the constellation of symptoms. Opioids (e.g., morphine, fentanyl), sympatholytics (e.g., clonidine, propranolol), benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam), and myorelaxants (e.g., dantrolene, baclofen) are commonly used to reduce symptoms of PSH.",

The pain started suddenly during a run that was part of an exercise program for weight loss, which he started 4 weeks ago. Since the onset of pain, he has mainly stayed at home to rest his leg. He has hypertension and chronic bacterial prostatitis. He drinks one to two beers daily and does not smoke cigarettes. His medications are hydrochlorothiazide and levofloxacin. One week ago, he returned from a business trip to Australia. He is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination of the right leg shows swelling and tenderness to palpation of the posterior distal calf and the posterior heel. There is no plantar flexion when squeezing the calf while the patient is in the prone position. Compression of the medial and lateral aspects of the heel does not elicit pain. Examination of the left leg shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, physical examination usually shows localized tenderness with compression of the soft tissue behind the Achilles tendon superior to the calcaneus, not tenderness of the posterior distal calf and the posterior heel.

        "explanation_why": "Achilles tendon rupture commonly manifests with acute, severe pain during strenuous activity, calf tenderness, calf swelling, and abnormal Thompson test. A loud snapping sound is a hallmark of this condition, although it does not occur in every patient. Risk factors for Achilles tendon rupture include male sex, advanced age, obesity, a sudden increase in exercise intensity, and the use of fluoroquinolones. Although rupture of the Achilles tendon is usually a clinical diagnosis, ultrasonography and MRI might be used to confirm the diagnosis. Conservative management of Achilles tendon rupture includes icing, analgesics (e.g., with NSAIDs), immobilization, and rest, while surgical options include an open or percutaneous tendon repair. The choice between conservative therapy and surgical therapy depends largely on comorbidities, age, and activity level.",

Salter-Harris fractures, which most often occur at the onset of puberty or during growth spurts, can lead to premature closure of the physis, placing individuals at risk for persistent limb-length discrepancy. Premature physeal closure is more likely to occur in Salter-Harris type III and IV fractures. Salter-Harris fractures can be managed with closed reduction and immobilization for nondisplaced fractures (typically types I and II) or open reduction and internal fixation for dislocated fractures (typically types III, IV, and V).",

He moans, “Thankfully, nothing hit my head.” The patient is in pain but alert. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There is bruising along the right hemithorax and an open fracture of the left distal forearm. The right leg appears shorter than the left leg and there is swelling of the right knee. Blood is leaking from the urethra. A Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) shows no free fluid in the thorax or abdomen. A portable x-ray of the pelvis is shown. The patient becomes increasingly somnolent. His pulse is now 105/min and blood pressure is 89/72 mm Hg. Two large-bore intravenous catheters are placed, intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun, and transfusion products are ordered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

This patient is hemodynamically unstable and has no signs of intraabdominal hemorrhage (no free fluid on FAST). In this setting, interventions for pelvic hemorrhage control (e.g., immediate pelvic stabilization using an external binder) and measures for hemodynamic support (e.g., fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions) are indicated. Hemodynamically unstable patients with signs of intraabdominal hemorrhage require expedited emergency laparotomy and interventions for pelvic hemorrhage control simultaneously. Hemodynamically stable patients require a CT scan with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis. If evidence of arterial bleeding is present in the CT, prompt angioembolization is indicated to avoid complications (e.g., abdominal compartment syndrome, hemorrhagic shock, death). After initial intervention, surgical exploration and stabilization are indicated.",

Because the fracture site is intracapsular, there is typically little bruising. This patient's x-ray confirms the diagnosis and shows a right-sided femoral neck fracture with complete displacement of the bone fragments. Immediate management of a femoral neck fracture is essential to prevent severe complications such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head and sciatic nerve injury. In patients < 60 years of age with nondisplaced fractures, open reduction with internal fixation is recommended; patients > 80 years with displaced fractures will require primary arthroplasty, typically total hip replacement.",

To determine whether an x-ray is indicated in ankle injuries, providers in the emergency room or doctor's office use the Ottawa ankle rules, which are highly sensitive for excluding fractures. The Ottawa ankle rules state that a plain radiograph of the ankle is indicated if there is tenderness at the posterior border or tip of either the medial or lateral malleolus, or if the patient is unable to bear weight, which is defined as the inability to take four steps or transfer weight to each foot twice. Regardless of whether a fracture is detected, RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) is integral to the initial management of ankle injuries.",

On arrival, he is alert and fully oriented and reports right flank pain. Medical history is remarkable for kidney stones and depression. His only medication is sertraline. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 91/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/75 mm Hg. He appears anxious. Physical examination shows multiple superficial abrasions of the extremities. Lungs are clear to auscultation. There is right flank tenderness and tenderness to deep palpation of the right abdomen without guarding or rebound. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and coagulation studies, are within normal limits. Urinalysis shows 15 RBCs/hpf. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows a 1.5-cm laceration of the right kidney with an adjacent, 1.5 x 2-cm hematoma. There is no evidence of urinary extravasation and no free intraperitoneal fluid. Administration of intravenous fluids and analgesics is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Serial imaging is generally not needed but should be considered if the patient develops signs of deterioration (e.g., worsening flank pain, abdominal distension). Hemodynamically stable patients with vascular or urinary collecting system injuries can also be managed conservatively but should be monitored in the ICU with serial laboratory studies and imaging, as these patients are at increased risk of complications (e.g., bleeding, urinoma). Patients with expanding hematomas but no other signs of active intraabdominal bleeding or injury can be treated with angioembolization.

    "question_text": "A 22-year-old man comes to the emergency department after he was bitten by a friend 2 hours ago. He reports that he was at a party where some other partygoers, including his friend, took “bath salts,” after which his friend became increasingly agitated and aggressive. While the patient was attempting to soothe him, the friend lunged at the patient and bit his shoulder. Medical history is remarkable for anxiety disorder and the patient's only medication is citalopram. He does not smoke. He drinks 3–4 beers on weekends and occasionally uses cannabis. Immunizations are up-to-date; his last tetanus booster was 3 years ago. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 6-cm wide oval bite mark on the lateral left shoulder with a 4-cm laceration on the lower edge of the bite mark with mild oozing of blood. No particles or foreign bodies are visible. There are no motor or sensory deficits distal to the wound; capillary refill is less than 2 seconds.

He reports that he was at a party where some other partygoers, including his friend, took “bath salts,” after which his friend became increasingly agitated and aggressive. While the patient was attempting to soothe him, the friend lunged at the patient and bit his shoulder. Medical history is remarkable for anxiety disorder and the patient's only medication is citalopram. He does not smoke. He drinks 3–4 beers on weekends and occasionally uses cannabis. Immunizations are up-to-date; his last tetanus booster was 3 years ago. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 6-cm wide oval bite mark on the lateral left shoulder with a 4-cm laceration on the lower edge of the bite mark with mild oozing of blood. No particles or foreign bodies are visible. There are no motor or sensory deficits distal to the wound; capillary refill is less than 2 seconds. The wound is irrigated and devascularized wound edges are debrided. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

With the exception of the face, all bite wounds should be kept clean with a sterile dressing and allowed to heal without suturing. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate, 2^nd or 3^rd generation cephalosporin) should be administered to all patients with human bites. Tetanus prophylaxis should be given to patients who are not up-to-date on their vaccinations.",

        "explanation_why": "Tibiofemoral dislocations are potentially limb-threatening injuries, as they are often associated with neurovascular injury. Reduction should not be delayed for further diagnostics, especially if vascular compromise is suspected (e.g., diminished distal pulses). Vascular compromise can result from compression by displaced surrounding structures and may be reversible with reduction. Immediate closed reduction should be performed to treat anterior tibiofemoral dislocations. Following reduction, pulses are reevaluated and ankle-brachial index is measured to screen for vascular injury. If vascular injury is suspected, further imaging with either doppler ultrasonography or CT angiography may be performed. X-rays of the knee can confirm reduction.\n\nFor cases of posterolateral tibiofemoral dislocation, in which the medial collateral ligament and medial capsule invaginate into the joint, open reduction is indicated.",

Although posterolateral dislocations result from high-energy trauma and manifest with pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight, this patient's tibia is palpated anterior to the femoral condyles, which suggests an anterior rather than posterior tibiofemoral dislocation. An indentation of the skin at the medial femoral condyle can also be seen in patients with posterolateral dislocations as a result of the invagination of soft tissue into the intercondylar notch.",

An ABI > 0.9 is considered normal, and an ABI < 0.9 should prompt further vascular evaluation. However, as signs of vascular compromise can result from compression by surrounding displaced structures, they might be reversible prior to starting management.

On arrival, he is alert and oriented to person and place, but not time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a knife in situ that enters the thoracic wall just above the 7^th rib in the left midaxillary line. The right lung is clear to auscultation; auscultation of the left lung and cardiac examination remain inconclusive as the patient does not tolerate being examined near the entrance wound. Abdominal examination shows mild diffuse abdominal pain without guarding or rebound. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Five minutes later, the patient becomes unresponsive. Repeat vital signs are temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 120/min, respirations 28/min, and blood pressure 88/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In cases of hemodynamic instability where there is a strong clinical suspicion of cardiac tamponade (e.g., muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins) or tension pneumothorax (e.g., absent breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion on the ipsilateral side), emergency pericardiocentesis or tube thoracostomy, respectively, should not be delayed by imaging.",

However, pain due to Raynaud phenomenon is episodic and transient and is associated with triggers (e.g., cold air). Moreover, limb edema is not a feature of this condition. Finally, Raynaud phenomenon most commonly affects the fingers and toes. This patient's symptoms are more consistent with CRPS, which requires a different type of management.",

For up to 2–3 months after surgery, patients are at risk for DVT, which can manifest with unilateral leg pain and swelling. However, DVT typically manifests with a dull aching pain rather than burning pain and causes warmth in the affected limb rather than decreased temperature. This condition does not cause allodynia.

Pathomechanisms thought to be involved include abnormal local inflammatory response, dysfunctional pain perception, and sympathetic overactivity. Physical and occupational therapy is the recommended first-line therapy for CRPS. Therapy focuses on ensuring daily function and motion of the affected limb, decreasing pain, and improving the patient's quality of life. Commonly used strategies include desensitization and relaxation techniques, gait retraining, functional activities, and edema control strategies. Patients with CRPS may also require medical therapy for pain management (e.g., oral corticosteroids).",

OD is caused by overuse or repetitive microtrauma of the joint (most commonly the knee joint), typically affects individuals aged 10–20 years, and manifests with joint pain that worsens with activity, joint locking, crepitus, and tenderness to palpation. The diagnosis is confirmed with x-ray, which shows a subchondral bony fragment surrounded by radiolucency. Conservative management with limited physical activity and physical therapy is the first-line treatment for OD. Surgical therapy is indicated for most adult patients and for children with detached and displaced intraarticular fragments or who do not respond to conservative management.",

        "explanation_why": "MRI is the first-line imaging test to identify and assess the extent of meniscal tears, showing a hyperintense line in the meniscus with possible distorted meniscal morphology. Treatment depends on the extent of the injury and the patient's age. Conservative therapy with rest, ice, and elevation of the affected limb, along with analgesia and physical therapy (to strengthen the quadriceps muscle) is usually appropriate for simple tears in patients with preexisting degenerative changes in the knee joint. Indications for arthroscopic repair include complex meniscus tears and severe persistent functional impairment.",

Most meniscal tears heal poorly and will worsen with weight-bearing and physical activity. The absence of an intact meniscus would also predispose this patient to early osteoarthritis. Small (< 5 mm), stable, asymptomatic meniscal tears in the peripheral red zone (vascularized region), as well as degenerative meniscal tears in elderly individuals, can be treated nonoperatively with initial restriction of knee movement, followed by physical rehabilitation and follow-up.",

        "explanation_why": "Although the most likely diagnosis in this patient is meniscal injury, other conditions that manifest similarly (e.g., an intraarticular loose body due to osteochondritis dissecans) should be ruled out before surgery. The exact site and extent of meniscal injury, as well as the presence of other associated injuries (e.g., ligamentous injury), need to be determined before considering meniscal repair. Moreover, open knee surgery to visualize and/or repair the meniscus is inappropriate when less invasive diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are available. Open meniscal repair may be performed when meniscal injury is associated with fractures of the articular surfaces of the distal femur or proximal tibia, or in the case of severe knee dislocation. However, such are not commonly seen following sports traumas but typically only occur as a result of high-energy trauma (e.g., road traffic accidents, fall from a height).",

Both these conditions usually manifest with joint erythema and warmth, along with severe joint tenderness on palpation and severe restriction of knee joint movement. This patient presents with lateral joint line tenderness and a mild restriction in knee extension without any joint erythema or warmth, making the diagnoses of joint infection or gout unlikely. In the case of meniscal injury, arthrocentesis may be performed if severe hemarthrosis occurs. In such a setting, arthrocentesis would provide quick symptomatic relief until surgery could be performed. However, this patient does not have a joint effusion on physical examination that would be typical of severe hemarthrosis.",

The pain started when he rotated his upper body to throw his opponent on the ground during a wrestling competition at school. He has no history of hip or knee injuries. His past medical history is significant for asthma, for which he takes daily inhaled corticosteroids. He does not smoke cigarettes but reports occasionally drinking beer and smoking marijuana with some of his friends after school. He is at the 65^th percentile for height, 90^th percentile for weight, and 69^th percentile for BMI. On physical examination, the left leg is slightly flexed at the hip and externally rotated. Range of motion of the left hip is decreased. There is tenderness over the groin and medial aspect of the upper thigh that worsens with hip flexion and rotation. An x-ray of the hip is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

A sudden, forceful contraction of the iliopsoas muscle pulls the lesser trochanter away from the femoral shaft, resulting in lesser trochanter apophysis avulsion. This can cause significant groin and medial thigh pain and swelling, and reduced range of motion in the affected hip that worsens with hip flexion and rotation. The fracture is typically self-limiting and managed with conservative measures (e.g., rest, ice, physical therapy). Surgical repair is required for fractures with displacement of > 1 cm.",

On arrival, he is responsive only to painful stimuli. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 132/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 78/49 mm Hg. Physical examination shows cool, clammy skin and absent radial pulses. Lung examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is initiated, but the patient's blood pressure remains low. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma shows a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen. The decision is made to intubate the patient for airway protection. Shortly after endotracheal intubation and initiation of positive pressure ventilation, the patient's blood pressure drops to 62/38 mm Hg, and his pulse rises to 148/min. Airway pressures are consistent, and lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical deterioration after intubation?",

        "explanation_why": "This patient with severe hypotension, tachycardia, cool clammy skin, and absent radial pulses is in hypovolemic shock, likely due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage resulting from the motor vehicle collision. Hypovolemia causes low preload, so the heart relies on high venous return to maintain cardiac output. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) increases intrathoracic pressure, which further impedes venous return to the right heart. In a patient who is already volume-depleted, this can cause a precipitous drop in cardiac output and blood pressure, manifesting with acute worsening of hypotension and tachycardia after intubation.\n\nAdequate volume resuscitation before and during intubation, using the lowest possible mean airway pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure, and close hemodynamic monitoring are essential when performing intubation and PPV in patients with shock.",
