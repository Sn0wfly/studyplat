Gardnerella vaginalis is the most common cause of this condition.",

        "explanation_why": "Pseudohyphae are loosely filamentous forms of fungi assumed by many yeasts, particularly Candida albicans, during growth. They are commonly seen on wet mounts of patients with vaginal yeast infections (vulvovaginal candidiasis), which are associated with odorless, white, crumbly, and sticky vaginal discharge that may resemble cottage cheese. Pregnancy, antibiotic use, and immunosuppression are predisposing factors for vaginal thrush. Even though this patient had a course of amoxicillin, her discharge is foul-smelling and yellow-green, making a candidal infection very unlikely. Also, vaginal pH is typically normal (4–4.5) in vulvovaginal candidiasis.",

It also affects adults, particularly those who are immunocompromised (e.g., due to HIV infection, chemotherapy, or extensive corticosteroid therapy). MC is transmitted through direct skin contact, autoinoculation, or fomites. Lesions are typically nontender and located on the face, trunk, and extremities. Sexually transmitted MC can cause lesions in the groin, lower abdomen, and genitals. In contrast to this patient's skin lesions, characteristic MC lesions are pearly, flesh-colored, dome-shaped, and smooth with a central umbilication.",

If this patient had rectal bleeding or other concerning symptoms, benign causes (e.g., hemorrhoids, anal fissure, and warts) would be investigated first.",

These lesions are cauliflower-like in their appearance, with a flat, papular, or pedunculated shape, and are commonly found on the mucosa or along the epithelium of the anogenital tract. They are usually asymptomatic but may be painful or pruritic in some cases. Application of 3–5% acetic acid will turn the lesion white, though this test has poor specificity for warts since polyps or leukoplakia can also appear white. Risk factors for HPV include multiple sexual partners and unprotected sexual intercourse.",

She has not sustained any trauma or injury to the area, nor has she traveled or taken part in outdoor activities in the recent past. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 106/72 mm Hg. Physical examination shows multiple painless pustular lesions on her ankles and the dorsum and soles of her feet bilaterally, as well as a swollen, erythematous, exquisitely tender left knee. Her wrists are also mildly edematous and tender, with pain on extension. An x-ray of the knees shows tissue swelling. Arthrocentesis of the knee shows yellow purulent fluid. Gram stain is negative. Analysis of the synovial fluid shows a leukocyte count of 58,000/mm^3 with 93% neutrophils and no crystals. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

Additionally, if gonorrhea were present, treatment would also be indicated for sexual partners from the last 60 days because of potentially severe complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, urethritis, and/or infertility.

Although sexual intercourse is the primary risk factor for bacterial vaginosis, this condition is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of the vaginal flora resulting in overgrowth of Gardnerella bacteria (and a relative lack of the normally dominant lactobacilli). Another risk factor for this imbalance is vaginal douching, which this woman reports she does regularly. Bacterial vaginosis is commonly asymptomatic, but when symptomatic, individuals should receive treatment with either oral or topical metronidazole. As bacterial vaginosis is not an STI, partner treatment is not routinely recommended. The CDC recommends that women who are being treated for bacterial vaginosis refrain from sexual activity or use condoms consistently and correctly, as well as avoid douching, as it increases the risk of relapse.",

Management focuses on antibiotic treatment with azithromycin, which is continued until the ulcers have completely healed.\n\nEven though this patient's sexual behavior puts him at increased risk and his presentation is highly characteristic of granuloma inguinale, mixed infections and bacterial superinfection are common; therefore, he should be screened for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and HIV.",

In addition, it is often accompanied by painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, suggesting a different causal organism here.",

Painful suppurative lymphadenopathy (buboes) is seen 2–6 weeks after the papule heals and is accompanied by systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise, chills). This patient has multiple large, vascular ulcers, no regional lymphadenopathy, and no systemic signs, making LV unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "The risk for vertical transmission to the neonate from an infected mother is high (up to 50%) among women who exhibit active genital herpes near the time of delivery. Cesarean delivery is indicated in women with recurrent and active genital herpes at the onset of labor to reduce the risk of transmission and thereby prevent neonatal HSV, which could result in severe complications like disseminated disease or meningoencephalitis. Although oral acyclovir does not prevent vertical transmission, it will help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. In severe infection, IV acyclovir should be considered. If HSV lesions are not genital, delivery can proceed as normal. After birth, breastfeeding can also continue as usual unless lesions are on the breast.\n\nOral acyclovir can be used as suppressive therapy for genital herpes after 36 weeks' gestation until delivery in women with a prior history of genital herpes.",

Two months ago, he had a painless lesion on his penis that resolved a few weeks later without treatment. He has asthma. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler. He is currently sexually active with 3 different partners. He uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. He has a diffuse maculopapular rash involving the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. An HIV test is negative. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) are positive. The patient receives a dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. Two hours later, he reports headache, myalgias, and chills. His temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 98/67 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

After administration of antibiotic treatment (usually in the early phases of the secondary stage of syphilis), the release of bacterial endotoxins and pyrogens can elicit a systemic reaction consisting of flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, headache, myalgia), tachypnea, hypotension, and tachycardia. JHR is a common complication of treatment of spirochetal infections (e.g., borreliosis, leptospirosis, syphilis) and is usually self-limiting within 12–24 hours.",

While these may occur following medical treatment (e.g., with antibiotics) and may manifest with skin lesions, they are typically urticarial and not maculopapular. Since fever and myalgias are not caused by anaphylaxis and further typical symptoms (e.g., erythema, angioedema, dyspnea) are absent in this patient, the diagnosis is unlikely and treatment with epinephrine is not necessary.",

The diagnosis of syphilis is confirmed using a serial testing strategy. In the standard testing algorithm, an NTT (e.g., VDRL, plasma reagin test) is performed first. If the result is positive or equivocal, a TT is performed. In the reverse testing algorithm, a TT is performed first, followed by an NTT test. A positive result for both tests strongly supports the diagnosis of syphilis. FTA-ABS tests become positive 2–3 weeks after infection and have a very high positive predictive value. Because treponemal tests usually remain positive regardless of treatment or disease activity, a positive FTA-ABS indicates either active syphilis infection or persistent antibodies from a prior infection.",

He has also had a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. He has not had urethral discharge. He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

If the Gram stain shows no organisms (especially no diplococci, which would be expected in gonorrhea), C. trachomatis should be suspected, as its cell wall does not stain. C. trachomatis can be diagnosed by nucleic acid amplification. Treatment of C. trachomatis epididymitis consists of ceftriaxone and doxycycline (see “Differential diagnosis of scrotal pain” table).",

    "hint": "This patient's high risk sexual behavior, dysuria, and pyuria (positive leukocyte esterase) are consistent with epididymitis but his young age, the sudden onset of scrotal pain, and the presence of vomiting and testicular swelling also increase the likelihood of a condition that can result in permanent morbidity if not detected and treated within 6 hours of symptom onset.",

Since epididymitis in young, sexually active male individuals is most frequently caused by sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a combination of ceftriaxone and doxycycline is the most appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment for this patient. Moreover, his presentation makes a different step in management necessary.",

Although this patient's presentation increases the likelihood of testicular torsion, the diagnosis of testicular torsion is not yet conclusive at this time because of an intact cremasteric reflex, the absence of a hard and high-riding testis, and the presence of features of epididymitis. A different step in management should be performed first.",

        "explanation_why": "While epididymitis is the most likely cause of this patient's acute testicular pain, the most dangerous differential diagnosis is testicular torsion. In patients with acute testicular pain, an absent cremasteric reflex is relatively specific for testicular torsion but the presence of a cremasteric reflex does not rule out the condition. For this patient, a scrotal ultrasound is necessary to definitively rule out testicular torsion. If testicular torsion is not corrected early by surgery, testicular ischemia will result in necrosis and loss of the testicle. Scrotal ultrasound is also performed as a part of the management of epididymitis in order to rule out a scrotal abscess, a common complication that may require surgical drainage.",
        "explanation_but": "Risk stratification scores (e.g., TWIST score) can be used to formally assess the risk of testicular torsion. For your exam, it is not necessary to know how to calculate the TWIST score but to follow this principle: always consider testicular torsion in a patient with acute testicular pain and if testicular torsion cannot be ruled out clinically with a high level of certainty, perform a scrotal ultrasound.",

However, in mumps orchitis, a sudden onset of fever is expected. Furthermore, the classic course of mumps infection includes a prodromal phase with low-grade fever, respiratory symptoms, malaise, and headache, followed by parotitis, which is not consistent with this patient's clinical presentation.",

He first noticed the lesion 1 year ago but was too embarrassed to mention it at his last annual physical examination. The lesion has since grown in size and has recently become erythematous. At age 45, he was successfully treated for phimosis with a steroid cream. He first engaged in sexual intercourse at age 14 and has had “too many sexual partners to count” in his lifetime. He has hypertension treated with lisinopril. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. He drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. Physical examination shows a nontender, ulcerated, 5 × 5 mm lesion with an erythematous base on the dorsum of the glans. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Excisional biopsy of the lesion is performed. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on this patient's biopsy specimen?",

This patient's lesion has been growing for a year now, which should raise suspicion of cancer. Additionally, he has three independent risk factors for SCC of the penis, including phimosis, smoking, and a sexual history that predisposes him to HPV infection. Considering the chronic nature of the lesion and this patient's personal history, his biopsy will most likely show histopathological findings of SCC.",

In the earliest stage of syphilis (primary syphilis), patients present with a painless papule that evolves into an ulcer with a smooth base and indurated border (chancre) at the site of inoculation, as seen here. Painless, nonsuppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy occurs within a week of the chancre's appearance. If left untreated, the disease progresses after a period of 8–12 weeks to secondary syphilis with generalized nontender lymphadenopathy, polymorphic rash, fever, condylomata lata, and/or patchy alopecia. Finally, tertiary syphilis can cause cardiovascular manifestations (e.g., ascending aortic aneurysm) and neurosyphilis.\n\nThe presence of characteristic clinical features and positive serology raises suspicion for syphilis. Dark-field microscopy or PCR showing Treponema pallidum in exudate from the chancre confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, the patient should be offered HIV testing and screening for other sexually transmitted infections, as his syphilis infection is indicative of high-risk sexual behavior. Treatment of primary syphilis consists of a single intramuscular injection of penicillin G.",

HPV vaccines are recommended by the CDC to all persons aged 9–26 years and are most effective before exposure to HPV via sexual activity; they are routinely administered at 11–12 years of age. The tetravalent and 9-valent vaccines provide ∼ 99% coverage against the types of HPV most commonly implicated in genital warts (types 6 and 11) and in cervical cancer (especially types 16 and 18) for at least 10 years after vaccination (likely longer, but data is only available for that time period). Given this patient's sexual history, HPV vaccine would most likely have prevented this condition.\n\nSome older HPV vaccines (e.g., Cervarix®) do not cover the types of HPV associated with genital warts (types 6 and 11) and only protect against cervical cancer.",

Her immunizations are up-to-date. She is sexually active with her boyfriend of 2 months and uses an oral contraceptive; they use condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 94/min, and blood pressure is 120/76 mm Hg. Examination shows tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. There are 4 tender, purulent 1.5-cm ulcers with a necrotic base along the labia majora. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

In addition, chancroid is often accompanied by painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. Treatment of chancroid is with single-dose oral azithromycin or intramuscular ceftriaxone.",

He has not taken any medications for over 5 years. He sleeps in homeless shelters and parks. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several bright red, friable nodules on his face, trunk, and extremities. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/mm^3. A rapid plasma reagin test is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows hepatomegaly and a single intrahepatic 1.0 x 1.2-cm hypodense lesion. Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and abundant neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",

In the standard testing algorithm, an NTT (e.g., VDRL, plasma reagin test) is performed first. If the result is positive or equivocal, a TT is performed. In the reverse testing algorithm, a TT is performed first, followed by an NTT test. A positive result for both tests strongly supports the diagnosis of syphilis. Because treponemal tests usually remain positive regardless of treatment or disease activity, a positive FTA-ABS indicates either active syphilis infection or persistent antibodies from a prior infection.",

Nontreponemal tests are nonspecific and often used as a first screen. Treponemal tests are then used if the nontreponemal tests yield positive or equivocal results.

Other manifestations of HPV infection include vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, as well as skin warts (verruca vulgaris) and plantar warts.\n\nAs this patient's Pap smear is consistent with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the next step in management includes testing for high-risk HPV strains (i.e., 16, 18, 31, and 33) via PCR.

The absence of vaginal pain or erythema further supports this diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis typically develops when the pH of the vagina rises above 4.5, which allows G. vaginalis to multiply and results in the characteristic malodorous vaginal discharge. Predisposing factors include a shift in vaginal flora (e.g., douching decreases Lactobacillus that maintain vaginal pH between 3.8 and 4.5), the release of amines from increased bacterial degradation of proteins, and/or increased sexual activity (as the pH of semen is between 7.2 and 7.8).",

Apart from the immunosuppression enabling the persistence of HPV infection, HIV also seems to directly promote HPV-associated carcinogenesis.\n\nHigh-risk types of HPV (i.e., 16, 18, 31, 33) are also associated with cervical cancer (almost all cases), as well as anal, oral, and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.",

Eggs are transmitted through the fecal-oral route, typically via contaminated hands or during sexual intercourse, which is why close contacts of infected patients are often also affected. However, this patient's photomicrograph shows a nit attached to a shaft of a pubic hair, which is not typical for E. vermicularis. Enterobiasis is instead diagnosed through direct visualization of mobile worms in the perianal region or with a positive tape test, in which eggs of the worm are visible.",

He recently had unprotected sex with his girlfriend, who is the same age as him. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test for Chlamydia trachomatis is positive. The patient says that his girlfriend knows about his symptoms, but he does not want his parents to be notified of his sexual activity or his positive test for a sexually transmitted infection because they do not approve of premarital sex. He adds that he wants to avoid any further conflicts with his mother, as they have been fighting recently. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

Serum antibody testing is another diagnostic test for HSV infection, but it cannot be used for primary infections because specific antibodies only develop following seroconversion.

Furthermore, in a patient with irritable bowel syndrome, constipation is a common feature and a risk factor for developing hemorrhoids. However, internal hemorrhoids more commonly appear as dilated, purple or blue veins on anoscopy rather than an exophytic ulcerated mass, and, because they arise from the superior hemorrhoidal plexus, they are located above the dentate line rather than the anocutaneous line. Moreover, defecation is usually painless and weight loss is not expected.",

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histological type of anal canal cancer and typically arises below the dentate line (see “Characteristics of the anal canal above and below the dentate line” table). Patients must undergo a biopsy of the tumor to confirm the diagnosis. Women diagnosed with anal canal squamous cell carcinoma should also undergo a gynecological examination for cervical cancer screening.",

He has no history of similar symptoms. He is sexually active with one male partner, who is the same age, and uses condoms inconsistently. He is in his junior year at a local high school and lives with his parents and his older sister. Vital signs are within normal limits. Genitourinary examination shows yellow-green urethral discharge. The testes are symmetrical without tenderness or masses. A diagnosis of gonococcal infection is made. The patient requests treatment. The physician informs the patient that antibiotic therapy will be necessary. He encourages the patient to talk to his parents, but the patient says that he does not wish to inform them about the infection. When the physician asks the patient about his reasons for not wanting to do so, the patient says “They don't even know about my boyfriend and would be extremely angry if they found out. Would you be able to prescribe me antibiotics without informing my parents?” Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

This patient does not want his parents to know that he is sexually active or has an STI. Accordingly, the physician is ethically and legally obliged to keep his medical information confidential from his parents (although minors should, in general, be counseled to have open discussions about health with their parents or legal guardians). However, since Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is a reportable disease, the physician is required to report the case to a public health official. Ideally, all of the patient's sexual partners within the past 60 days should be informed (either by the patient or by the public health official, but not by the physician!), evaluated for gonococcal infection, and treated if positive. Alternatively, the physician could provide expedited partner therapy (EPT), especially if the likelihood of follow-up is low.\n\nIntramuscular injection of ceftriaxone is used both for targeted and empirical therapy for gonococcal infection. If chlamydial coinfection is present or has not been ruled out, oral doxycycline is added. If EPT is required, a single dose of oral cefixime can be administered instead of ceftriaxone. If chlamydial infection is present or has not been excluded in the patient's partner, doxycycline (preferred) or azithromycin should be added.",

Asymptomatic bacteriuria does not usually result in symptomatic infection, so the USPSTF recommends against this screening in nonpregnant adults. Screening may result in overtreatment, increasing the risk of patients developing adverse effects from antibiotic therapy and raising the risk of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",

Although this patient has a first-degree relative with ovarian cancer, which thereby increases her risk of developing ovarian cancer, serum CA-125 concentration measurement is not recommended for screening of ovarian cancer in asymptomatic patients. Patients with a high-risk family history should rather be referred to genetic counseling.",

In young women, HPV infections tend to be transient and resolve without treatment, and testing in this age group results in a considerable false-positive rate, which can lead to unnecessary invasive procedures (e.g., cervical biopsy, loop excision, conization). In women younger than 21 years old, such as this patient, the USPSTF recommends against cervical cancer screening as the harms outweigh the benefits.",

N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections are often asymptomatic in women but can result in complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Screening consists of nucleic acid amplification tests of the urine, which have both high sensitivity and specificity for these infections. Although there is not a defined screening interval, it is reasonable to annually repeat the screening in women with new or persistent risk factors.",

In women younger than 21 years old, such as this patient, cervical cancer is rare and screening might result in false-positive results, which may lead to unnecessary invasive procedures (e.g., cervical biopsy, loop excision, conization). Some of these procedures increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm delivery). Because evidence shows that the harms of cervical cancer screening in women younger than 21 years of age outweigh the benefits, the USPSTF recommends against screening in this age group.",

Although chancroid ulcers can have an erythematous base, they are usually covered in gray-yellow exudates. In addition, chancroid ulcers are typically extremely painful, whereas this patient has reported only mild pain. Moreover, chancroid is extremely rare in the United States.",

These vesicles rupture easily, leaving punched out, erythematous ulcerations, as seen here. Primary infection with HSV is usually more severe and lasts longer than recurrent infection, and it often manifests with extragenital findings, including tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, dysuria, fever, and malaise. Although genital herpes is typically self-limited, antiviral drugs (e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir) diminish the severity and duration of episodes and reduce viral shedding. Recurrence, which is caused by the reactivation of dormant virus in ganglion neurons, is common.",

Evaluation with anoscopy should also be considered to evaluate for involvement within the anal canal.\n\nRecurrence and refractory disease are common in patients with anogenital warts, especially in individuals with immunosuppression. Treatments for anogenital warts include cytodestructive therapies (e.g., trichloroacetic acid), immune-mediated therapies (e.g., imiquimod), and surgical therapies (e.g., cryoablation, excision).",

Diphtheria manifests acutely with sore throat, malaise, fever, pseudomembranous pharyngitis, and painful lymphadenopathy. Oral HPV infection manifests with warts or oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (SCC). Oropharyngeal SCC can result in a nontender ulcerative lesion and painless cervical lymphadenopathy, but there is no evidence of a malignancy on this patient's lymph node biopsy. There is currently no immunization available against this patient's infection.",

His nontender oral ulcer with raised, indurated borders (chancre) and concomitant nontender lymphadenopathy (due to reactive follicular hyperplasia) is consistent with primary syphilis. The chancre is usually solitary, and develops at the site of inoculation after about 3 weeks. The chancre resolves without scarring after 3–6 weeks regardless of treatment. While primary syphilitic lesions most often occur in the genital region, about 5–10% of cases of primary syphilis are extragenital. Typical localizations are the oral cavity, hands and fingers, or the anus and perianal region, which reflect sexual practices, but chancres can occur wherever the skin has been in contact with Treponema pallidum from infectious sores. The use of a condom during vaginal or anal sex, and a dental dam during oral sex, can protect an individual against STIs by preventing contact with body fluids or an infectious lesion.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test is a treponemal test (TT) that detects antibodies against treponemal antigens. Serological syphilis testing algorithms combine TTs and nontreponemal tests (NTTs) to reduce the rate of false-positive results and confirm the diagnosis. The standard algorithm consists of an NTT followed by a TT, whereas the reverse algorithm involves a TT followed by an NTT. If both tests are positive, a current or past T. pallidum infection is likely. False-negative results are possible in early primary syphilis as antibodies do not develop until 1–4 weeks after the ulcer appears. TTs can seroconvert earlier than NTTs, which makes TPPA more likely to yield a positive result in a patient with early syphilis.\n\nDirect detection methods (e.g., dark-field microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody test, PCR) are highly specific diagnostic alternatives. However, these techniques require specialized laboratory equipment, which is often unavailable. T. pallidum cannot be cultivated in vitro or visualized with light microscopy.",

Additionally, granuloma inguinale lesions are most commonly located on the foreskin, coronal sulcus, or glans. This patient has a single ulcer with no bleeding that is located on the anus, which is more consistent with syphilis, and Treponema pallidum cannot be visualized with light microscopy.",

His only medications are metformin and amlodipine. He is sexually active in a monogamous relationship with his wife and does not use condoms. He reports that his wife does not have similar symptoms. He works as a long-haul truck driver. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 123/72 mm Hg. Genital examination shows purulent discharge from the urethral meatus. There is no scrotal swelling or tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Nucleic acid amplification testing of urethral discharge is positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. The results of a screening test for HIV and a rapid plasma reagin test are negative. The physician counsels the patient on the need to return for a follow-up visit and bring his wife into the office for testing. The patient says that it is difficult for them to take time off from work, and they can only come for a visit in several weeks. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

To prevent reinfections, the CDC recommends that all sexual partners from the past 60 days be evaluated and treated with the same regimen as the patient. If sexual partners cannot be evaluated in a timely manner, EPT with a single dose of oral cefixime is recommended. Oral doxycycline should be added to the treatment if chlamydia infection has not been excluded in the index patient. In addition to EPT, sexual partners should be provided with written information on gonorrhea, its treatment, and adverse effects of medication. They should also be advised to seek medical evaluation if symptoms or adverse events occur.\n\nEPT is legally allowed in most states, although under varying conditions.
