    "question_text": "A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room because of a 2-hour history of swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father had a pulmonary embolism at the age of 30 years. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 3 years. He appears distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm^3, prothrombin time of 11 seconds, partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This young man presents with deep vein thrombosis (swollen, tender leg with positive Homan sign, positive D-dimer, positive ultrasonography signs). Despite receiving a therapeutic dose of heparin, his partial thromboplastin time (PTT) hardly increases and remains within normal limits, suggesting a defect in the protein targeted by heparin.",

        "explanation_why": "Protein C deficiency is an autosomal dominant hypercoagulable disease caused by overactivity of factors V and VIII, which are normally inhibited by protein C. Heparin, on the other hand, acts on thrombin and factor Xa, not on factors V and VIII, so its anticoagulant action is unaffected by protein C deficiency.",

This condition would not prevent an increase of PTT because antibodies play no role in heparin's mechanism of action, so it is not a likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "Elevated levels of homocysteine can be seen in patients with mutations in enzymes that metabolize homocysteine (autosomal recessive), vitamin B12 deficiency, and vitamin B6 deficiency. Hyperhomocysteinemia is considered a risk factor for thrombosis as it alters the function of thrombomodulin, factor VII, and factor V. Excess homocysteine also damages the vasculature leading to decreased endothelial antithrombotic activity. However, this patient has no evidence of anemia due to vitamin B6 or B12 deficiency (fatigue, pallor, tachycardia) or a family history of metabolic disease (enzyme deficiency). Moreover, homocysteine plays no role in heparin's mechanism of action and, therefore, does not affect the efficacy of heparin.",

Overactivity of factor V results in excessive activation of prothrombin, leading to a hypercoagulable state. Because neither protein C nor factor V interacts with heparin, its efficacy is unaffected in patients with Factor V Leiden.",

        "explanation_why": "Antithrombin III deficiency (AT III deficiency) is an inherited autosomal dominant hypercoagulable disease. AT III inhibits coagulation by binding to and inactivating the coagulation factors II (thrombin) and X. Heparin works by potentiating the binding of AT III to thrombin and factor X. This patient's PTT remains normal despite heparin administration because heparin requires AT III to achieve its effect. Patients with AT III deficiency can tolerate higher doses of heparin (also known as heparin resistance) without showing any changes in PTT. If therapeutic goals are not achieved with heparin (1.5 to 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range of PTT), additional antithrombin concentrate may be needed.\n\nSee “Pathophysiology of hereditary thrombophilia” table.",

            "description": "Clotting homeostasis is maintained through a balance of procoagulation (purple) and anticoagulation (gray) processes. The procoagulation pathway ultimately results in the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, which is an integral part of blood clot formation. The procoagulation pathway is physiologically inhibited through two distinct anticoagulation pathways, using either antithrombin III or the APC complex.Antithrombin III inactivates factors IX, X, and thrombin. This process is accelerated in the presence of heparin. Additionally, antithrombin III indirectly increases the activation of plasmin through the action of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), resulting in the degradation of both fibrinogen and fibrin.The APC complex pathway involves the activity of thrombomodulin, a membrane protein expressed on endothelial cells that activates protein C. Activated protein C then binds to protein S to form the APC complex, which inactivates procoagulation factors V and VIII. The procoagulation factor thrombin can also activate protein C, which results in a negative feedback loop on the procoagulation pathway.",

He had 80% stenosis in the left carotid artery and received heparin prior to the surgery. He has a history of two transient ischemic attacks, which occurred two and four months ago, respectively. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. He drinks 1–2 beers on weekends. Current medications include lisinopril, metformin, sitagliptin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 111/min, and blood pressure is 180/110 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows pupils that react sluggishly to light. There is a right facial droop. Muscle strength is decreased in the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ on the right. There is a left cervical surgical incision that shows no erythema or discharge. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, electrolytes, and glucose are within the reference range. A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?",

Chronic hypertension results in lipohyalinosis of the arterial walls, leading to microaneurysm formation and elevated risk of rupture. Acute hypertension then leads to rupture of the weakened vessels, which likely was the mechanism of rupture in this patient.\n\nManagement of intracerebral hemorrhage depends on the intracranial pressure (ICP) of the patient. If ICP is normal, blood pressure should be decreased to < 160 mm Hg through labetalol or nicardipine administration. If intracranial hypertension is suspected (as is likely in this patient, given his altered mental status and sluggishly reactive pupils), blood pressure should be lowered more cautiously, as cerebral perfusion must be maintained. Finally, if herniation is suspected (e.g., uncal herniation), emergency craniotomy is required.",

        "explanation_why": "While a tension pneumothorax can manifest with tachycardia and hypoxia, the lung is typically hyperresonant and not dull to percussion. Additionally, although mediastinal shift is seen on the chest x-ray of tension pneumothorax, absent lung markings would also be expected and there would not be a widened mediastinum.",

            "description": "X-ray chest (PA view)A large pneumothorax (green overlay) has resulted in collapse of the right lung along the mediastinum (edge marked by white dashed line). No bronchovascular markings are seen in the right hemithorax. Additionally, the mediastinum has shifted to the contralateral left side (blue line and arrows), the right hemidiaphragm is depressed (red line and arrow), and the right intercostal spaces are widened (example indicated by white arrows).These findings are characteristic of tension pneumothorax.",

During the past 14 years, she has had multiple ulcers over the same ankle that have subsided with wound care and dressing, which she gets from a local pharmacy. The patient has not been evaluated by a physician in 15 years. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, and omeprazole. She is 162 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 89 kg (196 lb); BMI is 34 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 7.5-cm (3-in) ulcer with elevated, indurated margins and a necrotic base above the left medial malleolus. The skin around the left ankle appears darker than the right and there are multiple excoriation marks. There is 2+ pretibial edema of the lower extremities. Peripheral pulses are 3+ in all extremities. Sensation to pinprick, temperature, and vibration is normal over the lower extremities. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

However, arterial ulcers are typically found on pressure points of the foot such as the lateral malleolus. Moreover, despite having risk factors for PAD (e.g., diabetes, obesity), this patient does not have other characteristic findings, such as absent or diminished peripheral pulses, intermittent claudication, or rest pain. Finally, DSA is an invasive and expensive procedure, and ankle-brachial index is the first-line diagnostic test for PAD.",

The progression of a chronic wound to a Marjolin ulcer is slow, with a latency period of several years to decades until malignant transformation occurs. Marjolin ulcers have a poor prognosis and require prompt diagnosis (using a punch biopsy or a wedge biopsy in patients with larger lesions) to determine further management. In addition to histologic confirmation, patients require grading and staging of the tumor.\n\nSurgical excision of the lesion along with a margin of normal skin is the primary method of treatment; radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may be used as adjuvants.",

However, pulse pressure is an indicator of stroke volume and not a direct indicator of end-organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation aims to achieve adequate end-organ perfusion, so a change in pulse pressure is not the best indicator to evaluate fluid resuscitation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion and to restore intravascular volume. Since renal blood flow (and therefore GFR) is highly sensitive to changes in blood pressure and intravascular volume, urine output can serve as a surrogate measure to determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate. Ideally, urine output in adults should be greater than 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Therefore, a 70-kg man should have a urine output of 35–70 mL/hr. A urine output of 25mL in 3 hours suggests that his kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow and therefore that he has not received adequate fluid resuscitation.\n\nWith adequate fluid resuscitation, an increase in some of the other indices, such as pulse pressure and Glasgow coma scale, might occur before a change in urine output is apparent. However, these parameters are not specific indicators of end-organ perfusion. Other parameters, such as lactate and a base deficit, are more useful for determining the prognosis than for guiding fluid therapy.",

However, serum lactate levels are not used to determine whether fluid resuscitation is inadequate because, even after adequate fluid resuscitation and correction of tissue hypoperfusion, lactate levels may not reach normal levels (< 2 mEq/L) for a few hours. Lactate clearance may take even longer in critically ill patients as a result of a prolonged lactate half-life (due to hepatic and/or renal dysfunction) and/or increased glycolysis.

    "question_text": "A 63-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of severe abdominal pain that started suddenly 1 hour ago while he was having a barbecue with his family. The pain is located in the middle of his abdomen, and he describes it as 10 out of 10 in intensity. He feels nauseated and has vomited twice. He has also had a loose bowel movement. He was diagnosed with hypertension 2 years ago and was started on hydrochlorothiazide. He stopped taking his pills 1 week ago because of several episodes of heart racing and dizziness that he attributes to his medication. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years. He is in severe distress. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm. Bowel sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft and mildly tender. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin\n16.8 g/dL\n\nLeukocyte count\n13,000/mm^3\n\nPlatelet count\n340,000/mm^3\n\nProthrombin time\n13 seconds\n\nPartial thromboplastin time\n38 seconds\n\nLactate (venous)\n\n2.4 mEq/L (N = 0.5–2.2)\n\nSerum\n\nUrea nitrogen\n15 mg/dL\n\nCreatinine\n1.2 mg/dL\n\nLactate dehydrogenase\n215 U/L\n\nCT angiography is performed, and the diagnosis is confirmed. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "This patient has severe abdominal pain disproportionate to his unremarkable abdominal examination. This finding, along with leukocytosis, increased serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, irregularly irregular rhythm suggesting atrial fibrillation, and acute progression of symptoms, are most consistent with acute mesenteric ischemia due to embolic occlusion of the mesenteric arteries.",

Because this patient has stable vital signs and a benign abdominal exam, explorative laparotomy is not the preferred treatment at this time.",

However, anticoagulation with warfarin requires bridging therapy with heparin because of the initial risk of warfarin-associated hypercoagulation. In addition, warfarin therapy is a long-term measure to treat underlying AF but is not indicated in the management of acute mesenteric ischemia.",

Poor patient preparation will likely lead to poor visualization of the colon, and the diseased bowel is more prone to perforation when insufflating while advancing the scope.",

        "explanation_why": "MR angiography can be used to identify blocks in the mesenteric vessels. CT angiography is usually preferred over MR angiography because it is faster and more sensitive for nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia and for distal thromboembolism of the mesenteric arteries. MR angiography may be used in patients with acute mesenteric ischemia who are allergic to contrast agents used with CT imaging. Because this patient has already received CT angiography to confirm the diagnosis, he does not need further imaging.",

This procedure is minimally invasive, and studies suggest similar efficacy to open surgical treatment. Reassuring vital signs and benign abdominal examination findings in this patient suggest acute bowel ischemia without permanent infarction, which is likely to resolve with the restoration of blood flow. This patient should also receive supportive measures (e.g., intravenous fluids, nasogastric decompression, broad-spectrum antibiotics) as well as anticoagulation, preferably with unfractionated heparin.",

She used to be able to walk a half-mile (800 m) to the grocery store but has been unable to walk 200 meters without stopping because of the pain over the past month. The pain subsides after 5 minutes, after which she can walk again. She has hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 32 years. Current medications include metformin, enalapril, aspirin, and warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an irregularly irregular pulse. The right lower extremity is cooler than the left lower extremity. The skin over the right leg appears shiny and dry. Femoral pulses are palpated bilaterally; pedal pulses are diminished on the right side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Duplex ultrasonography is appropriate in suspected acute limb ischemia (ALI), which may manifest with coolness and decreased pulses in the leg, and is likely in a patient with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking) and a history of heart disease (i.e., atrial fibrillation). However, the onset of ALI is typically acute, involving severe, acute pain, paresthesia, and weakness of the leg. This patient likely has PAD, in which duplex ultrasonography can be helpful to assess blood flow status; however, a different, quicker, and less expensive test should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the first-line diagnostic test in PAD because it is readily available, noninvasive, as well as highly specific and sensitive. Reduced ABI values between 0.4–0.9 indicate mild to moderate PAD with claudication, whereas values below 0.4 correlate to severe PAD with resting pain and/or gangrene. An ABI > 1.4 in patients with suspected PAD may indicate calcific sclerosis with noncompressible vascular walls (e.g., in patients with diabetes). A low ABI (≤ 0.9) and a high ABI (> 1.4) are associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In patients with a normal ABI and high suspicion for PAD, exercise testing may be required. Vascular imaging (e.g., with MR angiography) is not required for diagnosis but helps assess site(s) and extent of arterial occlusion or stenosis and collateral blood flow if revascularization is planned.",

    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "This patient will undergo surgery with a moderate risk of perioperative bleeding in 5 days, and his mechanical mitral heart valve, age, and hypertension increase his risk of thromboembolism. To balance these risks, the Vitamin K antagonist warfarin should be discontinued (VKA interruption), and preoperative bridging anticoagulation should be initiated.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Preoperative bridging anticoagulation involves the temporary administration of a short-acting parenteral anticoagulant after VKA interruption. Because warfarin has a half-life of approximately 36–42 hours, starting the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin 2 days after discontinuation (or after 2–3 missed doses) allows warfarin to reach subtherapeutic levels. This timing ensures that the patient is not at a higher than necessary risk of hemorrhage from two anticoagulants. Alternatively, INR can be monitored and bridging anticoagulation started as soon as INR is in the subtherapeutic range. Because LMWHs have a short half-life (e.g., 3–5 hours for dalteparin), discontinuing LMWH 24 hours before surgery minimizes the risk of excessive bleeding during and immediately after the procedure. After surgery, VKAs can usually be resumed after 12–24 hours.\n\nPreoperative bridging anticoagulation is recommended for patients at high risk of developing perioperative thromboemboli. Risk factors include history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the past 3 months, presence of a mechanical mitral heart valve with major risk factors for stroke (e.g., hypertension, age ≥ 75 years), atrial fibrillation with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 7, history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the past 3 months, rheumatic valvular heart disease, and active cancer with increased VTE risk (e.g., gastric or pancreatic cancer). In most patients, preoperative bridging anticoagulation is not recommended due to the risk of perioperative bleeding.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Starting the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran immediately after discontinuing warfarin would not allow adequate time for warfarin to be eliminated from the body, since the half-life of warfarin is approximately 36–42 hours. The patient would be at a high risk of bleeding with two anticoagulants at the same time. Moreover, dabigatran is contraindicated in patients with a mechanical valve because it has been shown to increase the risk of thromboembolic events in this patient population. Finally, dabigatran has a half-life of 15 hours, making it less optimal than drugs with shorter half-lives because it is not reliably eliminated from the body immediately before surgery.",

However, patients with cardiac tamponade typically have muffled heart sounds, hemodynamic instability, and distended (rather than flat) neck veins. The normal FAST scan and the absence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray make a hemopericardium unlikely.",

Contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CECT angiography) is indicated for the diagnosis of aortic injury in hemodynamically stable patients and should be performed if the patient has symptoms suggestive of aortic injury (e.g., chest pain), a history of high-energy trauma, or features that suggest aortic injury on the FAST scan (e.g., hemothorax) or chest x-ray (e.g., mediastinal widening, aortic knob loss). CECT angiography has high sensitivity and specificity, can screen for additional vascular injuries (e.g., abdominal aortic injury), and provides anatomical information for planning surgical management. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be urgently evaluated with transesophageal echocardiography in the operating room.",

Massive PE can cause major obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in increased right heart pressures and features of right heart failure, like jugular venous distension. Obstruction of the pulmonary vessels leads to a decreased right heart output, resulting in normal or mildly decreased PCWP and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which leads to decreased cardiac output and, consequently, obstructive shock. SVR increases to compensate for the decrease in cardiac output.",

Her medications include metformin and an oral contraceptive pill.  She is 162 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. Examination shows hirsutism. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. An abdominal bruit is heard on the left side. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Plasma free metanephrines are within the reference range. An abdominal ultrasound shows an increased peak systolic velocity in the distal portion of the left renal artery. A CT angiography of the abdomen shows alternating stenosis and dilation in an 8-mm distal segment of the left renal artery with approximately 75% reduction in the diameter of the vessel; the left kidney is significantly smaller than the right kidney. A CT scan of the brain shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "All patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic renal artery stenosis (RAS), including those with underlying fibromuscular dysplasia, should be initiated on medical therapy with an ACE inhibitor (e.g., ramipril) or an angiotensin receptor blocker to control hypertension. In patients with hemodynamically significant RAS complicated by heart failure, hypertensive emergencies, resistance to medical treatment, or an unexplained unilateral small kidney (as seen here), revascularization is indicated in addition to medical therapy. The short duration of hypertension in this patient is a further indication that interventional revascularization is likely to normalize blood pressures. In patients with fibromuscular dysplasia who have severe unilateral disease, as in this case, PTA without stent placement is the first-line revascularization procedure. In the absence of complications (e.g., arterial dissection, renal artery perforation), stent placement is usually avoided.\n\nIn patients with bilateral stenosis or stenosis of a single functioning kidney, revascularization is indicated if there is progressive renal insufficiency or hemodynamically significant RAS. Serum creatinine and potassium levels should be closely monitored after initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with RAS, especially those with bilateral stenosis, because of the risk of acute kidney injury resulting from inhibition of angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole.",

Renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen (produced by the liver) to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; produced by the lungs). Angiotensin II acts to increase blood pressure by causing vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and ADH production.The specific targets of the different RAAS inhibitors are highlighted in red.",

The most common cause in older adults is atherosclerotic emboli, which is consistent with this patient's age, extensive atherosclerotic risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, stable angina pectoris, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus), history of possible transient ischemic attack, and finding of an ipsilateral carotid bruit on examination.",

Cardiogenic emboli are the most common cause of retinal artery occlusion in younger patients (< 40 years of age) and should be suspected based on a patient history that includes, e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF), endocarditis, or valvular disease. However, while this patient does have a history and exam findings that both suggest retinal vessel occlusion and a TIA, he has no AF and there are signs of carotid artery stenosis. Echocardiography would be an appropriate step in management only after atherosclerotic causes of this patient's symptoms have been ruled out.",

Suspicion of GCA should be especially high in patients above the age of 50 with fundoscopy findings of pallid optic disc swelling without apparent emboli. While our patient's monocular vision loss and history of intermittent monocular blurriness could be consistent with GCA, he lacks additional symptoms such as temporal headache or jaw claudication, and his fundus examination reveals clearly demarcated areas of vascular involvement, which is not consistent with GCA.

        "explanation_why": "Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a fast, noninvasive diagnostic method that may be used to evaluate the proximal ascending aorta for dissection. TTE does not, however, allow for visualization of the remainder of the aorta, i.e., mid and distal ascending aorta, transverse arch, and descending aorta. Therefore, TTE may not detect dissection in this patient who presents with interscapular pain, which suggests involvement of the proximal descending aorta. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of TTE are lower than that of the recommended imaging modality for aortic dissection.",

It has high sensitivity and specificity for aortic dissection, is widely available, and provides important anatomical information for surgical management. This patient has renal insufficiency and is therefore at increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.

The aortic arch and descending aorta are not affected. The right and left coronary, the innominate, the left common carotid, and the subclavian arteries originate from the true lumen (green overlay; false lumen is red overlay). Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta. Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen.Additional findings include sternotomy wires, a prosthetic aortic valve, atherosclerotic calcifications, pancreatic calcifications, and a small hiatal hernia.LCA: left coronary artery; RCA: right coronary artery; yellow overlay: azygos vein",

TEE is the preferred initial study in hemodynamically unstable patients (it can be rapidly performed at the bedside or in the operating room) and patients with renal insufficiency (because of the increased risk of developing contrast-induced nephropathy with CT angiography) or contrast allergy. This imaging modality helps visualize intimal dissection flaps, true and false lumens, thromboses in false lumen, aortic regurgitation, and pericardial effusion, and it aids in determining whether surgical intervention is warranted.

He has poorly controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 31 years. Current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, and ibuprofen. He appears to be in severe pain and is clutching his right leg. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 102/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 152/94 mm Hg. The right leg is cool to the touch, with decreased femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation in the right leg. An ECG shows absent P waves and a variable RR interval. Right leg Doppler study shows inaudible arterial signal and audible venous signal. Angiography shows 90% occlusion of the right common femoral artery. In addition to initiating intravenous heparin therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "The patient likely has atrial fibrillation (irregularly irregular pulse, absent P waves, variable RR interval) that has been complicated by intraatrial clot formation and embolization affecting the right common femoral artery. His symptoms indicate limb-threatening ischemia (Rutherford stage IIb), which requires urgent intervention.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient presents with limb-threatening ischemia (Rutherford stage IIb), indicated by his severe pain, decreased motor function and sensation, and inaudible arterial Doppler signal. In addition to intravenous heparin therapy (to prevent further clot formation and embolization), the patient requires revascularization within 6 hours to restore blood flow and increase the probability of limb salvage. Balloon thrombectomy and bypass surgery are appropriate revascularization procedures for patients with embolic acute limb ischemia and a threatened extremity.",

Although this patient has advanced ischemia, his limb would be classified as “threatened” rather than “nonviable” given the presence of a venous Doppler signal and some motor and sensory function. In a nonviable limb, arterial Doppler signals, venous Doppler signals, and motor and sensory function are entirely absent.",

During this period, he has had to reduce his hours as a construction worker because of pain in his lower back and thighs and a progressive lower limb weakness when walking for longer distances. His pain resolves after resting for a few minutes, but it recurs when he returns to work. He also reports that his pain is improved by standing still. His last visit to a physician was 25 years ago. He is sexually active with 4 female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. His father has coronary artery disease and his mother died of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm at the age of 53 years. He has recently taken sildenafil, given to him by a friend, with no improvement in his symptoms. His only other medication is ibuprofen as needed for back pain. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years.  He is 172.5 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 102 kg (225 lb); BMI is 34 kg/m^2.

Decreased bilateral femoral pulses indicate occlusion of either the bilateral iliac arteries or the aortic bifurcation. Lesions at either of these locations cause aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome), which manifests with the classic triad of buttock, hip, or thigh claudication; erectile dysfunction; and absent or diminished femoral pulses. Given this patient's high risk for cardiovascular disease and complaints in accordance with two-thirds of the classic triad, Leriche syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nAtrophy of the affected limbs is also common in Leriche syndrome.",

The surgery was without complication and following the procedure, peripheral pulses were weakly palpable. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Prior to admission, her medications included insulin, enalapril, carvedilol, aspirin, and rosuvastatin. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 132/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a left groin surgical incision and swelling, stiffness, and exquisite tenderness to palpation of the left lower extremity. Femoral pulses are palpated bilaterally. Pedal pulses are weaker on the left side. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin\n12.1 g/dL\n\nLeukocyte count\n11,300/mm^3\n\nPlatelet count\n189,000/mm^3\n\nSerum\n\n Glucose\n222 mg/dL\n\n Creatinine\n1.1 mg/dL\n\nResults of urinalysis are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?",

        "explanation_why": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity may manifest with asymmetric swelling and pain. However, an asymmetrical reduced pedal pulse and stiff extremity should raise concern for compartment syndrome. DVT may also be complicated by compartment syndrome but the rapid onset of this patient's symptoms and known ischemic injury (femoral arterial thrombus and thromboembolectomy) make another cause more likely. Ultrasound is a helpful diagnostic tool to distinguish DVT from compartment syndrome if physical examination findings are equivocal.",

        "explanation_why": "Cases of extremity reperfusion injury in which ischemic endothelium leads to increased capillary permeability and tissue swelling may be severe enough to induce compartment syndrome. This patient's ischemic injury likely resulted from the femoral artery clot in addition to cross-clamping during surgery. Reperfusion then caused oxidative stress and inflammation, worsening tissue damage and swelling (i.e., ischemia-reperfusion edema). Increased compartment pressure obstructs venous outflow and can collapse arterioles, further worsening tissue perfusion and ischemia.",

From a distal source such as the femoral artery, a cholesterol embolism may manifest with sudden-onset severe pain at the foot and leg and diminished pedal pulse. This patient has risk factors for cholesterol deposits (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus), but whole-extremity involvement, as well as swelling and stiffness of the leg, make embolism less likely. Moreover, a cholesterol embolism typically causes skin changes (livedo reticularis, purpura, necrosis) over the affected area.",

On arrival, he is unconscious. His pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large-bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) results are negative. An ECG shows absent P waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?",

    "hint": "While hypotension following acute trauma should raise concern for blood loss, this patient's negative FAST exam makes intraabdominal or intrathoracic bleeding less likely. Instead, his profound hypotension despite an apparently normal volume status, the bibasilar lung crackles, and elevated jugular venous pressure potentially indicate cardiogenic shock.",

        "explanation_why": "In the context of a serious motor vehicle collision, this patient's hypotension and tachycardia refractive to fluid resuscitation, including vasopressors, combined with atrial fibrillation on ECG and a negative FAST, are highly suspicious for cardiac contusion. Cardiac contusions may manifest with clinical features ranging from asymptomatic arrhythmias to rapidly fatal cardiac rupture. Blunt chest trauma and/or sudden deceleration can lead to decreased contractility and arrhythmias due to injury to cardiac myocytes and pacemaker cells. Decreased contractility directly contributes to cardiogenic shock with decreased cardiac output and hypotension, as in this patient.",

It may also be associated with a raised jugular venous pressure. In severe cases of hemothorax, blood loss into the thoracic cavity can lead to hemorrhagic shock, with subsequent tachycardia and hypotension. However, a hemothorax is distinctly identifiable on chest x-ray or on ultrasound as part of the FAST exam. No signs of internal bleeding are apparent on this patient's FAST exam and the physical exam findings (bibasilar crackles, soft abdomen) make a significant hemothorax even more unlikely.",

Aortic dissection is associated with hypotension either if the dissection involves the ascending aorta resulting in cardiac tamponade and/or aortic regurgitation, or if it results in aortic rupture and hemorrhage into the mediastinum. On the FAST exam, however, aortic rupture would be apparent as free fluid above the diaphragm, with secondary cardiac tamponade as fluid accumulates in the pericardium. Moreover, secondary aortic regurgitation severe enough to affect the patient's vitals would be heard on auscultation.",

Symptoms may then worsen following fluid administration as fluid accumulates in the damaged lung.

She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include lisinopril and metformin. She works as a waitress at a local diner. Her father died of liver cancer at the age of 61 years. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily and occasionally more on weekends. She does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows 1+ pitting edema in both lower extremities up to the level of the calves with relative sparing of the feet. There are several dilated, compressible tortuous veins measuring 4–5 mm over both lower extremities, and multiple excoriation marks are noted over both ankles. There is a 2 x 2-cm ulcer with a shallow base and irregular edges over the medial surface of the left ankle. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Serum glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, D-dimer concentrations, and results of liver function tests are within the reference ranges. The ankle-brachial index is 1.1 bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "Lower extremity edema with relative sparing of the feet and dilated tortuous veins > 3 mm in diameter (varicose veins) in the absence of other systemic findings (e.g., pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention) strongly suggests chronic venous disease (CVD), for which this patient's age, sex, and job that involves prolonged standing are risk factors.

These drugs are primarily used in the management of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which can cause lower limb ulcers but such ulcers typically have regular margins and a punched-out appearance and occur over pressure points (e.g., tips of toes, lateral malleolus). Furthermore, PAD causes pale, shiny, cold, hairless skin on the lower extremities rather than edema and dermatitis and the normal ankle-brachial index (1.0–1.4) makes PAD extremely unlikely.",

The goal is to identify whether the patient has a correctable cause of venous reflux (e.g., reflux in the superficial venous system), and to plan for an interventional procedure (e.g., by identifying the superficial, deep, and perforator vein sites) if the patient qualifies for such a procedure.\n\nAn initial trial of compression therapy is appropriate for patients with mild CVD (i.e., varicose veins or edema only) without a correctable cause, and pregnant patients with CVD. A patient with advanced CVD, as seen here, or a correctable cause of venous reflux should undergo endovenous thermal ablation as long as there are no contraindications to the procedure (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, peripheral artery disease). All patients with CVD should be counseled on lifestyle changes to improve venous return (e.g., daily exercise, frequent elevation of the legs, avoidance of long periods of standing and sitting).",

Although PAD can sometimes manifest as acute limb ischemia (ALI) from plaque thrombosis, it is unlikely to cause significant swelling, redness, or a positive Homan sign. Instead, ALI patients present with a cool limb, decreased peripheral pulses, and, in some cases, sensory symptoms. PAD usually has a chronic, progressive course and manifests with exertional leg cramping, which is not present in this patient.",

The problem is that warfarin first decreases anticoagulant proteins C and S because of their shorter half-life (6–10 hours), before reducing the coagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X (half-life of 2–4 days). As a result, warfarin monotherapy induces a transient hypercoagulable state for the first couple of days. Without bridging therapy, this state could worsen the patient's DVT and/or cause warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Regardless of this effect, however, anticoagulation is contraindicated in this patient because of his high risk of bleeding (recent surgery and intracranial hemorrhage).",

He was admitted to the hospital 1 month ago for myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization and angiography showed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and he underwent placement of 2 stents. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. There is no family history of serious illness. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, rosuvastatin, and enalapril. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Examination shows a 3-cm (1.2-in), tender, pulsatile mass in the left thigh, below the inguinal ligament. There is mild erythema of the overlying skin. A loud bruit is heard on auscultation of the mass. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There is no edema in the lower limbs. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, most cases usually occur during or immediately after the procedure, and the pain is usually more acute and severe, while this patient presents with mild groin pain for the past 2 weeks. Also, the presence of a pulsatile swelling makes a different diagnosis more likely.",

Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms manifest with pain in the groin, a pulsatile mass, and a systolic bruit over the swelling. Duplex ultrasonography is required to distinguish a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm from other conditions that may manifest similarly (e.g., femoral artery hematoma, femoral arteriovenous fistula, femoral artery aneurysm, saphenous varix). On ultrasound, a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is usually visible as a nonhomogenous hypoechoic mass that is connected to a femoral vessel via a patent track. Bidirectional flow through the neck of the aneurysm may also be seen.",

Most fistulas are asymptomatic and tend to close spontaneously within a few months. An AV fistula that fails to close would present with a bruit on auscultation. If the fistula is large enough, a pulsatile mass and groin pain may also be present. However, if an AV fistula fails to close, the patient develops limb edema, venous dilatation in the lower limb, symptoms of limb ischemia (e.g., intermittent claudication), and/or clinical features of heart failure a few months after the procedure.",

    "question_text": "Twelve hours after undergoing urgent angioplasty via arterial catheterization of the left femoral artery for critical ischemia of the left leg, a 69-year-old woman has a painful mass in the left groin. She has peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years. Current medications include enalapril, aspirin, rivaroxaban, simvastatin, metformin, and sitagliptin. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 116/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a 4-cm (1.6-in) tender, pulsatile mass in the left groin. The skin over the mass shows mild ecchymosis but no erythema. A loud bruit is heard on auscultation over this area. Examination of the lower extremities shows no peripheral edema or pulse deficit. Sensation is intact. Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations, are within normal limits. Duplex ultrasonography shows an inhomogeneous hypoechoic sac connected to the left common femoral artery, with pulsatile and turbulent bidirectional blood flow between the artery and the sac. The femoral vein does not communicate with the hematoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "A postinterventional pulsatile groin mass with a bruit on auscultation, together with ultrasound findings of a hypoechoic sac connected to the femoral artery, is in keeping with a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. The treatment thereof is determined according to the aneurysm size (more or less than 3 cm) and the presence of complications (e.g., hemodynamic instability, limb ischemia, skin necrosis, infection, rapid hematoma expansion).",

This procedure has become the gold standard for the treatment of uncomplicated postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms that measure ≥ 3 cm, and it has a success rate of > 90%. Pseudoaneurysms are most often iatrogenic (e.g., a complication of vascular puncture or cardiovascular surgery) and typically manifest within 24 hours following the procedure. In some cases, iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms only become symptomatic 7–10 days after the intervention. The incidence of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms is low: they are reported following < 1% of all diagnostic and therapeutic catheterizations.\n\nIn contrast, true aneurysms of the femoral artery usually require open surgical repair if they become symptomatic or measure ≥ 3 cm.",

However, this condition is often initially asymptomatic and manifests 48 hours to several months after the intervention. Additional symptoms typically include fatigue, lower extremity ischemia and/or edema, deep vein thrombosis, varicosis, neuropathy, and high-output cardiac failure. Moreover, duplex ultrasonography would show involvement of the femoral vein and a continuous rather than pulsatile flow. For uncomplicated pseudoaneurysms, UGC is now rarely used because it is not as effective as other procedures.",

    "question_text": "A 71-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of severe, progressive left leg pain and tingling for 8 hours. The symptoms began while he was watching television. For several months, the patient has noticed calf cramping when going for long walks, as well as occasional foot tingling and numbness, but did not seek medical attention. He has no history of recent injuries. He has poorly controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit 15 years ago. He drinks 3 beers every night. Current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, metformin, and ibuprofen. He appears to be in severe pain and is clutching his left leg. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 163/94 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is a harsh 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The left leg is cool to the touch with decreased popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses. There is 5/5 strength on left hip, knee, and ankle testing. The left hip, knee, and ankle show no effusion, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit 15 years ago. He drinks 3 beers every night. Current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, metformin, and ibuprofen. He appears to be in severe pain and is clutching his left leg. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 163/94 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is a harsh 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The left leg is cool to the touch with decreased popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses. There is 5/5 strength on left hip, knee, and ankle testing. The left hip, knee, and ankle show no effusion, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "Given this patient's history of multiple atherosclerotic risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) along with severe, acute pain, tingling, coolness, and decreased pulses in the leg, he most likely has acute limb ischemia (ALI) as a result of arterial thrombosis. The classic presentation of this condition includes the 6 Ps: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paralysis, paresthesia, and poikilothermia.",

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous antibiotic therapy, e.g., a regimen of ampicillin and sulbactam, would be appropriate for treating a patient with uncomplicated diverticulitis after imaging studies (e.g., abdominal CT) have established the diagnosis. In some cases, diverticulitis may cause septic shock, which could resemble this patient's condition. However, diverticulitis is usually a local colonic infection that presents with subacute nonradiating LLQ pain, signs of systemic infection (e.g., fever), and in the case of peritonitis, abdominal guarding, none of which are present in this patient. Regardless, if this patient did have septic shock secondary to diverticulitis, emergency surgery would likely be necessary to control the infectious focus rather than a course of IV antibiotics.",

        "explanation_why": "Supine and erect x-rays of the abdomen would be the most appropriate next step if a perforated viscus or bowel obstruction were suspected. This patient's PUD and aspirin use put him at risk of a ruptured ulcer. However, his history is not consistent with an active ulcer given his use of pantoprazole as well as the absence of any recent epigastric pain or abdominal distention and rigidity. Although the patient has signs of bowel obstruction (vomiting, no bowel movement in three days), it is less likely than AAA because obstructions usually have worsening pain over hours to days and would not cause sudden hemodynamic instability.",
        "explanation_but": "Rupture of an ulcer on the posterior duodenum or lesser stomach curvature can also result in bleeding from the gastroduodenal or the left gastric artery, respectively. Bleeding from either of these arteries could present with signs of hemorrhagic shock from intravascular blood loss, as seen in this patient. However, it would not present with a pulsatile mass.",

        "explanation_why": "Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing GCA. However, if clinical suspicion for GCA is high, initial treatment should not be delayed for diagnostic workup. Delaying treatment increases the risk of severe ischemic complications, such as temporary (e.g., amaurosis fugax) or permanent vision loss and cerebral ischemia (e.g., stroke or transient ischemic attack).",

He has been using two pillows at night but frequently wakes up feeling as if he is choking. Five months ago, he underwent surgery for the creation of an arteriovenous fistula in his left upper arm. He has hypertension and chronic kidney disease due to reflux nephropathy. He receives hemodialysis three times a week. His current medications are enalapril, vitamin D_3, erythropoietin, sevelamer, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 103/min and bounding, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 106/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. There is jugular venous distention. A prominent bruit is heard over the brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula. There are crackles heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S_3 gallop. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

The edema is caused by osmotic shifts in patients initiating dialysis for the first time and is potentially due to the rapid reduction of blood urea nitrogen.

This shunting causes a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, which results in elevated heart rate and decreased effective circulating volume, thereby triggering activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). RAAS activation, in turn, causes retention of sodium and water, resulting in increased cardiac filling pressures with elevated cardiac output, which may culminate in a state of high-output heart failure (high-output HF). This patient requires immediate surgical division of the fistula to reverse current symptoms and prevent irreversible myocardial damage.\n\nOther common causes of high-output HF include pregnancy, anemia, hyperthyroidism, and wet beriberi.",

The abdomen is distended and a shifting dullness test is positive. An ECG shows low-amplitude QRS complexes. Chest x-ray shows small pleural effusions bilaterally and calcifications over the left cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography shows a 40% decrease in the velocity of peak diastolic blood flow across the mitral valve during inspiration.

        "explanation_why": "Pericardiectomy, along with the treatment of any underlying condition (i.e., this patient's tuberculosis), is the recommended approach for constrictive pericarditis. In constrictive pericarditis, a thick, rigid, and fibrous pericardium compromises cardiac function, which is restored by the removal of the fibrotic pericardium. In patients without signs of chronic constrictive pericarditis (i.e., no pericardial calcifications, atrial fibrillation, hepatic dysfunction, anasarca, or cachexia), pharmacotherapy can be attempted first. This can include NSAIDs, colchicine, diuretics, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory therapy; these measures should also be considered as adjuncts to pericardiectomy in chronic constrictive pericarditis.\n\nIn healthy individuals, the velocity of blood flow in the left side of the heart normally decreases with inspiration. However, in patients with constrictive pericarditis, this decrease in blood flow is exaggerated (> 25% decrease in diastolic flow across the mitral valve) because the rigid, fibrotic, shell-like pericardium impedes diastolic filling due to impaired relaxation of the left ventricle. In addition to these findings, an echocardiogram would show acoustic shadowing (caused by calcifications) and thickening of the pericardium.",

She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had an 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and 2 stents were placed. Intravenous unfractionated heparin was used prior to the procedure. Prior to admission, her medications were enalapril, simvastatin, and metformin. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, and blood pressure is 109/75 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Examination shows a tender lower abdomen; there is no guarding or rigidity. There is right suprainguinal fullness and tenderness. There is no bleeding or discharge from the femoral access site. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. A complete blood count shows a hematocrit of 36%, a leukocyte count of 8400/mm^3, and a platelet count of 230,000/mm^3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

This patient received a dose of unfractionated heparin prior to surgery and active bleeding is suspected. However, unfractionated heparin has a half-life of only 30–60 minutes, and thus the remaining effect is most likely minor 1.5 hours after administration. Additionally, the decision as to whether reversal of anticoagulation is indicated in this patient should be based on the judgment of an experienced clinician and should include careful consideration of indications for anticoagulation and severity of bleeding. The diagnosis should therefore be confirmed first.",

        "explanation_why": "Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be performed in all patients with suspected retroperitoneal bleeding to confirm the diagnosis. While generally rare, retroperitoneal hemorrhage is the most common cause of unexpected mortality after diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. It often occurs when femoral access is obtained above the inguinal ligament, as compression of the puncture site is difficult in this area and sufficient hemostasis is not easily achieved. Patients usually become symptomatic after significant blood loss, which often leads to a late diagnosis of the condition. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage can also occur spontaneously or after only mild trauma in patients on oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin).",

Even if the brachial artery is not directly affected, local trauma can also induce brachial artery vasospasm, thus compromising arterial blood flow. Impaired brachial artery flow affects the distal structures supplied by this artery, so patients can have an absent or diminished radial pulse and delayed capillary refill in the affected arm. Most patients do not have a direct injury of the artery and treatment of the fracture (internal fixation) usually reduces entrapment and restores perfusion; vascular surgery is rarely needed.",

On arrival, his pulse is 105/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 115/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. An entrance wound is seen on the anteromedial surface of the right thigh 2 cm below the inguinal ligament; there is no active bleeding from the wound and no exit wound. No bruit or thrill is heard on auscultation. The pedal pulse is diminished on the right side compared to the left, and the ankle-brachial index is 0.7 for the right side. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

No bruit or thrill is heard on auscultation. The pedal pulse is diminished on the right side compared to the left, and the ankle-brachial index is 0.7 for the right side. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

He says that he has coughed up approximately half a cup of bright-red blood each time. He has had progressively worsening shortness of breath on exertion and a productive cough with occasionally blood-tinged sputum for the past 6 months. He has a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He drinks 2 to 3 beers every evening. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. His medications include amlodipine, tiotropium, and an albuterol inhaler as needed. His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 118/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 97/63 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. He appears anxious and cachectic. Auscultation of the lungs shows decreased breath sounds bilaterally. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. During the examination, the patient coughs up copious amounts of blood. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8800/mm^3, and platelet count is 160,000/mm^3. His coagulation parameters are within normal limits. Serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation of the lung fields and a 2-cm nodule in the right lower lobe. In addition to placing the patient in the right lateral decubitus position, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

However, this patient presents with signs of severe hypovolemia requiring immediate fluid resuscitation. Subclavian vein cannulation performed during emergencies is accompanied by a variety of complications such as hemothorax or pneumothorax. In addition, CVL insertion requires ultrasound guidance, which would consume valuable time in an emergency such as this. Lastly, since flow rates in CVLs are relatively low given the length of the catheter, a CVL is not the preferred access for emergency fluid resuscitation.",

This patient presents with a deformity of the right upper extremity suggestive of a fracture. IO infusion has few absolute contraindications, which include bone fractures, bones previously punctured by IO cannulation, and extremities with vascular interruption because fluids might extravasate into tissue and put the patient at risk for compartment syndrome. In addition, while the humerus is commonly used for IO line insertion in adults, other locations are more frequently used in children.",

        "explanation_why": "This child presents with typical auscultation findings of an atrial septal defect (ASD) with the fixed (no change with respiration), widely split S_2 being the most specific. Right ventricular volume overload due to the left-to-right shunt across the ASD causes a delayed closure of the pulmonary valve relative to the aortic valve. Since the right and left sides of the heart communicate, the pressure difference that normally exists during respiration evens out; therefore, the duration of the split does not change with inspiration or expiration. The increased blood flow through the right side of the heart also causes a pulmonary flow murmur, which explains the patient's systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. Some patients with ASD can also have a soft, mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border secondary to increased flow across the tricuspid valve.",

Acute tubular necrosis (e.g., due to hypoxia) is the most common cause of AKI in the postoperative period. However, the BUN:creatinine ratio is decreased (≤ 15:1) in patients with intrinsic AKI because the renal damage causes decreased urea reabsorption. This patient's increased BUN:creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is more consistent with prerenal AKI, in which urea reabsorption is increased.",

An additional finding is inferior rib notching (Roesler sign; examples indicated by arrowheads), which is produced by dilated intercostal arteries.The figure-3 sign of coarctation (indicated by red line) is seen in this patient. It is produced by prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery in combination with post-stenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The presence of bilateral rib notching indicates that the coarctation is distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries.",

In noncritical CoA, the left ventricular outflow obstruction leads to myocardial hypertrophy and increased collateral blood flow (e.g., to the intercostal arteries); rib notching occurs as a consequence of the collateral circulation between the internal thoracic and intercostal arteries and is usually a late finding (typically after 5 years of age).\n\nDoppler echocardiography is the confirmatory test of choice and should be performed in all patients with suspected CoA. It can identify the location and extent of the stenosis and show concurrent anomalies, such as a bicuspid aortic valve (present in ∼ 60% of patients).",

This patient most likely has noncritical, non-ductal-dependent CoA as there is no history of differential cyanosis. In patients with noncritical CoA, the blood flow to the lower extremities, although reduced, is typically enough to maintain normal arterial oxygen saturation and, therefore, tissue oxygenation.

She says that the symptoms started after completing a half-marathon. Shortly after the headache started, she also had weakness of the right upper extremity and sudden loss of vision in her left eye, both of which subsided after a few minutes. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. On arrival, she is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 77/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Examination shows drooping of the left eyelid and a constricted left pupil. Visual acuity in both eyes is 20/20. There is no swelling of the optic discs. Muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal bilaterally. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows no abnormalities. Duplex ultrasonography of the neck shows an absent flow in the left internal carotid artery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The skin over the right upper extremity is cooler than the left. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.

        "explanation_why": "Sulfonylureas, such as glipizide, frequently cause hypoglycemia and any combination of antidiabetic drugs is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemic episodes. Hypoglycemia can manifest with lightheadedness, weakness, blurred vision, and nausea, with improvement of symptoms after oral intake of glucose (e.g., drinking juice). However, the association between arm activity (e.g., painting a mural) and her symptoms makes a drug side effect less likely. Additionally, medication side effect would not explain decreased pulses in this patient's right arm.",

        "explanation_why": "Reversed blood flow in the right vertebral artery into the distal subclavian artery rather than towards the brainstem occurs in subclavian steal syndrome. Given this patient's vascular risk factors (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension), she most likely has an atherosclerotic occlusive plaque in the right subclavian artery. Reduced blood flow explains the heaviness, paresthesia, decreased pulses, and cooler skin of her right arm (i.e., upper extremity ischemia). Furthermore, exertion of the arm leads to retrograde blood flow through the vertebral artery so that the distal subclavian “steals” blood from the brain and causes her presyncopal symptoms (lightheadedness, nausea, and blurred vision) that resolve with rest.\n\nTreatment for subclavian steal syndrome involves control of atherosclerotic disease and antiplatelet therapy. Depending on the severity and location of the occlusion, percutaneous or open revascularization may be performed.",

            "description": "Under normal conditions, the subclavian artery distributes blood equally to the arteries in the brain and arms (A). If there is stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery, this leads to hypoperfusion of the upper extremities on the affected side (B). This is compensated by a contralateral circulation, in which there is increased blood flow from the unaffected side to the affected side via the vertebral arteries. As a result, there is hypoperfusion of the vertebrobasilar territory and corresponding central nervous system symptoms.",

However, this condition is a gradually progressive disease, unlike the acute presentation in this patient. Although patients with NPH may have a feeling of weakness and numbness, true sensory deficits or lower limb weakness severe enough to impair movement are not typically seen. Instead, gait abnormalities (typically a shuffling, wide-based gait) are usually the earliest sign.",

    "hint": "A right-to-left interatrial shunt (made apparent by a saline bubble study on echocardiography) that opens during coughing is diagnostic of patent foramen ovale (PFO). During coughing, right-to-left shunting of blood can occur through this defect because of the transiently increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation (and consequently increased right atrial pressure).",

A persistent foramen ovale occurs in approx. 25–30% of the general population and, since most patients are asymptomatic, is typically an incidental finding. A diagnostic workup (i.e., contrast echocardiography) and treatment (e.g., anticoagulation, closure of the defect) only become necessary if paradoxical embolism occurs. While this patient has a soft-mid systolic murmur that may be just an innocent heart murmur, she is well without signs of paradoxical embolism (e.g., stroke symptoms).\n\nA split S_2 during inspiration is physiological. If the S_2 splitting is fixed (persistently audible on auscultation during inspiration and expiration), there might be an underlying right ventricular overload (e.g., large atrial septal defects). PFOs are usually hemodynamically irrelevant and so do not cause fixed S_2 splitting.",

His mother says he also had difficulty getting dressed on his own. He has not had any trauma. The patient appears nervous. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 185/125 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Ophthalmic examination shows bilateral optic disc swelling. There is an abdominal bruit that is best heard at the right costovertebral angle. A complete blood count is within normal limits. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

Imaging would typically show a single or multiple stenoses of the renal arteries. Other imaging methods that can be used to diagnose FMD are duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography. The choice of method depends mostly on expertise and availability at individual institutions. After this patient's blood pressure has been adequately controlled and the diagnosis has been confirmed, the renal artery stenosis should be treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.",

The most common triggers are stress and trauma, especially from dental procedures. The episodes are usually self-limited and resolve within 2–4 days.

Compression ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state; the risk of venous thromboembolisms reaches its peak in the first 6 weeks postpartum, when hypercoagulability is accompanied by endothelial injury (e.g., due to surgical delivery) and possibly venous stasis (e.g., due to immobilization after delivery). Smoking also increases the risk of DVT, as does delivery via cesarean section, maternal age > 35 years, and preterm delivery. LMWH, administered subcutaneously, is the initial treatment of choice because of its immediate antithrombotic effect and safety during breastfeeding. If no significant bleeding has occurred, it can safely be started 12 hours after cesarean section.",

        "explanation_why": "Surgical fasciotomy is the treatment of choice to relieve the pressure, and thus, restore perfusion in patients with compartment syndrome. Acute compartment syndrome is a possible cause of postpartum limb pain, as it can be triggered by intrapartum hypotension (e.g., due to blood loss) or after the application of vasoconstrictive therapeutic agents (e.g., oxytocin to induce labor). In the early stages, it can manifest with swelling, paresthesia, and pain that is exacerbated by passive stretching or extension of the muscles; distal pulses are often initially palpable and do not rule out the diagnosis. However, physical examination typically shows very tight, “wood-like” muscles. This patient's examination findings suggest deep venous thrombosis rather than compartment syndrome.",

Although ALI can manifest with acute pain, it is unlikely to cause significant swelling, redness, and a positive Homan sign. Instead, patients with ALI typically have a source of arterial embolus (e.g., atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction) and present with a cool limb, decreased peripheral pulses, and possibly sensory symptoms.",

Although this patient has a DVT, it is located in the popliteal vein rather than the proximal ileofemoral vein, which indicates that another step is more appropriate. Additionally, this patient's recent surgery (cesarean section) is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy.",

A positive Homan sign, however, is not typical of this condition. Furthermore, the lack of a possible portal of entry (e.g., minor skin injury) makes this diagnosis less likely. Though cellulitis of the breast is a possible complication of breastfeeding that most commonly occurs within the first 4 weeks after delivery, cellulitis of a limb is not a typical complication of the postpartum period.",

        "explanation_why": "Warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) is commonly prescribed for oral anticoagulation in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT); however, it is not indicated as initial monotherapy in patients with acute DVT. Warfarin monotherapy induces a transient hypercoagulable state in the first few days of therapy as it decreases anticoagulant proteins C and S because of their shorter half-life (6–10h) before reducing the coagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X (half-life of 2–4 days). To not worsen the patient's DVT and/or cause warfarin-induced skin necrosis, the initial therapy must contain another drug that has an immediate antithrombotic effect, before introducing an oral anticoagulation (bridging therapy).",

This patient's physical examination findings (e.g., fever, leg swelling, erythema, warmth) shortly after surgical delivery suggest postpartum deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rather than lymphedema. In this case, graduated compression stockings can be used to decrease pain and edema of acute DVT, but they would not prevent clot lysis or propagation.",

        "explanation_why": "A decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) can be seen with impaired left ventricular (LV) contractility or an increase in afterload. Pulmonary embolism may result in a decrease in cardiac output but the LVEF is usually normal because LV systolic function and LV contractility remain unaffected. Instead, a dilated right ventricle with a decreased right ventricular ejection fraction would be more typical for patients with severe PE.\n\nThe physiological increase in cardiac output during pregnancy and/or maternal comorbidities such as anemia and hyperthyroidism can place the myocardium under hypoxic stress. This stress can worsen an underlying heart disease (e.g., arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, rheumatic aortic stenosis) and cause heart failure with decreased LVEF. Other causes of a decreased LVEF that are unique to pregnancy include severe gestational hypertension and peripartum cardiomyopathy.",

Amniotic fluid embolism to the lungs can manifest with pleuritis and preeclampsia with pedal edema. However, patients with DIC would usually present with features of shock (e.g., cold clammy extremities, hypotension, altered mental status) and/or bleeding manifestations. Moreover, there is no history of gestational hypertension or a risk factor for amniotic fluid embolism in this patient (e.g., uterine rupture, a recent amniocentesis).",

An acute myocardial infarction (MI) can result in chest pain but the chest pain would usually be continuous without exacerbation during inspiration.

An increase in pain with inspiration along with evidence of pleural effusion (decreased breath sounds) indicates a pleuritic cause for chest pain. Moreover, in patients with CHF, peripheral edema would be symmetrical, pleural effusions would occur bilaterally (or more commonly in the right side if unilateral), and basal crepitations would be expected.",

Common sites of embolism include the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries (saddle thrombus), within the right and/or left pulmonary artery, and within the lobar, segmental, or subsegmental branch of the pulmonary arteries.

In response to decreased cardiac output, there is compensatory activation of the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system, resulting in increased TPR. In addition, incomplete ventricular emptying during systole results in left ventricular volume overload, which results in increased LVEDV. Increased LVEDV and poor forward flow cause increased left ventricular pressure, which is transmitted to the left atrium, resulting in increased PCWP.",

The pain used to only occur after long walks and subside with rest. For the past week, the pain has been continuous and associated with burning sensations. He has also had transient painful nodules along the course of the leg veins for 4 months that resolve spontaneously. The patient is wearing an ankle brace for support because of a sprained left ankle that occurred 3 months ago. His mother was diagnosed with protein C deficiency as a teenager. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years and does not drink alcohol. Vitals signs are within normal limits. Examination shows ulcers on the distal portion of his left great, second, and fifth toes. The feet are cool. Pedal pulses are barely palpable. Ankle-brachial pressure index is 0.3 in the left leg and 0.5 in the right leg. Which of the following interventions is most likely to decrease the risk of amputation in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "In patients with peripheral arterial disease, the use of compression stockings is contraindicated if the ankle-brachial index is < 0.6 because it can exacerbate lower limb ischemia. Instead, they are indicated in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which can manifest with pain in the lower limb and lower limb ulcers. However, CVI causes a “dragging” pain that is worsened by prolonged standing and relieved by walking or lying down with the lower limbs elevated, and venous ulcers typically occur over the shin and medial malleolus. Moreover, the skin surrounding the ulcers would be hyperpigmented and/or thickened, and a history of lower limb edema and/or varicose veins would be present. Also, CVI typically occurs in elderly patients.",

Anticoagulation should instead be used in a patient with acute limb ischemia (ALI), which can manifest similarly with painful cold limbs bilaterally if a saddle thrombus occurs. A family history of protein C deficiency is also a risk factor for thrombosis. However, with ALI, the onset of symptoms would be acute (as the name suggests!), the pedal pulses would be absent rather than decreased, and paralysis of the lower limbs would be expected.

He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension treated with atorvastatin and labetalol. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 35 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 4-cm (1.6-in), nontender, pulsatile mass with a palpable thrill at the right midinguinal point. On auscultation, a harsh bruit is heard over the mass. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, an inguinal hernia is not pulsatile and does not have a palpable thrill or a bruit on auscultation.

However, spontaneous pseudoaneurysms are very rare, occurring in patients with underlying vasculitides (e.g., Behcet disease) or connective tissue disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms typically follow an iatrogenic intervention on the femoral artery (e.g., cardiac catheterization, femoral ABG, surgery) or trauma (e.g., gunshot wound) to the inguinal region. This patient does not have a preceding history of femoral artery trauma/intervention and has no features of other underlying disorders, making this diagnosis highly unlikely.",

Left pedal pulses are 1+; right pedal pulses are absent. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is 0.65 in the right leg and 0.9 in the left leg.

This patient's history of smoking, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus puts him at increased risk of PAD. However, symptoms of acute-on-chronic limb ischemia are usually less severe and develop within a few hours to a few days because of the collateral blood circulation.

        "explanation_why": "Sudden onset of ALI in a previously asymptomatic patient (no trauma and no features of peripheral artery disease such as claudication) is most likely caused by arterial embolism. Arterial embolisms most commonly originate from a cardiac thrombus, which typically forms if there is intracardiac blood stasis (e.g., due to atrial fibrillation or complications of myocardial infarction such as noncontractile myocardium or ventricular aneurysm). This patient’s sensory loss and muscle weakness strongly suggest that the right limb is under immediate threat. Management of ALI in a viable or threatened limb begins with an IV heparin bolus followed by continuous infusion and emergent revascularization (via catheter-directed thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thromboembolectomy, or open thromboembolectomy) to restore blood flow to the extremity.\n\nALI most commonly results from the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque or thrombosis in a previously stenotic but patent artery, such as those in patients with PAD. In PAD, collateral circulation often gradually develops, which protects against sudden, severe ischemia. Therefore, in patients with PAD, the manifestation of ALI is typically less severe than arterial embolism and symptoms usually develop within a few hours to a few days (i.e., acute-on-chronic limb ischemia)",

        "explanation_why": "Cholesterol embolism (CE) can occur after coronary stent placement and may manifest with symptoms of ALI. However, CE typically clogs small to medium-sized vessels, resulting in insidious organ damage (especially with renal involvement) and/or skin changes (e.g., livedo reticularis, blue toe syndrome). In addition, CE most commonly manifests shortly after the vascular intervention when cholesterol is released from atherosclerotic plaques, whereas this patient's symptoms began one month after stent placement.",

The foot tingling on leg elevation is due to the decrease in arterial blood flow to the limb when raised above the level of the heart (usually insignificant, but can cause symptoms in patients with preexisting arterial insufficiency). The cramping pain upon exertion (e.g., walking on the treadmill) and relief at rest are characteristic of intermittent claudication (stage II according to Fontaine classification), which is a symptom of arterial insufficiency. Chronic smoking, hypertension, advanced age, and male gender are all significant risk factors for the development of PAD.",

If no pallor occurs, ask the patient to plantarflex and dorsiflex or to rotate their feet a few times, looking for exercise-induced pallor.Next, ask the patient to sit up with their legs hanging off the examination table and evaluate the time taken for the color to return to the feet and for the veins to fill again.Foot pallor on elevation, or reactive hyperemia or delayed venous refilling on dependency, indicate arterial insufficiency (positive Buerger sign). A venous filling time of > 20 seconds may indicate advanced ischemia.",

This patient's laboratory studies show elevated creatinine and borderline normal BUN level, which suggest impaired kidney function. Therefore, urgent prophylactic hydration is vital in this patient. Laboratory monitoring is necessary following the procedure to detect worsening creatinine levels (typically highest after 3–5 days), which would indicate contrast-induced nephropathy.\n\nNSAIDs should be avoided prior to, and for several hours after, administering intravascular contrast medium because they cause renal vasoconstriction and subsequently increase the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.

Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on medications. Since the diagnosis was made, his medications have been adjusted several times because of persistently high blood pressure readings. He also has hypercholesterolemia and peripheral arterial disease. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years but quit two months ago. His current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, losartan, felodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. He is 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 109 kg (240 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. His pulse is 82/min and blood pressure is 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilateral carotid bruits and normal heart sounds. Serum potassium concentration is 3.2 mEq/L, plasma renin activity is 4.5 ng/mL/h(N = 0.3–4.2), and serum creatinine concentration is 1.5 mg/dL.

        "explanation_why": "Conservative therapy with observation, blood pressure control, and analgesia is appropriate for most patients with uncomplicated descending aortic dissections (Stanford type B). Blood pressure control is essential in all patients with aortic dissection to prevent further progression of the dissection. Intravenous beta blockers (e.g., labetalol, esmolol) lower the heart rate and reduce the left ventricular ejection fraction, thereby reducing shearing forces within the aorta. If IV beta blocker therapy does not lower systolic blood pressure to 90–120 mm Hg, patients should also receive vasodilators (e.g., sodium nitroprusside). To avoid reflex tachycardia, beta-blocker therapy should be started before vasodilators.\n\nPatients with uncomplicated type B dissections do not require surgical intervention unless they develop complications (e.g., aortic rupture, renal failure, abdominal pain due to intestinal ischemia). Patients treated conservatively who develop worsening pain or features suggestive of complications should have vascular imaging repeated immediately.",

He has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and metformin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. He is in acute distress. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Cardiac examination shows a grade 3/6, high-pitched, blowing, diastolic murmur heard best over the right sternal border. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia and left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Aortic dissection typically occurs in males 60–80 years of age with hypertension. It causes sudden severe pain, typically of the anterior chest (in an ascending dissection) or the back and interscapular region (in a descending dissection), which can migrate as the dissection progresses. Other clinical features include elevated blood pressure, asymmetrical blood pressure and pulse readings between limbs, diminished distal pulses, syncope, sweating, and confusion. Aortic dissection manifests as a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Extension of the dissection into the aortic valve causes aortic regurgitation. However, unlike the murmur of aortic regurgitation from aortic valve disease, which is prominent along the left sternal border, the murmur of aortic regurgitation from aortic dissection is prominent along the right sternal border.",

This patient has a saccular AAA that has rapidly grown over the past year and therefore requires surgery.

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Sudden and severe tearing pain, asymmetrical blood pressure readings, and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray are consistent with aortic dissection. Uncontrolled hypertension and chronic smoking are independent risk factors for aortic dissection. The moderate pulmonary hyperinflation in this patient is not the result of aortic dissection but caused by the concomitant COPD.",

Spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema can occur following spontaneous esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome), which can manifest with acute-onset chest pain and mediastinal widening (due to a pneumomediastinum). However, Boerhaave syndrome is usually preceded by a history of vomiting and/or severe retching, and features such as asymmetrical blood pressure readings are not be expected.",

If the dissection results in a tear of the tunica externa, aortic blood can leak into the pericardium. Pericardial fluid will decrease the transmission of heart sounds to the precordium.\n\nOther possible complications of ascending aortic dissections include myocardial infarction (due to coronary artery occlusion), aortic regurgitation (extension of the dissection into the aortic valve), and stroke (extension of the dissection into the carotids).",

An aortic dissection can result in acute pericarditis, which, in turn, can cause constrictive pericarditis.

In contrast, other sites of supratentorial hemorrhage typically cause a gaze deviation toward the side of the lesion (i.e., away from the affected side of the body). This patient’s left-sided weakness and sensory loss, miotic nonreactive pupils, and leftward and downward deviation of her eyes are best explained by a stroke in the right thalamus.\n\nNote that the thalamus is a relatively large region of the brain and thalamic stroke has a variety of manifestations (e.g., pure sensory stroke in lacunar syndromes). However, “wrong way eyes” is a classical finding of thalamic hemorrhage.",

Extensive cancer screening (e.g., using abdomen or pelvic CT scans, upper GI endoscopy) is not routinely recommended.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends colon cancer screening in all adults between 45 and 75 years.

Afterwards, the patient reports shortness of breath and chest pain with deep inspiration. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit prior to admission to the hospital. He does not drink alcohol. He is in distress and appears ill. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 135/min and weak, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Physical examination shows jugular venous distention. Cardiac examination shows a regular, rapid heart rate and a holosystolic murmur that increases during inspiration. His abdomen is soft and mildly tender to palpation around the surgical site. Examination of his extremities shows pitting edema of the left leg. His skin is cold and clammy. Further examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

A massive pulmonary embolism (PE) causes elevation of pulmonary artery pressures, leading to right ventricular pressure overload and dilation (right heart strain). Right ventricular dysfunction ultimately leads to decreased left atrial filling and left ventricular cardiac output, and eventually to obstructive shock. This patient shows evidence of hemodynamic instability from PE, so a dilated right ventricular cavity and tricuspid regurgitation would be expected findings on echocardiography.\n\nFurther findings on echocardiography in patients with massive PE include dilation of the inferior vena cava and decreased contractility of the right ventricular free wall with normal apical movement (McConnell sign).",

Hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain further suggest that PE is complicated by pulmonary infarction, which occurs when the thrombus occludes a smaller segmental artery, resulting in inflammation of the lung parenchyma. The typical CT finding in patients with pulmonary infarction caused by PE is a wedge-shaped opacity near the pleura that does not enhance with contrast. The apex of the wedge is closest to the site of the arterial occlusion, with a triangular area of nonperfusion where the downstream vascular supply is cut off. A wedge-shaped opacity may very rarely be seen on chest x-ray in patients with pulmonary embolism; this radiographic finding is also referred to as Hampton hump.\n\nThe imaging modality of choice to confirm PE is CT pulmonary angiography, which shows a filling defect of the obstructed pulmonary arteries. This confirmatory finding is also seen in patients without concomitant pulmonary infarction.",

Radiation to the area between the scapulae is also very common. Aortic dissection is associated with asymmetrical blood pressure in the upper extremities and can progress to cardiac tamponade (ascending dissection), which leads to hypotension and cardiogenic shock. This patient has none of these symptoms. Furthermore, the presence of ST elevations on ECG would be a rare finding with aortic dissection, making a different cause much more likely. In rare cases in which aortic dissection propagates all the way to the aortic root and the coronary ostia are occluded by the false lumen of the dissection, ST elevations may be present.

    "hint": "Acute confusion, hemiparesis, and slurred speech are signs of an acute cerebrovascular accident. The full reversal of all neurologic symptoms within 1 hour and absence of signs of ischemia on neuroimaging makes a transient ischemic attack (TIA) very likely in this patient. In addition, this patient has an irregular pulse and, on ECG, irregularly spaced QRS complexes and no distinct P waves, all of which are characteristic findings in atrial fibrillation (Afib).",

In women with Afib and a CHA_2DS_2-VASc score ≥ 3 (and men with a score ≥ 2), oral anticoagulation with either warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), e.g., rivaroxaban, is indicated. This patient's score is 6 (+1 for age 65–74 years, +1 for female sex category, +1 for history of hypertension, +2 for history of TIA, and +1 for history of diabetes mellitus). DOACs are preferred over warfarin in the long-term management of most patients with atrial fibrillation with an indication for anticoagulation. Exceptions include patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, mechanical heart valve, and chronic severe kidney disease.\n\nGenerally, patients with TIA should receive immediate antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin) unless they have a clear indication for anticoagulation at initial presentation (e.g., Afib).

        "explanation_why": "As evidenced by his increased aPTT and normal PT, this patient was given subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), formerly called type 2 HIT, is a rare, immune-mediated adverse effect of heparin. The risk of developing this condition is higher with unfractionated heparin but can also occur in patients treated with low molecular weight heparin. HIT typically occurs 5–14 days after initiation of heparin and can result in thrombotic events (e.g., arterial occlusion). Although HIT is characterized by thrombocytopenia, bleeding manifestations are rare as the platelet count rarely decreases below 20,000 platelets/mm^3. The diagnosis is confirmed by serum immunoassays to detect anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies but heparin should be immediately stopped without waiting for diagnostic confirmation and nonheparin anticoagulation should be initiated.\n\nHIT should be differentiated from the more common nonimmune heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (formerly called type 1 HIT), which occurs within 5 days of heparin initiation and is a transient, clinically insignificant, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia that can be managed with serial monitoring of platelet counts and does not require discontinuation of heparin.",

Furthermore, DIC also causes bleeding manifestations (e.g., petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses, bleeding from venipuncture sites) and, since DIC is a consumption coagulopathy, the PT value would also be increased.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Failure of the ductus arteriosus to completely close postnatally allows blood to flow from the descending aorta back to the pulmonary artery (left-to-right shunt). In a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), this leads to volume overload of the right ventricle and the lung circuit. This increased blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension and irreversible remodeling of small pulmonary vessels, which may eventually lead to an Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). This patient's palpable right parasternal heave and pronounced S_2 are evidence of increased right heart strain. In patients with a large PDA, the features of differential cyanosis occur once shunt reversal develops. Because the ductus is located on the descending aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, reversal of the shunt results in deoxygenated blood reaching only the lower body. Due to the rise in pulmonary pressure, the characteristic continuous machine-like murmur heard in patients with PDA eventually disappears.\n\nInfants with PDA usually receive an infusion of indomethacin to induce closure of the duct, while in older children symptomatic PDAs are typically closed surgically or via percutaneous catheter occlusion. The presence of an Eisenmenger reaction is, however, a contraindication to a PDA closure.",

        "explanation_why": "Abnormal narrowing at the aortic isthmus is consistent with coarctation of the aorta (CoA), which would cause differential cyanosis if the CoA is severe (i.e., a ductal-dependent congenital heart defect) but this differential cyanosis would be evident from the neonatal period. In addition, patients with CoA have a brachio-femoral pulse delay rather than synchronous pulses. The symptoms of a mild CoA can begin later in life but in such a scenario, differential cyanosis would not be expected. Instead, patients present with features of brachiocephalic hypertension (e.g., headaches, epistaxis), lower extremity arterial insufficiency (manifesting with claudication and cool skin with faint or unpalpable pulses, but no cyanosis), and evidence of compensatory collateral arteries (e.g., continuous murmur over the back).",

His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure in the right arm is 130/85 mm Hg. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard in the left paravertebral region. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

Those vessels may dilate to bypass the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Although this patient may eventually develop visible rib notching, it is generally a sign of chronic disease and usually does not become apparent in children before the age of 5 years.",

An additional finding is inferior rib notching (Roesler sign; examples indicated by arrowheads), which is produced by dilated intercostal arteries.The figure-3 sign of coarctation (indicated by red line) is seen in this patient. It is produced by prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery in combination with post-stenotic dilatation of the descending aorta. The presence of bilateral rib notching indicates that the coarctation is distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries.",

In such patients, blood pressure in the right arm would be markedly higher than in the left arm and oxygen saturation would be lower in the left arm. However, coarctation of the aorta most commonly presents with differences in blood pressure between the upper and the lower extremities.",

While myocardial hypertrophy is one of the compensatory mechanisms to counter the aortic narrowing in patients with coarctation of the aorta, such as this 3-year-old boy, the changes in ECG vary with age and degree of stenosis, and it usually takes several years before the hypertrophy becomes apparent. In older children and adults, ECG may show signs of left ventricular hypertrophy in the left precordial leads (e.g., positive Sokolow-Lyon criteria).",

Neonates with HLHS also have weak peripheral pulses, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis as the hypoplastic left ventricle cannot maintain adequate cardiac output.

Exertion, such as crying or feeding, increases the RVOO. This results in cyanosis (tet spells) due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD instead of the pulmonary valve, which in turn causes the murmur to become softer. The right ventricle hypertrophies because it chronically pumps against high resistance caused by the RVOO.\n\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during a tet spell. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases left ventricular pressure and decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the VSD. Infants who are having a tet spell should be placed with their knees toward their chest to achieve the same effect.",

            "title": "Cardiac hemodynamics in ventricular septal defect",
            "description": "A defect in the ventricular septum leads to a left-to-right shunt, the volume of which is dependent on the size of the defect. Blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (white arrow) along the pressure gradient (1). This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

Coronary atherosclerosis leads to narrowing of the arterial lumen, which decreases the blood flow to the myocardium. During exercise, myocardial flow is unable to meet increased myocardial demand, which causes myocardial ischemia and symptoms of angina. While smoking increases the risk for MI, this man's history of acute onset, stabbing abdominal pain with an umbilical mass and hypotension suggest a different disease process.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient most likely has a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The pathophysiology of AAA is not fully understood, but numerous genetic and environmental factors, such as smoking, are believed to cause inflammation and proteolysis of connective tissue within the aortic wall. This leads to loss of structural integrity and weakening of the aorta. Other risk factors for AAA include advanced age and male sex. When high aortic wall stress is applied, as in hypertension, further weakening, widening, and rupture of the aortic wall can occur. AAAs are most commonly located below the renal arteries (infrarenal).",

The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) arises from the anterior surface of the aorta at the level of the L3 vertebra. Occlusion at the opening of the IMA by a thrombus within an aortic aneurysm (suggested by the filling defect) would cause acute mesenteric ischemia and, potentially, necrosis of the bowel segments supplied by this artery.",

Because previously γ-carboxylated factors are still present, the anticoagulative effect does not occur immediately. Therefore, warfarin is the drug given for long-term anticoagulation (e.g., post-MI, heart valve damage, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmias).

Citrate is an anticoagulant that is central to the storage of blood products. During transfusion, citrate prevents activation of the clotting cascade by chelating free extracellular calcium (a necessary cofactor for many steps in the coagulation cascade), resulting in transient hypocalcemia post-transfusion. In patients with symptomatic hypocalcemia, as seen here, calcium replacement therapy must be administered.",

However, ionized (or free) calcium concentrations are regulated hormonally and thus will not be affected. Since only ionized calcium is biologically active, hypocalcemia due to hypoalbuminemia usually is asymptomatic (pseudohypocalcemia) and would not explain this patient's symptoms.",

Affected patients will present within 1 hour of transfusion with hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, caused by destruction of donor RBCs by recipient antibodies. Symptoms include fever, flushing, pruritus, flank pain, dyspnea and a burning pain at the IV site; none of which are present in this patient. Hemoglobinuria and subsequent renal tubular necrosis may follow. Hypocalcemia, however, does not typically occur as part of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.",

Patients typically present with severe, tearing chest pain, hypertension, and asymmetric pulses. Hypotension, severe dyspnea, and cough are less common manifestations of type A aortic dissection. The patient's CT scan also shows a vascular filling defect consistent with a pulmonary embolism rather than a tear in the aortic intima, which would be typical in a case of dissection.",

The aortic arch and descending aorta are not affected. The right and left coronary, the innominate, the left common carotid, and the subclavian arteries originate from the true lumen (green overlay; false lumen is red overlay). Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta. Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen.Additional findings include sternotomy wires, a prosthetic aortic valve, atherosclerotic calcifications, pancreatic calcifications, and a small hiatal hernia.LCA: left coronary artery; RCA: right coronary artery; yellow overlay: azygos vein",

In cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability (e.g., SBP < 90 mm Hg), thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) such as alteplase is indicated. Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment. Anticoagulation with heparin, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or apixaban is also appropriate treatment for patients with PE. However, these agents are typically used in patients who remain hemodynamically stable.",

It may arise directly from the subclavian artery (as shown here) or from the aortic arch or the brachiocephalic artery. It enters the thyroid at the inferior border of the isthmus.Venous drainage occurs via a venous plexus on the anterior surface of the thyroid (plexus thyroideus impar) that is drained by three paired veins:\n- The superior thyroid veins drain into the internal jugular vein.\n- The middle thyroid veins also drain into the internal jugular vein.\n- The inferior thyroid veins drain into the brachiocephalic veins.",

Inflammatory cytokines attract macrophages, which then form foam cells by taking up cholesterol from oxidized low-density lipids. These foam cells accumulate to form fatty streaks (early atherosclerotic lesions). Finally, collagen production by lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells form these fatty streaks into a fibrous plaque.",

PAD is strongly associated with diabetes, hypertension, and smoking, all of which are present in this case. The disease begins with the buildup of lipids and fibrous material beneath the tunica intima in peripheral arteries. With time, focal accumulation of these substances can cause stenosis and reduced blood flow to downstream tissues, manifesting as episodic ischemia (in this case, claudication). Typical physical exam findings include decreased or absent peripheral pulses, atrophic skin changes (i.e., dry, shiny, or hairless skin), or chronically non-healing foot wounds. The diagnosis is confirmed via ankle-brachial index.",

        "explanation_why": "Systemic hyperplastic arteriosclerosis is a form of small vessel disease that typically arises in the setting of severe hypertension (≥ 180/120 mmHg). The intimal response to sustained blood pressures in this range results in a characteristic “onion skin” appearance on histological examination of vascular tissue. This process classically causes ischemic damage in the kidneys, but it is not implicated in cases of vascular insufficiency in the extremities. Moreover, this patient's blood pressure is only 140/92 mm Hg, which is much lower than what is necessary to cause hyperplastic arteriosclerosis.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "An aortic dissection is typically caused by a tear in the tunica intima and subsequent longitudinal extension of the dissecting hematoma. Hypertension, which increases the risk of endothelial injury, is the most common predisposing factor for aortic dissection. Most aortic dissections begin in the ascending portion of the thoracic aorta because this is the region of maximum hydraulic stress. Patients present with sudden and severe pain in the chest or interscapular region. The pain can migrate as the dissection progresses. Proximal extension of the dissection into the aortic valve ring can cause acute aortic regurgitation (AR), as seen here. Other features of aortic dissection include syncope, diminished distal pulses, and asymmetrical blood pressure and pulse readings between limbs. Unlike the murmur of AR from aortic valve disease, which is prominent along the left sternal border, the murmur of AR from aortic dissection is prominent along the right sternal border.\n\nNonmodifiable risk factors for aortic dissection include advanced age, male sex, and certain genetic conditions that weaken the tunica media (e.g., Marfan syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome).",

            "description": "A tear in the tunica intima (entry tear on illustration) allows blood to enter into the tunica media. The column of blood then extends longitudinally, most commonly in the outer half of the tunica media. This creates a false lumen, which may rupture back into the true lumen of the aorta (reentry tear on illustration) or rupture through the tunica adventitia.",

Atherosclerosis is implicated in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms; atheroma ulceration has been reported in some patients with abdominal aortic dissections and descending thoracic aortic dissections. Although both aortic dissection and atherosclerosis share similar risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension, advanced age, and male sex), atherosclerosis is not a major risk factor for most aortic dissections, which tend to occur in the ascending aorta.",

The typical duration is two weeks, after which treatment is switched to an extended duration oral anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin). The specific agent and exact duration of treatment, however, are variable as no consensus guidelines exist to guide this therapy. In the rare event of progressive neurological compromise despite adequate anticoagulation, local thrombolysis may also be required.\n\nRisk factors for CVT include oral contraceptive use (as seen here), pregnancy, coagulation disorders, and malignancy.",

Normally, the small saphenous vein would arise from the dorsal venous arch and drain into the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction. In a patient with chronic venous disease, however, incompetence of the venous valves caused by elevated venous pressure (e.g., due to pregnancy, increased BMI, prior thrombosis) leads to blood reflux from deep into superficial veins. This results in the formation of varicose veins, and ultimately edema and skin changes (e.g., stasis dermatitis), as seen in this patient. First-line treatment consists of conservative measures such as leg elevation, compression therapy, and application of topical dermatologic agents.",

It terminates by draining into the femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction, which is typically located ~4 cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle.\n- Short saphenous vein: arises from the lateral end of the dorsal venous arch, courses behind the lateral malleolus, and up the posterior aspect of the leg. It terminates by draining into the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction, which usually lies in the popliteal fossa (not shown here).The deep veins are depicted in the left leg:\n- Peripheral deep veins: anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular (peroneal) veins\n- Popliteal vein: formed by the confluence of the peripheral deep veins\n- Femoral vein: continuation of the popliteal vein. It begins at the adductor hiatus and accompanies the femoral artery throughout its course. The deep femoral vein (profunda femoris) is the main tributary of the femoral vein.\n- External iliac vein: continuation of the femoral vein. It begins behind the inguinal ligament and drains into the common iliac vein.",

        "explanation_why": "Bidirectional blood flow in the great saphenous vein on duplex ultrasonography, rather than the normal unilateral blood flow from the superficial to the deep system, is diagnostic of chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors for chronic venous disease in this patient include female sex, family history of vascular disease (her father died from an ischemic stroke at a young age), pregnancy, obesity, and prolonged standing (i.e., work as a high school librarian). Elevated venous pressure leads to the incompetence of venous valves, causing reflux of blood into superficial veins, resulting in further elevation of venous pressure and the formation of varicose veins. Edema that worsens with standing and improves with leg elevation indicates progression of her venous disease due to damage to the capillary basement membrane. If this patient's chronic venous insufficiency remains untreated, she may develop chronic venous stasis ulcers.\n\nConservative measures for chronic venous disease include compression therapy with compression stockings, frequent elevation of the legs, physical therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and avoidance of heat and long periods of standing or sitting with bent legs.",

This condition typically develops within days to weeks after surgery, as seen in this patient. Other postoperative complications (e.g., infection, ischemia) must be ruled out to make a diagnosis of phantom limb pain. Treatment options include mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, NMDA receptor antagonists, and other adjuvant therapies (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants).",

This patient's syncope, palpitations, and tachycardia with an irregular pulse suggest atrial fibrillation. Blood stasis in the atria (in atrial fibrillation) or in the ventricles (in ventricular aneurysm) results in the formation of thrombi, which can embolize into the systemic circulation, thereby occluding the peripheral arteries. Other common causes of acute limb ischemia include thrombosis of a previously patent artery, dissection, trauma, and stent or graft occlusion.",

This patient's low fasting glucose levels, increased serum concentration of C-peptide and insulin levels, and a mass in the pancreatic tail on imaging suggests an insulinoma, a neuroendocrine tumor that most commonly arise from pancreatic β-cells. When resecting an insulinoma in the tail of the pancreas (distal pancreatectomy), the surgeon will dissect the splenorenal ligament and possibly the spleen (because of the high risk of splenic metastasis in the case of neuroendocrine tumors). Therefore, the splenic artery and vein are at greatest risk of being damaged during this procedure.",

He undergoes closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. The day after his surgery, he is crying and has severe left arm pain. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/76 mm Hg. When his fingers are extended passively, he yells in agony and says the pain is even worse. After the cast is removed, physical examination shows a diffuse firm swelling of the forearm and severe pain with palpation. The left radial pulse is palpable and the capillary refill time is 2 seconds. Which of the following is the most appropriate study to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Severely tender forearm swelling accompanied by excruciating pain that worsens with palpation and passive muscle stretch in a patient with a history of bone fractures is suggestive of acute compartment syndrome. Palpable pulses and a normal capillary refill time indicate an early, reversible presentation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Needle manometry confirms the diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) by measuring compartment pressure. As compartment pressure approaches diastolic pressure, blood supply is increasingly compromised. A delta pressure (diastolic pressure - compartment pressure) of ≤ 30 mm Hg is diagnostic of ACS. If needle manometry is not readily available and ACS is highly suspected, a confirmatory test is unnecessary and the patient must undergo emergency forearm fasciotomy. Fasciotomy must be performed within 4–6 hours of symptom onset to prevent muscle and soft tissue necrosis and irreversible nerve damage. Ischemic features (e.g., pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia, paralysis, increased capillary refill time) are usually late findings of ACS (typically occurring 4–6 hours after symptom onset) and are associated with a poor prognosis.",

This patient has acute compartment syndrome (ACS), and his palpable pulses and normal capillary refill time indicate that he has not yet developed acute limb ischemia. In ACS, arteriography will show a filling defect only if muscle compartment pressure exceeds arterial blood pressure and collapses arteries, which occurs late in the course of the condition. Therefore, arteriography is not appropriate for diagnosing ACS.",

He had no other symptoms and says he has never had a similar episode before. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 48 years and drinks one beer daily. Current medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, and metformin. He is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 89 kg (196 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m^2. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 72/min and regular, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 148/91 mm Hg. Visual acuity is 20/32 bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye (N = 10–21). The pupil is reactive and the cornea and anterior chamber are clear. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a few microaneurysms, increased tortuosity of the retinal arterioles, and bright yellow, refractile bodies at the bifurcations of the retinal arterioles. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's loss of vision?",

His fundoscopic examination shows Hollenhorst plaques (bright, yellow, refractile bodies at the bifurcations of the retinal arterioles), which are consistent with cholesterol crystal embolization.

However, these spots would be clustered around the macula rather than the bifurcations of the retinal arterioles and dry AMD does not cause acute visual impairment.\n\nWet AMD can lead to subretinal hemorrhage, manifesting with acute monocular visual impairment. This patient does not have subretinal hemorrhage or any other signs of wet AMD (e.g., gray-green retinal discoloration, serous detachment of the retina) on fundoscopic examination and contrary to this patient's presentation, visual impairment after subretinal hemorrhage resolves slowly over several weeks.",

Medical history is remarkable for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, propranolol, and apixaban. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 95/min and irregular, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 99/71 mm Hg. Examination shows a firm, tender mass in the left lower quadrant near the midline. The mass does not expand upon coughing. Active straight leg raise in the supine position increases pain and prominence of the mass but causes no change in the location of the mass. Palpation of the other abdominal quadrants shows no abnormalities. Bowel sounds are normal. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's findings?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Accumulation of blood within the rectus sheath causes a rectus sheath hematoma (RSH). This condition typically results from a sudden, forceful contraction of the rectus abdominis muscle (RAM) causing a tear in an epigastric artery or in the RAM itself. RSH manifests with acute abdominal pain and a tender mass that is located within the abdominal wall and does not cross the midline. Carnett sign and Fothergill sign, both seen here, are characteristic of this condition. If the RSH is large enough, the patient may develop hypovolemia, signs that mimic peritonitis (e.g., abdominal guarding), and abdominal compartment syndrome. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT is used to confirm the diagnosis of RSH. Management includes treating the underlying cause (e.g., treatment of severe hypertension, reversal of anticoagulation) and providing hemodynamic support as needed. Selective arterial embolization and surgery are reserved for severe cases (e.g., refractory hypovolemia, abdominal compartment syndrome).",

However, an ovarian cyst is an intraabdominal mass and would, therefore, become less prominent with maneuvers that tense the abdominal musculature. Furthermore, a ruptured ovarian cyst is more common in women of reproductive age. Patients may also present with vaginal bleeding and peritoneal signs, none of which are seen here.",

A Spigelian hernia can manifest as a mass in the left lower quadrant and a hernia can become more prominent with maneuvers that tense the abdominal wall (as a result of increased intraabdominal pressure). However, incarcerated hernias are usually not tender and most commonly manifest with an expansile cough impulse. Acute abdominal pain, tenderness of the hernia, and an absent cough impulse can occur in an obstructed or strangulated hernia but in these cases, the patient would have features of bowel obstruction (e.g., absent bowel sounds).",

Furthermore, atrial fibrillation, which this patient has, is an important risk factor for AMI. However, a palpable mass is not an expected finding in this condition. Abdominal examination is typically unremarkable in the early stages of AMI but as bowel infarction develops, patients develop peritoneal signs (e.g., rigidity, guarding in all quadrants, decreased bowel sounds).",

Diverticulosis, which predisposes to acute diverticulitis, is also common among elderly individuals. However, a palpable mass caused by either pericolic inflammation or a diverticular abscess is intraabdominal and would, therefore, become less prominent with maneuvers that tense the abdominal musculature.",

However, acute pancreatitis typically causes tenderness in the epigastric region rather than the left lower quadrant. Although pancreatic abscesses or pseudocysts are complications of acute pancreatitis that can manifest as a palpable abdominal mass, these occur days to weeks after an episode of acute pancreatitis and are located in the epigastrium. Moreover, both pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts are intraabdominal masses and would, therefore, become less prominent with maneuvers that tense the abdominal musculature.",

The sharp pain woke him up and he now is also complaining of numbness in the fingers and difficulty moving his arm. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include atorvastatin, aspirin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and clopidogrel. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. His left arm is cool to touch and pale, and the left radial pulse is not palpable. Muscle strength is 1/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in all other extremities.

However, papillary muscle rupture often leads to severe mitral regurgitation, which manifests with dyspnea, cough, bilateral crackles, and hypotension, none of which this patient has. Furthermore, papillary muscle rupture is less likely in a patient with a single-vessel anterior wall MI, because the anterolateral papillary muscle has a dual blood supply from the left circumflex and left anterior descending arteries.",

A left ventricular pseudoaneurysm typically develops 3–14 days after myocardial infarction, and it can also lead to decreased cardiac output and arrhythmia. Initial diagnosis of a ventricular pseudoaneurysm is performed with transthoracic echocardiography, but a definitive diagnosis is determined with angiography, which allows direct visualization of the lesion.\n\nMural thromboembolism can also be associated with a true ventricular aneurysm. As true ventricular aneurysm typically develops 2 weeks to a few months postinfarction, this patient is more likely to have a ventricular pseudoaneurysm (see “Overview of MI complications” table).",

        "explanation_why": "Duplex ultrasonography should be performed in patients with ST who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), such as pregnancy, chronic venous insufficiency, and obesity. While ST is typically a clinical diagnosis, duplex ultrasonography can be used to assess for concomitant DVT and evaluate the extent and location of ST, which help determine the need for anticoagulation. Most cases of ST are self-limited and management is symptomatic, usually consisting of NSAIDs (however, NSAIDs should be avoided during pregnancy), elevation of the affected limb, and compression therapy. Anticoagulation is recommended for patients with a large segment (≥ 5 cm) ST or a thrombus near the deep venous system, and/or if risk factors for DVT are present. Low molecular weight heparin is preferred in pregnant patients.",

Moreover, in PAN, the skin lesions and extremity pain develop more insidiously, in contrast to the acute presentation seen here. Also, malaise, weight loss, myalgia, arthralgia, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, melena) would be expected.

His wife reports that he also had these symptoms on his chest 1 month ago; both episodes resolved spontaneously. He has had diarrhea and a decreased appetite resulting in a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss during the past 3 months. He also has hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a chronic dry cough. Current medications are enalapril and omeprazole. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years but quit 10 years ago. He drinks a glass of wine daily. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows an erythematous, cord-like lesion that is tender to palpation on the radial aspect of his right forearm. Auscultation of the lungs discloses mild expiratory wheezing; there are no crackles or rhonchi. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's clinical findings?",

The previously recommended age to start screening was 50 years. Colonoscopy every 10 years is an appropriate strategy. Because this patient had his last colonoscopy 8 years ago, which was normal, and lacks symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (e.g., weight loss, hematochezia), a colonoscopy is not indicated at this time.",

Screening may be considered in patients with genetic conditions associated with a higher incidence of intracranial aneurysms (e.g., autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and in patients with first-degree relatives with a history of intracranial aneurysms, neither of which is seen here.",

    "question_text": "A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a painful nonhealing lesion that developed on his left toes 2 weeks ago after he accidentally hit them at work. He also has a 4-month history of pain in his calves when walking, which initially subsided after rest but now persists regardless of activity. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic retinopathy. His medications include insulin, ramipril, and metoprolol. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily and drinks 2–3 beers daily. Temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 89/min, blood pressure is 146/90 mm Hg, and BMI is 29 kg/m^2. Physical examination shows well-demarcated areas of necrosis on the left distal third and fourth toes with surrounding erythema. Popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses are not palpable on the left side and are decreased on the right. His hemoglobin A_1c is 8.2%, leukocyte count is 7500/mm^3, and serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. MR angiography shows a normal left femoral artery. There is extensive occlusion of the proximal left popliteal artery and segmental stenosis of the left tibial arteries and the fibular artery. The distal left anterior tibial artery above the ankle is patent, and there are multiple collaterals. Antibiotic treatment is initiated. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",

He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily and drinks 2–3 beers daily. Temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 89/min, blood pressure is 146/90 mm Hg, and BMI is 29 kg/m2. Physical examination shows well-demarcated areas of necrosis on the left distal third and fourth toes with surrounding erythema. Popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses are not palpable on the left side and are decreased on the right. His hemoglobin A1c is 8.2%, leukocyte count is 7500/mm3, and serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. MR angiography shows a normal left femoral artery. There is extensive occlusion of the proximal left popliteal artery and segmental stenosis of the left tibial arteries and the fibular artery. The distal left anterior tibial artery above the ankle is patent, and there are multiple collaterals. Antibiotic treatment is initiated. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",

Prior to the angiography, he received a heparin bolus. He has hypertension and steatohepatitis. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years and drinks one to two beers weekly. His medications include simvastatin, aspirin, and atenolol. Temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Skin examination shows a tender, reticulated blue-red discoloration of the left calf without swelling and several nonblanching reddish maculae on the lateral foot and the toes. Pedal pulses are 1+ bilaterally. Sensation to touch and temperature is normal over the lower extremities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's rash?",

The embolization of microscopic cholesterol crystals into small arterioles affects many organs, and affected individuals can present with skin changes (e.g., livedo reticularis, blue toe syndrome), gastrointestinal ischemia, pancreatitis, CNS symptoms (transient ischemic attack, stroke), or acute kidney injury.",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "In a patient with a history of episodic postprandial pain (suggestive of chronic mesenteric ischemia), the hyperacute onset of severe midabdominal pain out of proportion to examination findings indicates acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). Considering her risk factors for atherosclerosis, AMI is most likely due to arterial thrombosis. Metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and increased activity of certain enzymes (e.g., amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase) are nonspecific findings often associated with AMI.",

        "explanation_why": "Upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) can be used to diagnose structural or functional abnormalities of the esophagus (e.g., achalasia), stomach (e.g., gastric outlet obstruction), or proximal small intestine (e.g., duodenal atresia), all of which can manifest with acute abdominal pain. However, UGI is contraindicated in suspected AMI because the introduction of barium and air into the small bowel can increase intraluminal pressure and worsen ischemia. Furthermore, barium in the gastrointestinal tract interferes with subsequent imaging studies and can cause peritonitis in patients with bowel perforation.",

        "explanation_why": "Ultrasound can be used to diagnose some conditions that manifest with acute abdominal pain, such as gallstone disease, appendicitis in certain groups (e.g., children), and certain structural abnormalities (e.g., intussusception). In the context of suspected AMI, color duplex ultrasound is able to detect proximal arterial occlusions and might show signs of perforation (e.g., distended intestinal loops, free fluid in the abdominal cavity). However, color duplex ultrasound is poor at detecting distal arterial occlusions, and picture quality is often limited because of overlying bowel gas, abdominal fat, and vascular calcifications. A different test is more appropriate for confirming a diagnosis of AMI.",

This procedure permits direct evaluation of the abdominal viscera (e.g., for the extent of ischemia, perforation, bleeding) and allows simultaneous surgical therapy (e.g., bowel resection, surgical revascularization). However, this patient is hemodynamically stable and shows no signs of peritonitis, so a different, less invasive test is more appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "High-resolution CT angiography (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis is the diagnostic test of choice for suspected AMI in hemodynamically stable patients without signs of peritonitis (e.g., diffuse abdominal guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness) because it is fast, noninvasive, and accurate in detecting disrupted blood flow and vascular stenosis. This test can differentiate embolic from thrombotic arterial occlusion and provides further information about the vasculature and surrounding structures, all of which are necessary for the planning of subsequent therapy. Furthermore, CTA images can be used to exclude most differentials of acute abdominal pain (e.g., pancreatitis, appendicitis, nephrolithiasis).",

However, a less invasive test is now available, so catheter angiography is only recommended for diagnosis of AMI if that test is inconclusive.",

A shared decision to perform right-sided carotid endarterectomy was made with consent from the patient's medical power of attorney, and the management plan was documented in the patient records as “CEA right.” The surgical intern meets the patient on the ward on the day of surgery and, using a permanent marker, circles the surgical site and marks “X” on the nonsurgical site. The patient is brought to the operating room and the circulating nurse confirms that all relevant patient documents and findings are available. While the surgical team is scrubbing, the anesthetist asks the patient to verify her surgery site by pointing to it. Regional anesthesia is performed, and the patient is draped. The surgery is subsequently performed without any complications.

    "hint": "The Universal Protocol should be followed to prevent never events such as wrong-site surgery. This protocol consists of a series of steps based on the human factors engineering strategy of redundancy and standardization and should be performed before invasive medical procedures. In this scenario, the surgeon did not follow the protocol for one of these steps correctly and a subsequent step was missed entirely. If this subsequent step had been performed, it could have reduced the likelihood of the error occurring by acting as an additional safety measure (i.e., a Swiss cheese model).",

        "explanation_why": "The Universal Protocol is a three-step process:\n\n1. preprocedural verification of the patient's identity, the surgical site, and the surgical procedure;\n2. surgical site marking;\n3. performing a time-out.\n\nA surgical time-out is performed in the operating room prior to the procedure to reconfirm the patient's identity, the procedure, and the surgical site. The time-out is typically initiated by a designated member of the team, such as the circulating nurse, and involves all of the team members (e.g., operating room technicians, principal surgeon, medical students) who are participating in the procedure. The whole team is responsible for reviewing all of the relevant information through active communication, and once everyone is in agreement, the time-out should be documented. A successful time-out requires a safety culture, which provides an environment in which health care providers can actively speak up about potential errors.\n\nThe protocol for surgical site marking was also not followed correctly in this scenario. When marking the surgical site, the correct site should be marked by writing the word “YES”, the surgeon's initials, or both using an indelible marker. The incorrect surgical site should not be marked; this includes marking with the word “NO” or an ambiguous visual cue (e.g., an “X” could also be interpreted as an indicator of the correct site).",

Radial pulses are palpable. Her surgical incisions appear well-healed. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

However, this patient does not have other common features of TOS, such as symptoms of brachial plexus compression (e.g., paresthesias, weakness). Isolated compression of the subclavian vein without compression of parts of the brachial plexus is rare. Moreover, TOS is typically caused by repetitive arm lifting, trauma, or surrounding structural abnormalities (e.g., anomalous cervical rib, Pancoast tumors), none of which has been reported by this patient.",

DVT is more common in patients with risk factors that enhance the pathophysiological mechanisms of the Virchow triad: hypercoagulability (e.g., active cancer, thrombophilias), endothelial injury (e.g., intravascular devices), and venous stasis (e.g., immobilization). The diagnostic approach to DVT should be based on pretest probability (PTP), which can be determined using the Wells criteria for DVT. Individuals with low PTP should be screened with D-dimer to rule out DVT while individuals with a high PTP or a positive D-dimer should receive a venous compression ultrasound. Primary treatment consists of oral anticoagulation therapy.",

He reports that his left big toe has looked “weird” for several weeks but was not painful until now. He has not seen a physician in the past 15 years. Family history is remarkable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years and drinks two 12-oz beers daily. He takes no medications. He appears distressed. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 112 kg (246 lb); BMI is 35 kg/m^2. Temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 118/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 94/50 mm Hg. Examination of the left foot shows erythema and edema up to the level of the midfoot. The left first toe appears moist and enlarged, with grayish-black discoloration and blistering. The right foot shows dry, shiny, bluish skin with brittle nails. Dorsalis pedis pulses are not palpable and posterior tibial pulses are weak bilaterally. Sensation to pinprick is decreased in both feet up to the level of the ankle. Leukocyte count is 17,000/mm^3. In addition to intravenous fluids and antibiotics, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In patients < 40 years of age, the underlying cause of the infarction is most commonly a hypercoagulable state, whereas the etiology in patients > 40 years of age is most often thromboembolic. Thrombophilia testing, including serology for antiphospholipid antibodies, should be performed to identify the underlying cause of nontraumatic splenic infarction. This woman's history of miscarriages and her prolonged partial thromboplastin time suggest antiphospholipid syndrome. The use of oral contraceptives further increases the risk of developing thrombi. If the patient has an underlying hypercoagulable state, anticoagulant therapy is required in addition to hydration, analgesics, and close monitoring. Symptoms typically resolve within 1–2 weeks in uncomplicated cases. Follow-up imaging is required to screen for complications (e.g., hemorrhage, pseudocyst, abscess). If complications develop or symptoms persist, splenectomy may be required.",

Capsular enhancement is preserved.The finding represents a splenic infarction. Infarctions may be single or multiple and typically appear as hypoenhancing or nonenhancing lesions, often wedge-shaped. Imaging features can vary with stage. Acute infarctions may appear heterogeneous and contain sites of hemorrhage. Chronic infarctions may disappear or liquify and become cystic. They may also result in parenchymal scarring, seen as splenic volume loss and distortion.A: aorta; C: colon; L: liver; red overlay: splenic artery",

This patient has splenomegaly, but the acute onset of symptoms and the lack of cytopenia are not consistent with hypersplenism. Moreover, she has no medical history of conditions associated with increased splenic activity (e.g., liver disease, malaria, leukemia).",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient's presentation should raise concern for aortic dissection, most likely involving the aortic arch and descending aorta. Syncope, a history of sharp back pain migrating to the abdomen, and evidence of perfusion deficit in the lower extremities (bilaterally decreased femoral pulses, leg paresthesia) are consistent with an aortic dissection that extends downward with successive occlusion of branching vessels (e.g., carotid arteries, abdominal arteries, femoral arteries).",

However, before proceeding to surgery, the diagnosis must be established and imaging is required.",

        "explanation_why": "Beta blockers (e.g., labetalol) may be used for hypertensive and/or tachycardic patients with confirmed aortic dissection if they are managed conservatively. Although these drugs can be administrated simultaneously while establishing the diagnosis in the case of a hypertensive emergency, this patient is hemodynamically stable and requires a definitive diagnosis first. Administering beta blockers prematurely before differential diagnoses have been ruled out may be harmful; e.g., it could lead to severe hypotension in a patient with a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Administration of beta blockers would also not be recommended if the patient required emergency surgery. A different step in management is indicated first.",

However, this woman is hemodynamically stable and a different imaging modality can rule out or confirm aortic dissection (and other differentials) with even greater sensitivity and specificity; it also can assess the extension of dissections below the diaphragm, which TEE cannot.",

Further, nonspecific findings of aortic dissection in this patient include an elevated D-dimer level due to clot formation in the lumen and pleural effusion on chest x-ray. In this woman, CTA can also be used to rule out pulmonary embolism (which can lead to nonspecific symptoms and a high D-dimer level) and acute aortic occlusion (which can cause leg paresthesia and decreased femoral pulse).\n\nFor hemodynamically unstable patients or patients with contraindications to contrast agents (e.g., renal insufficiency), transesophageal echocardiography should be performed instead of CTA.",

The right and left coronary, the innominate, the left common carotid, and the subclavian arteries originate from the true lumen (green overlay; false lumen is red overlay). Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta.

        "explanation_why": "This patient's CT scan shows evidence of a large pulmonary embolism (PE). In cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability (e.g., SBP < 90 mm Hg), thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) such as alteplase is indicated. Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment. Anticoagulation with heparin, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or apixaban is also appropriate treatment for patients with PE. However, these agents are typically used in patients who remain hemodynamically stable.",

The aortic arch and descending aorta are not affected. The right and left coronary, the innominate, the left common carotid, and the subclavian arteries originate from the true lumen (green overlay; false lumen is red overlay). Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta. Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen.Additional findings include sternotomy wires, a prosthetic aortic valve, atherosclerotic calcifications, pancreatic calcifications, and a small hiatal hernia.LCA: left coronary artery; RCA: right coronary artery; yellow overlay: azygos vein",
