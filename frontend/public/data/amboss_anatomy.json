Impaired ciliary function reduces mucociliary clearance, resulting in bronchiectasis (due to recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, which are responsible for this patient's crackles and wheezing on examination) and chronic sinusitis. It also renders sperm immotile, which reduces fertility, and can cause dextrocardia (because cilia are responsible for the position of internal organs during embryological development). Other clinical features of PCD include chronic otitis media and conductive hearing loss. Kartagener syndrome is a subtype of PCD characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.\n\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia can also be caused by defects in ciliary assembly proteins or radial spokes.",

        "explanation_why": "Voice pitch limitation is caused by damage to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN), which occurs in up to 30% of thyroid dissections. The external branch of the SLN innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for lengthening, thinning, and stiffening the vocal cords and increases the pitch of phonation. The cricothyroid muscle is the only tensor of the vocal cord, and its denervation results in an inability to increase the pitch of the voice or produce explosive sounds as well as easy voice fatigability.",

            "description": "The thyroid gland is located in front of the trachea in the lower neck and consists of two lobes connected by an isthmus. A third pyramidal lobe extending from the isthmus is present in 50% of patients. This third lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct.The parathyroid glands are located posterior to the thyroid gland; they may vary in number and location. The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) branch off from the vagus nerve; the left RLN loops under the aortic arch, and the right RLN passes beneath the subclavian artery. Both RLNs are vulnerable to injury during thyroid surgery as they ascend to the larynx behind the thyroid gland. Unilateral RLN injury may result in hoarseness, and bilateral RLN injury may cause dyspnea and stridor.",

Hypoparathyroidism is the most frequent complication of total or near-total thyroidectomy. However, the superior parathyroid glands are most commonly found inferior to the superior thyroid artery and the external branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and are thus less likely to be injured in this patient.",

This causes the affected vocal fold to rest in the paramedian or lateralized position. Coughing, which requires transient tight glottic closure, may then become ineffective. While unilateral RLN injury can occur during thyroid surgery, the nerve is unlikely to be damaged during ligation of the superior thyroid artery. Instead, the RLN is at risk during preparation of the inferior pole of the thyroid gland, as it runs close to the inferior thyroid artery.",

However, cavernous sinus thrombosis has additional symptoms that are not present in this case, such as headache, photophobia, proptosis, and other cranial nerve palsies (commonly CN VI).

Rather than mydriasis, this patient has miosis. Furthermore, if such an aneurysm were symptomatic, it would manifest with headache rather than the shoulder and arm pain seen here.",

Additional injury to the deeper somatic fibers of the nerve (which control extraocular muscles) is responsible for this patient's ptosis and “down and out” gaze.\n\nAcute CN III palsy due to a cerebral aneurysm is very concerning for imminent rupture.

Paralysis of the inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles results in downward deviation (hypotropia) and outward deviation (exotropia) of the affected eye (down-and-out gaze) due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle results in ptosis and impairment of parasympathetic function in mydriasis (as well as loss of accommodation and pupillary light reflex, which are not shown). Patients present with horizontal or horizontal and vertical double vision (diplopia) that worsens when turning the gaze away from the affected side.

However, this patient does not have nystagmus and the diplopia in INO is only present when the patient's gaze moves towards the contralateral side of the lesion, in contrast to this patient's resting diplopia.

In ACS, proprioception and vibration sense are preserved because the posterior spinal arteries provide blood supply to the dorsal columns. The thoracolumbar segment of the spinal cord is a watershed area and is, therefore, the most common site of infarction, as seen here.\n\nACS may occur as a complication of an aortic aneurysm itself or iatrogenically during the repair of the aneurysm (due to damage to the anterior spinal artery and/or artery of Adamkiewicz). Other causes of ACS include trauma (e.g., penetrating injury), hypotension (e.g., from severe hemorrhage), and compression (e.g., tumors, cervical spondylosis).",

This channel is formed when the processus vaginalis fails to obliterate in utero, allowing for communication with the peritoneal cavity (e.g., accumulation of peritoneal fluid, protrusion of intestinal organs, etc.). A communicating hydrocele may increase in size with crying or the Valsalva maneuver (i.e., on increases in intra-abdominal pressure) but is often reducible, as seen in this patient. As such, all hydroceles must be distinguished from inguinal hernias (a palpable mass as opposed to a fluctuant mass).\n\nCongenital hydroceles usually resolve spontaneously, but surgery may be indicated in prolonged forms to prevent an inguinal hernia.",

        "explanation_why": "Anorectal varices occur in patients with portal hypertension as a result of increased blood flow in the portosystemic anastomoses that connect the superior rectal vein with the inferior and middle rectal veins. The superior rectal vein receives blood from the region of the anal canal above the dentate line and drains into the inferior mesenteric vein (portal venous circulation). The superior rectal vein would be the source of bleeding in the case of lesions located above the dentate line, such as the anorectal varices seen in this patient. The inferior rectal veins, which receive blood from the region below the dentate line and drain into the internal pudendal veins (systemic venous circulation), would be the source of bleeding in the case of lesions located below the dentate line, such as external hemorrhoids.",

Her 18-year-old sister has a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has been in remission for 11 years. The patient's temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination shows a 3 × 2 cm swelling on the left side, 4 cm below the base of the mandible and anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The swelling is soft and fluctuant. It does not move with swallowing, and forced exhalation against a closed glottis does not increase the size of the swelling. Ultrasound shows a round mass with uniform low echogenicity and no internal septations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The FDP, along with the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), is responsible for finger flexion. The tendons from the FDP muscle run through the carpal tunnel and insert on the palmar side of the distal phalanges of each finger, whereas the FDS tendons insert on the middle phalanx. This patient's inability to flex the DIP combined with the pain over the DIP joint, which is distal to the attachment of the FDS, indicate that he has ruptured his FDP tendon.",

However, pain would usually be localized and not radiate along a dermatome of a nerve root.

However, this patient does not have any significant risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., older, chronic glucocorticoid use, postmenopausal female) or TB (e.g., immunosuppression, drug/alcohol abuse, congregate settings), nor does he have a history of significant trauma (e.g., fall from height), making vertebral fracture and Pott's disease unlikely.",

Compression, tension, and shear and torque stresses on the spinal disk (as with heavy lifting) together with degenerative changes (e.g., dehydration) can lead to a tear in the annulus fibrosus, resulting in nucleus pulposus herniation into the vertebral canal with subsequent spinal cord and/or nerve root compression.

To open her eyes, the patient must contract the frontalis muscle, resulting in the forehead wrinkles seen in image B. Both eyes deviate outwards (exotropia) and downwards (hypotropia) from the primary gaze position. This occurs due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, which are the only unaffected extraocular muscles. Mydriasis indicates involvement of the parasympathetic portion of the oculomotor nerve.Ptosis, mydriasis, exotropia, and hypotropia are the classic signs of complete oculomotor palsy. Complete oculomotor palsy is more commonly unilateral than bilateral.",

Weakness of this fascia results in a loss of support of the urethra and/or bladder, leading to cystocele and/or urethrocele. Patients typically present with urinary symptoms such as urgency, hesitation, incomplete emptying, and urinary incontinence, none of which is seen here. In addition, fecal urgency and a feeling of incomplete evacuation would not be expected. Moreover, anterior rather than posterior bulging of the vaginal wall would be expected during Valsalva maneuver.",

Acquired weakness of the rectovaginal fascia, e.g., due to multiple vaginal deliveries or low estrogen levels during menopause, can cause herniation of the posterior vaginal wall, which is associated with protrusion of the rectum into the vaginal canal (i.e. rectocele), which can become visible during Valsalva maneuver. Typical symptoms of rectocele include increased fecal urgency and a sensation of incomplete evacuation following defecation. Patients with large rectoceles may report needing to insert their fingers into the vagina to press against the rectovaginal fascia, thereby facilitating the emptying of stool.\n\nFirst-line therapy consists of conservative strategies, such as Kegel exercises, weight loss, a high-fiber diet, and vaginal pessaries.",

    "hint": "Dissociated sensory loss (dysesthetic pain and absent temperature sensation with normal fine touch sensation) occurs as a result of the anterior white commissure compression. This finding in a cape-like distribution (upper extremities and upper chest) indicates a central cord syndrome of the cervicothoracic spinal cord (most likely at the level of the C5–T1 spinal nerves).

Since the syrinx is most likely located at the level of the C5–T1 spinal nerves and the anterior horn cells that form the efferent arc of the biceps reflex are located at the level of the C5 and C6 spinal nerves, the patient is at risk of developing a decreased or absent rather than exaggerated biceps reflex. Features of upper motor neuron injury (e.g., hyperreflexia) can occur below the level of the syrinx due to damage to the upper motor neurons in the medial part of the lateral corticospinal tracts.",

The absence of sacral sparing is characteristic of complete spinal cord injury. Patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries such as central cord syndrome typically have sacral sparing (i.e., an unaffected anal wink reflex or bulbocutaneous reflex) because the corticospinal fibers that innervate the anterior horn cells of the sacral segments are located in the lateral-most part of the corticospinal tract.",

Damage to these neurons results in central Horner syndrome, which manifests with ptosis, i.e., drooping of the eyelid (because the superior tarsal muscle is sympathetically innervated), miosis, and anhidrosis.\n\nAs the syrinx expands, the patient will develop features of LMN injury at the syrinx's level (due to damage to the anterior horn cells) and features of UMN injury below the level of the syrinx (due to damage to the medial parts of the lateral corticospinal tract).",

        "explanation_why": "Failure of the ductus arteriosus to completely close postnatally allows blood to flow from the descending aorta back to the pulmonary artery (left-to-right shunt). In a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), this leads to volume overload of the right ventricle and the lung circuit. This increased blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension and irreversible remodeling of small pulmonary vessels, which may eventually lead to an Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). This patient's palpable right parasternal heave and pronounced S_2 are evidence of increased right heart strain. In patients with a large PDA, the features of differential cyanosis occur once shunt reversal develops. Because the ductus is located on the descending aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, reversal of the shunt results in deoxygenated blood reaching only the lower body. Due to the rise in pulmonary pressure, the characteristic continuous machine-like murmur heard in patients with PDA eventually disappears.\n\nInfants with PDA usually receive an infusion of indomethacin to induce closure of the duct, while in older children symptomatic PDAs are typically closed surgically or via percutaneous catheter occlusion. The presence of an Eisenmenger reaction is, however, a contraindication to a PDA closure.",

The symptoms of a mild CoA can begin later in life but in such a scenario, differential cyanosis would not be expected. Instead, patients present with features of brachiocephalic hypertension (e.g., headaches, epistaxis), lower extremity arterial insufficiency (manifesting with claudication and cool skin with faint or unpalpable pulses, but no cyanosis), and evidence of compensatory collateral arteries (e.g., continuous murmur over the back).",

Additionally, patients may present with constitutional findings (e.g., weight loss, fever, or anemia). The typical auscultatory finding (also present in this patient) is an early diastolic “plop,” caused by a movement of the mobile tumor mass, followed by a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apex that results from the obstructed blood flow through the mitral valve, and mimics the murmur of mitral stenosis.",

However, among the alpha-1 blockers, tamsulosin is the agent with the lowest potential of inducing hypotension because of its increased selectivity for alpha-1 receptors of the bladder neck and the prostatic urethra.

Right heart failure is a condition that can cause systemic hypoperfusion. For this reason dilatation (not constriction) of the renal afferent arteriole would rather be expected in this patient.",

Paralysis of the inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles results in downward deviation (hypotropia) and outward deviation (exotropia) of the affected eye (down-and-out gaze) due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle results in ptosis and impairment of parasympathetic function in mydriasis (as well as loss of accommodation and pupillary light reflex, which are not shown). Patients present with horizontal or horizontal and vertical double vision (diplopia) that worsens when turning the gaze away from the affected side. The ptosis, however, may prevent patients from experiencing diplopia.",

Nonseminoma tumors include embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumors, testicular choriocarcinomas, teratomas, and tumors with mixed germ cell histology. Pure teratomas typically do not cause an elevation in testicular tumor markers (beta-hCG, AFP, PLAP), which is consistent with this patient's laboratory studies. Teratomas are more common in children but are usually benign in this patient group. In adult males, they are rare but more often malignant.\n\nUnlike hydroceles, testicular tumors do not transilluminate on examination. Typically, testicular tumors should not be percutaneously biopsied because a biopsy can cause seeding of malignant cells in the scrotum.",

    "hint": "This male newborn has epispadias, a condition that manifests with a urethral opening on the dorsal aspect of the penis. Epispadias is often associated with bladder exstrophy, which causes herniation of bladder mucosa through the lower midline abdominal wall, as seen in this patient.",

Severe oligohydramnios results in Potter sequence, which consists of craniofacial abnormalities, clubbed feet, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Posterior urethral valves can cause bladder dysfunction but are not associated with epispadias or bladder exstrophy.",

The cyst can develop anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct and manifests as a painless, firm, midline mass of the anterior neck. Like the thyroid gland, the thyroglossal cyst is enclosed within the pretracheal fascia, which is responsible for the upward movement of these structures during swallowing. In addition, a thyroglossal cyst moves upward with tongue protrusion because the fibrous remnants of the thyroglossal duct are connected to the base of the tongue.",

            "description": "Baroreceptors are stretch receptors that are located in the carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch of the aorta. Baroreceptors sense minute blood pressure (BP) changes and send afferent signals to the brain stem (nucleus tractus solitarius) via the vagus nerve from the aortic arch and the glossopharyngeal nerve from the carotid sinus. The brainstem modulates autonomic outflow to alter the heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance to normalize BP (i.e., ↓ BP → sympathetic stimulation → ↑ HR, ↑ peripheral vascular resistance → ↑ BP; ↑ BP → parasympathetic stimulation → ↓ HR and ↓ peripheral vascular resistance → ↓BP). This pathway is known as the baroreflex.A prolonged decrease in BP also stimulates long-term homeostatic mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway (RAAS) and ADH secretion (↑ ADH release → ↓ water excretion by the kidneys → ↑ intravascular volume → ↑ BP).Chemoreceptors detect minute changes in pH and partial pressures of respiratory gases. Peripheral chemoreceptors, located in the carotid body and aortic body, are stimulated by a fall in pH and pO_2 or a rise in pCO_2, which occurs in hypoxia. Chemoreceptors send afferent signals to the brain stem (dorsal respiratory group) via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, which stimulates the respiratory centers of the brain, resulting in an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. Chemoreceptor stimulation also increases the sympathetic outflow to the heart.",

        "explanation_why": "Since this patient has no signs of ongoing inflammation, no history of recent testicular trauma, and a normal testis on palpation, he most likely has a primary/idiopathic hydrocele, which is caused by an imbalance in the rate of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis. Primary hydroceles differ from secondary/reactive hydroceles in that the underlying cause of fluid accumulation within the tunica vaginalis is not known (idiopathic). In secondary/reactive hydroceles, inflammation (e.g., epididymitis, orchitis), trauma, or neoplasia causes an imbalance in fluid secretion and absorption by the tunica vaginalis.",

Although a child with a communicating hydrocele will have the same clinical findings as this patient, the onset of this patient's symptoms in the 6^th decade of life makes this diagnosis unlikely. Moreover, in contrast to this case, a communicating hydrocele would increase in size on coughing/straining due to its communication with the peritoneal cavity.\n\nA patent processus vaginalis is also the cause of indirect inguinal hernia, which can be congenital or acquired and also present as a nontender scrotal mass that may vary in size and, if the content is omentum, absent bowel sounds within the mass. However, since an inguinal hernia enters the scrotum through the superficial inguinal ring with solid content, the examiner will not be able to palpate normal tissue above the mass and the transillumination test will be negative. It would also increase in coughing/straining (unless it is an obstructed/strangulated hernia).",

The ovarian vessels travel through this ligament to supply the ovaries and the upper part of the uterus. To achieve rapid hemostasis, the ligament containing the uterine arteries (main blood supply to the uterus) should first be ligated.

During hysterectomy, the ureters are at increased risk for injury due to their proximity to the cardinal ligament.\n\nUterine atony (as evidenced by the soft, boggy uterus in this patient) is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage and occurs when the myometrial fibers of the uterus fail to fully contract and compress the uteroplacental vasculature (branches of the uterine artery) after placental delivery.

The broad ligament can be divided into the mesosalpinx, the mesovarium, and the mesometrium.\n- The ovaries are suspended from the uterus by the ovarian ligament and from the lateral pelvic wall by the suspensory (infundibulopelvic) ligament of the ovary.\n- The cardinal ligament encloses the uterine artery and vein and connects the cervix with the lateral pelvic wall.\n- The uterosacral ligament connects the cervix to the sacrum.",

The S1 nerve root controls plantar flexion through the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, so weakness in these muscles can lead to a diminished Achilles tendon reflex and impaired toe walking. Additionally, the S1 nerve root controls sensation in the dorsolateral aspect of the thigh, the posterior calf, and the lateral side of the foot, which explains this patient's radiating pain in these regions.",

Neonates with HLHS also have weak peripheral pulses, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis as the hypoplastic left ventricle cannot maintain adequate cardiac output.

Exertion, such as crying or feeding, increases the RVOO. This results in cyanosis (tet spells) due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD instead of the pulmonary valve, which in turn causes the murmur to become softer. The right ventricle hypertrophies because it chronically pumps against high resistance caused by the RVOO.\n\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during a tet spell. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases left ventricular pressure and decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the VSD. Infants who are having a tet spell should be placed with their knees toward their chest to achieve the same effect.",

        "explanation_why": "Common causes of oligohydramnios include chronic placental insufficiency, chronic amniotic fluid leakage, and decreased fetal renal output. Prenatal posterior urethral valves lead to a bladder outlet obstruction and a decrease in fetal renal output. Other causes of decreased fetal renal output include bilateral renal agenesis and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.\n\nThe decreased amount of amniotic fluid may result in the development of deformities in the face (Potter facies) and limbs. Oligohydramnios can also affect fetal lung development, resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia. This infant's cyanosis and respiratory distress are likely due to pulmonary hypoplasia, which is also the most common cause of death in Potter sequence.",

Tendon avulsion, or rupture of the pectoralis major, can occur in bodybuilders as a result of excessive muscle loading and is accompanied by a sharp, tearing sensation, weakness, swelling, and ecchymosis. This patient has pain during external rotation of the shoulder, which suggests the injury of a different tendon.",

Through eccentric contraction, this type of activity especially strains the posterior rotator cuff when slowing down after releasing the ball. Tendon overload can cause microscopic tears called microinjuries. The relatively avascular nature of tendons means that these microinjuries have limited healing potential and can propagate into partial or full-thickness tears, or tendinopathy. The infraspinatus muscle, along with the teres minor muscle, is responsible for the external rotation of the humerus. This patient's shoulder pain during external rotation suggests infraspinatus tendinopathy.",

Although the ureters are in close proximity to the lateral walls of the uterus in a non-gravid state, they are pushed laterally as the uterus enlarges during pregnancy. This makes them less susceptible to injury during a cesarean section.",

        "explanation_why": "The lower third of the ureter (pelvic ureter) lies just below the cardinal ligament, which contains the uterine artery. Because the uterine arteries are ligated during a hysterectomy, the ureters are at risk of being injured. The ureters are also susceptible to injury during ovarian surgeries (e.g., oophorectomy) as they lie below the infundibulopelvic ligament, which contains the ovarian arteries. Although any abdominopelvic surgery is a risk factor for ureteric injuries, hysterectomies are the most frequent cause.",

The contents of an inguinal hernia usually consist of intraperitoneal structures, most commonly omentum or bowel. In large hernias, the bladder may also be involved.

This patient has sustained a fracture of the posterior aspect of the left 12^th rib as is evident from the tenderness over his back and the x-ray findings, which makes a kidney laceration the most likely associated injury.\n\nLeft lower rib fractures also commonly cause splenic injury (including splenic rupture) due to the proximity of the posterior surface of the spleen to the left 9^th, 10^th, and 11^th ribs.

This injury most commonly occurs in children < 5 years of age due to sudden tugging of the outstretched and pronated arm (e.g., pulling of a child's arm to keep them from falling). Clinical features include painful and limited movement of the upper extremity without swelling; the injured individual typically holds their forearm in a flexed and pronated position. The diagnosis is made clinically based on characteristic history and clinical features; radiologic confirmation is usually not required.\n\nManagement is conservative and involves closed, manual reduction of the radial head; the radial head can be relocated by hyperpronation of the forearm or supination of the forearm with the elbow in flexion.",

The patient here is unstable with hypotension and tachycardia, so the pneumothorax should be decompressed as quickly as possible. Since the neurovascular bundle runs below each rib, the upper edge of the rib is the preferred puncture site to help mitigate the risk of excessive bleeding and nerve damage. Emergency needle thoracostomy should be followed by chest tube placement in the 5^th intercostal space along the midaxillary line.\n\nAccording to the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, the 2^nd left intercostal space along the midclavicular line is no longer the preferred needle insertion site for emergency decompression of a tension pneumothorax in adults. This location is associated with high failure rates because of increased anterior chest wall thickness. Instead, placing the needle in the 5^th left intercostal space along the midaxillary line is preferable.",

The patient is asked to resist the downward pressure (green arrow). The supraspinatus muscle, in particular, is required to maintain the arm's position. If there is pain or if the patient is unable to maintain this position against resistance exerted by the examiner, this indicates a functional disorder of the supraspinatus muscle (e.g., rupture, tendinopathy, or subacromial bursitis). If an impairment is present, Jobe's test is considered positive.",

Failure of this conduit to obliterate after testicular descent into the scrotum causes outpouching of the parietal peritoneum (and bowel) through the deep inguinal ring, the inguinal canal, and the superficial inguinal ring, leading to an indirect inguinal hernia. These hernias are located outside the Hesselbach triangle, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, and can manifest with a communicating hydrocele, as seen in this patient.",

The thenar muscles (opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis) are innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve; compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel can therefore cause thenar atrophy. Branches of the median nerve also provide sensory innervation to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral (radial) half of the ring finger, which is why CTS causes pain and paresthesias in this distribution.\n\nOther conditions associated with CTS include hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and acromegaly.",

A thyroglossal duct cyst can arise anywhere along this tract and may become enlarged or inflamed after a URI, like with this patient. However, inflammation would be expected at the anterior neck (i.e., midline mass), rather than the tongue. Furthermore, a technetium-99m scan in a patient with a thyroglossal duct cyst would show uptake at the normally positioned thyroid gland, which is not the case here.",

Compression of the duodenum by this artery is called superior mesenteric artery syndrome. The classic presentation includes postprandial pain and bilious emesis following extreme weight loss.\n\nRapid weight loss causes shrinkage of the fat pad between the superior mesenteric artery and the duodenum, leading to compression of the intestinal lumen. Pediatric patients with congenitally abnormal arterial anatomy or those undergoing corrective surgery for scoliosis are also at risk.",

        "explanation_why": "The infundibulopelvic ligament (suspensory ligament of the ovary) is a fold of peritoneum that connects the ovaries to the lateral walls of the pelvis. It carries the ovarian artery, vein, nerves, and lymphatics, and is affected during ovarian torsion, which requires surgical management. If the ovary is deemed nonviable, the infundibulopelvic ligament is ligated during oophorectomy. During this procedure, care must be taken not to damage the ureter, which is located directly posterior to the ligament in the retroperitoneum.",

            "description": "In ovarian torsion, the ovary twists around the adnexal ligaments, resulting in compression of the ovarian veins and lymphatics, consequently causing venous congestion and edema. The most important risk factor is ovarian enlargement, which can occur (e.g., due to ovarian cysts).",

        "explanation_why": "Taste to the posterior third of the tongue is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve and would therefore not be impaired in central facial nerve palsy. Facial nerve palsy may affect taste sensation in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, since this region is innervated by the parasympathetic fibers supplied by the chorda tympani. However, central facial nerve palsy causes contralateral deficits, and a lesion to the precentral gyrus, the location of the primary motor cortex, does not affect taste.",

The facial motor nucleus has two regions: one that supplies the muscles of the forehead and a second that supplies the rest of the face. The branches of the facial nerve that innervate the forehead are activated by both cerebral hemispheres, whereas the branches innervating the lower portion of the face are only activated by the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. As a result, the forehead is spared with unilateral infarction of the precentral gyrus, while the contralateral lower face becomes paralyzed.",

            "description": "Symptoms in central facial palsy are caused by a contralateral upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion. Because muscles responsible for eyelid and forehead movements are innervated by upper motor neuron fibers from both hemispheres, their function is preserved in central facial palsy. In peripheral facial palsy, damage to lower motor neuron (LMN) fibers results in ipsilateral paralysis of all facial muscles. Because sensory and autonomic fibers join the lower motor neuron fibers of the facial nerve in its peripheral course, peripheral facial palsies can also manifest with non-motoric symptoms.",

Decreased lacrimation of the left eye would be expected in left-sided peripheral facial palsy. However, central facial nerve palsy causes contralateral deficits, and a lesion to the precentral gyrus, the location of the primary motor cortex, does not affect lacrimation.",

        "explanation_why": "Lumbar vertebral body can be affected by hematogenous osteomyelitis. However, pain would be localized in the spine, not in the leg. Hematogenous osteomyelitis would also be more commonly found in adults than in children. This is due to the fact that, as aging occurs, metaphysis metabolism slows down, blood flow decreases, and phagocytic activity increases. The vertebrae become more vascular with maturation, which increases the possibility of bacteria seeding to vertebral bodies.",

        "explanation_why": "Hematogenous osteomyelitis is most common in children and adolescents (> 50% of cases occur in children ≤ 5 years). The metaphyseal blood supply is unique, in that the nutrient artery supplying the metaphysis makes a sharp loop before it empties into sinusoidal spaces, where the rate of blood flow is decreased. This creates a medium for bacteria to proliferate. The focus of infection in the metaphysis leads to cellulitis in the bone marrow. Inflammation in the marrow causes increased intramedullary pressure, which forces the exudate into the cortex, where it can rupture through the periosteum. More than 80% of cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis occur in the long bones, the femur and tibia being the most common, and cases usually originate in the metaphyses.",

However, the pain would be located in the groin or hip area, and patients might hold their hip in a passive external rotation. Furthermore, fever, chills, and an elevated ESR would be highly unlikely. The epiphysis derives its blood supply from peri-articular vascular anastomoses, which enter the epiphysis through vascular foramina. After 18 months of age, the number and size of these foramina decrease, thereby reducing the chance of hematogenous seeding.",

However, in Ewing sarcoma, the pain would worsen at night, and peak incidence would be between 10–15 years of age. The diaphysis derives its blood supply from the overlying periosteum via a high-flow periosteal capillary network. As a result, pathogens less commonly lodge in the diaphysis.",

However, Paget disease occurs more commonly in adults > 55 years of age than in children, and fever or chills would not be typical. The acetabulum, like most flat bones, is not commonly affected by osteomyelitis. This is because the articular surface of the acetabulum is made of pure hyaline cartilage and has no blood vessels, resulting in immunity to hematogenous seeding.",

They are caused by a reduction in the activity of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. Lacunar infarcts are noncortical infarcts, characterized by the absence of cortical signs. Subthalamic strokes are usually ischemic in etiology, and uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a significant smoking history are known risk factors.",

The pain radiates from her lower back over her left outer thigh and knee towards the top of her big toe. Physical examination shows a diminished posterior tibial reflex on the left side.

            "description": "Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is required as a cofactor for methylation reactions and cannot be produced by the body. The process of vitamin B12 absorption from food is complex.Vitamin B12 is usually absorbed by binding to another food protein (Cbl-Prot). These complexes are cleaved by HCl and pepsin in the stomach. Cobalamin then binds to haptocorrin (HC), which protects it from gastric acid. Once this complex reaches the duodenum, which has a significantly higher pH value, this protective mechanism is no longer required and the cobalamin and haptocorrin complex (Cbl-HC) is cleaved by trypsin. A complex of cobalamin and intrinsic factor (Cbl-IF) forms to prepare cobalamin for absorption. There are cubilin receptors present in the terminal ileum that recognize intrinsic factor and initiate endocytosis of the Cbl-IF complex in enterocytes (intestinal absorptive cells).Cobalamin is cleaved from intrinsic factor in the enterocytes (see box) and transferred to the transport protein transcobalamin II (Tc). Cobalamin is then bound to Tc and enters the bloodstream, at which point it is distributed throughout the body.One of the most important storage sites for cobalamin is the liver, the site of inactive precursor activation.",

        "explanation_why": "Approximately 90% of anal fissures occur at the posterior midline of the anal canal, distal to the pectinate line (dentate line). The etiology is usually benign and primary in nature, with the most common cause being local trauma (e.g., passing of hard stools due to constipation), persistent diarrhea, vaginal delivery, or anal sex. This predilection for the posterior midline is likely due to poor perfusion to this area. Acute anal fissures typically resolve with conservative management.",

Deep peroneal nerve compression can be caused by tight-fitting shoes, which are suggested by this patient's hallux valgus deformity (bunion). It may also occur following trauma, especially navicular fracture.",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The anal canal is anatomically divided by the pectinate line into the upper two thirds, which is embryologically derived from the hindgut (endoderm), and the lower third, which is derived from ectoderm. The artery supply, venous drainage, lymphatic drainage, and nerve supply of the region of the anal canal above the dentate line (pectinate line) are, therefore, different from those of the region below this line.",

        "explanation_why": "The region of the anal canal above the dentate line drains into the portal venous system via the following pathway: superior rectal vein → inferior mesenteric vein → splenic vein → hepatic portal vein. Adenocarcinomas typically arise in this region and usually result in hepatic metastases. The region of the anal canal below the dentate line drains into systemic venous circulation via the following pathway: inferior rectal vein → internal pudendal vein → internal iliac vein → inferior vena cava. Squamous cell carcinomas typically arise in this region. The principles of the upper and lower anal canal's venous drainage are not only relevant for predicting the most likely route of hematogenous spread of malignancies, but also for understanding first pass metabolism in rectal drug administration. First pass metabolism is higher if the drug drains via the superior rectal vein into the hepatic portal circulation.",

The hepatic portal vein thus transports blood to the liver that is rich in nutrients but deoxygenated (therefore represented in blue). Following metabolization in the liver, the blood then passes via the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava to join systemic circulation.",

The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) arises from the anterior surface of the aorta at the level of the L3 vertebra. Occlusion at the opening of the IMA by a thrombus within an aortic aneurysm (suggested by the filling defect) would cause acute mesenteric ischemia and, potentially, necrosis of the bowel segments supplied by this artery.",

Given this patient's history of progressively worsening left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath, pneumothorax should be considered as a possible diagnosis. A tension pneumothorax can cause tracheal deviation away from the affected side, due to increased intrathoracic pressure. However, x-ray findings in pneumothorax would include absent lung markings and areas of increased radiolucency rather than the large opacity and air-fluid level seen here.",

Trauma to the chest can cause the ribs to pierce the pleura and damage intrathoracic vessels, which can lead to accumulation of blood in the pleural space. There is tracheal deviation to the opposite side due to the increasing volume in the pleural space. A hemothorax cannot be diagnosed with x-ray alone (diagnosis usually requires CT imaging or thoracentesis) but given the patient's recent trauma, this is the most likely etiology.",

In view of the trauma history, the likely causes are pulmonary contusion and hemothorax. The slightly high position of the gastric bubble (GB) also suggests the presence of left lower lobe atelectasis.

Three months post-vasectomy, a follow-up examination is conducted to test semen samples for azoospermia to determine the success of the procedure before ceasing to use alternative methods of contraception. Patients should also be counseled about the small risk of post-vasectomy pregnancy (approximately 1 in 2000 cases) due to recanalization.\n\nOther complications of a vasectomy include surgical site infection, sperm granulomas, post-vasectomy pain syndrome, hematomas, and failure of the procedure (persistence of sperm in the ejaculate).",

    "difficulty": 2,

        "explanation_why": "Dorsiflexion of the foot is accomplished through contraction of muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg, including the tibialis anterior (main dorsiflexor), extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneus tertius. These muscles are innervated by the deep peroneal nerve, which branches from the common peroneal nerve. Injury to the common peroneal nerve, either from the initial fibula fracture or, more likely, compression from the plaster cast, explains this patient's numbness and would result in impaired dorsiflexion and eversion on motor examination. Patients with injury to the common peroneal nerve typically present with steppage gait.\n\nThe common peroneal nerve gives rise to the superficial peroneal nerve, which innervates the dorsum of the foot, and the deep peroneal nerve, which innervates the web space between the first two toes.",

Direct injury to these muscles or damage to the tibial nerve, which innervates these muscles, would make it impossible to stand on one's tiptoes, but this patient's history of isolated fracture of the fibular neck does not suggest these pathologies.",

Damage to it would not result in changes in cutaneous sensation, which is consistent with this patient's symptoms. However, weakness with finger extension would not be expected in an injury to this nerve, either. The classic physical examination finding in patients with AIN injuries is an inability to make the “A-OK” sign with the thumb and index finger, although injury to this branch alone is rare.",

It is a purely sensory nerve and provides cutaneous innervation to the radial half of the dorsal hand, the thumb, the index finger, and the radial half of the dorsal long finger (except for the tips of the fingers, which are innervated by the median nerve). However, this patient has no cutaneous sensory symptoms. Furthermore, injury to this nerve would not account for her motor changes.",

        "explanation_why": "The posterior interosseous nerve is a motor nerve that branches off from the radial nerve in close proximity to the radial head, which makes it susceptible to injury due to radial head dislocation or subluxation. Occasionally, posterior interosseous neuropathy can develop years after a fracture of the forearm or elbow. Compression of this nerve frequently impairs extension of the fingers (more than the wrist) because function of the extensor carpi radialis longus, which is innervated directly by the radial nerve, is preserved. The unopposed action of this muscle further explains the radial deviation seen on examination. Finally, this patient's normal sensory examination is one of the hallmarks of posterior interosseous neuropathy because this nerve does not provide cutaneous innervation.\n\nThe posterior interosseous nerve can also be compressed within the radial tunnel (radial tunnel syndrome).",

It is tested for as follows:\n(1) The pelvic level is assessed by comparing the height of both iliac crests.\n(2) The patient is asked to stand on one leg, with the examiner continuously observing the level of the pelvis and the patient's posture. Normally, the pelvis is stabilized by the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles, which prevent a pelvic drop to the opposite side.\n(3) In the case of muscle insufficiency, the pelvis drops toward the unimpaired, unsupported side (free leg), which is known as the Trendelenburg sign.\n(4) Tilting of the torso toward the contralateral side compensates for the pelvic drop on the unimpaired side, which is known as Duchenne sign. Because the Duchenne sign may mask the Trendelenburg sign, it is important to always inspect the patient's overall posture.",

    "hint": "A groin swelling that worsens with standing, coughing, and straining is suggestive of a hernia. In a patient with a hernia, severe pain and features of bowel obstruction (e.g., nausea, vomiting) indicate strangulation. As the swelling is located below the midpoint of the inguinal canal, a femoral hernia is the most likely diagnosis.",

If a patient has a posterior sag sign from their PCL injury, then the affected tibia is posteriorly displaced when the knee is flexed (as when performing an anterior drawer test). If the examiner is not aware of the posterior sag and performs an anterior drawer test, the affected knee will feel as though it has significantly more anterior movement compared to the unaffected knee (because the affected knee started from a posteriorly displaced position) and may be mistaken for a positive anterior drawer test.

            "description": "Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells and primarily originate within the vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII. The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

Symptoms of pinealomas include visual disturbances and dizziness or recurrent headaches (due to hydrocephalus). However, pinealomas are associated with vertical gaze palsy rather than the bitemporal hemianopsia observed in this patient. Moreover, menstrual disturbances would not be expected, as pinealomas are hormonally inactive.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "A combination of external rotation and abduction of the arm, flattening of the shoulder contour, and palpation of the humeral head below the coracoid process is indicative of anterior shoulder dislocation. The axillary nerve is stretched over the displaced head of the humerus (neurapraxia), making it especially prone to injury.",

        "explanation_why": "The nerve most commonly damaged as a result of anterior shoulder dislocation is the axillary nerve, which has a dermatome over the lateral shoulder. This injury thus often causes loss of sensation in this area.",

Other nerves that can be injured in skull base fractures involving the superior orbital fissure are the oculomotor nerve (ptosis with a fixed and dilated pupil), trochlear nerve (ocular extorsion and vertical diplopia), and ophthalmic nerve (absent corneal reflex). CN VI palsy is the most common cranial nerve palsy because of the long and tortuous route that CN VI takes intracranially, along which the nerve is vulnerable to injury by trauma (as in this patient), neoplasms (e.g., sphenoid ridge meningiomas), increased ICP (e.g., pseudotumor cerebri, SAH), neurovascular pathologies (e.g., cavernous sinus thrombosis, carotid-cavernous fistulas), and infection (e.g., syphilis).",

Because muscles responsible for eyelid and forehead movements are innervated by upper motor neuron fibers from both hemispheres, their function is preserved in central facial palsy. In peripheral facial palsy, damage to lower motor neuron (LMN) fibers results in ipsilateral paralysis of all facial muscles. Because sensory and autonomic fibers join the lower motor neuron fibers of the facial nerve in its peripheral course, peripheral facial palsies can also manifest with non-motoric symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "The pudendal nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the perineum, external genitalia, and external urethral and anal sphincter muscles. A reflex erection occurs on tactile stimulation of the genital area, which stimulates the afferent fibers of the pudendal nerve. This activates a reflex arc with the parasympathetic nervous system at the sacral roots originating at S2 to S4, forwarding the stimulus to the inferior hypogastric plexus. This, in turn, leads to relaxation of the cavernous smooth muscle, which causes vasodilation (mediated by nitric oxide) and erection. The pudendal nerve may be injured in pelvic fractures or pelvic surgeries.",

The femoral nerve can also be damaged by pelvic trauma. However, it would manifest with further motor deficits, including impaired knee extension and a decreased patellar tendon reflex (paralysis of quadriceps femoris muscle). Additionally, sensory deficits of the anteromedial thigh (anterior cutaneous branches), medial lower leg, and medial edge of the foot (saphenous nerve lesion) would be expected instead of perineal hypesthesia, an absent sphincter reflex, and urinary incontinence.",

However, damage to the ilioinguinal nerve results in sensory loss in the root of the penis and the anterior scrotum, and damage to the genitofemoral nerve results in decreased sensation to the anteromedial thigh, neither of which is seen here. In addition, right-sided perineal hypesthesia and absent anal sphincter contraction would not be expected.",

Any dissection of the infundibulopelvic ligament should be performed with great care because of the risk of iatrogenic ureteral injury. Patients with fibrosis or endometriosis are at especially high risk of iatrogenic ureter injury during this surgical step.\n\nBecause of their long retroperitoneal course, the ureters are at risk of injury during lower abdominal procedures, such as gonadal vessel ligation, uterine vessel ligation, pelvic dissection, and dissection at the ureterovesical junction.",

These structures provide support and allow for flexible movement of the uterus between the urinary bladder and the rectum, especially during pregnancy.- The round ligament extends from the lateral horn of the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall and via the inguinal canal to the labia majora.\n- The largest ligament is the broad ligament of the uterus, a peritoneal fold that connects the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall. The broad ligament can be divided into the mesosalpinx, the mesovarium, and the mesometrium.\n- The ovaries are suspended from the uterus by the ovarian ligament and from the lateral pelvic wall by the suspensory (infundibulopelvic) ligament of the ovary.\n- The cardinal ligament encloses the uterine artery and vein and connects the cervix with the lateral pelvic wall.\n- The uterosacral ligament connects the cervix to the sacrum.",

        "explanation_why": "A right lateral corticospinal tract injury (e.g., partial Brown-Sequard syndrome) would result in the absence of ipsilateral motor function below injury level. The lateral corticospinal tract decussates at the level of the medulla. An injury distal to the decussation (e.g., at the level of T1) would, therefore, affect ipsilateral motor function below the level of the injury. In a full Brown-Sequard syndrome (e.g., hemisection of the spinal cord), there would also be ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception below T1 (dorsal column), ipsilateral Babinski sign (lateral corticospinal tract), and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation beginning two levels below the lesion (lateral spinothalamic tract).",

The abductor pollicis brevis is a muscle of the thenar eminence that arises from the flexor retinaculum and the scaphoid bone, before inserting into the proximal phalanx and the capsule of the first metacarpophalangeal joint. This muscle is responsible for thumb abduction, extension, and opposition. Damage to the median nerve leads to a weakness of these functions, especially abduction, which can be assessed by the pen test.

Spigelian hernias occur through defects in the linea semilunaris of the anterior abdominal wall. The linea semilunaris is a curved, vertical line at the lateral edge of each rectus abdominis muscle that is composed of the aponeurotic fibers of the internal oblique muscle as they merge with the rectus sheath. Spigelian hernias are therefore bounded medially by the rectus abdominis. These hernias are occasionally palpable as a subcutaneous bulge. However, they are most commonly intraperitoneal and may not be evident on examination. Because the fascial defects are typically small, there is a high risk of bowel strangulation; surgical repair is therefore indicated.",

Intrathoracic neurofibromas usually manifest in young adults (20–30 years), typically with chest pain caused by mass effect upon the chest wall. Although neurofibromas are benign, large masses can cause a dry cough (due to compression of the lung), hoarseness (due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve), or dysphagia (due to compression of the vagus nerve). As in this case, constitutional symptoms (i.e., fever and weight loss) are usually absent and laboratory studies are typically normal.",

Important risk factors for uterine prolapse include age, high body mass index (BMI), multiparity, and obstetric conditions resulting from excessive stretching and tearing. Uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) is a corrective procedure that involves stitching the uterosacral ligaments to the apex of the vagina, thereby restoring normal support to the top of the vagina.",

The most common site for stress fractures near the elbow is the olecranon process, and individuals involved in racket sports are at increased risk of developing this overuse injury. However, patients with olecranon stress fractures typically present with pain over the posterior surface of the elbow and exacerbation of pain with extension of the forearm against resistance. Given the pain on the lateral surface of the forearm and exacerbation of pain with wrist extension against resistance seen here, a different diagnosis is likely.",

Although individuals who practice racket sports are at increased risk of developing these conditions, a compression neuropathy would typically result in distal weakness in the affected arm. Cubital tunnel syndrome and pronator teres syndrome would also result in sensory loss and/or paresthesias.\n\nCompression of the posterior interosseous nerve within the radial tunnel occasionally results in pain on the lateral surface of the elbow without motor weakness, sensory deficits, or paresthesias (radial tunnel syndrome). In approximately 5% of patients, radial tunnel syndrome occurs in conjunction with lateral epicondylitis. However, in radial tunnel syndrome, pain typically affects the dorsal aspect of the proximal forearm rather than the distal humerus.",

In patients with lateral epicondylitis, the pain can be exacerbated by resisted supination, resisted wrist extension, and tight grasping of objects.

        "explanation_why": "Repeated wrist flexion can cause medial epicondylitis, which can affect individuals involved in racket sports and manifests with elbow pain. However, the pain would be present on the medial surface of the elbow and it would be exacerbated by forearm pronation and/or wrist flexion. Moreover, medial epicondylitis is 5–10 times less common than lateral epicondylitis.",

Right foot eversion is 1/5. There is no weakness upon dorsiflexion. Which of the following nerves is most likely injured in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "A tibial nerve injury causes impaired motor function of the flexor muscles of the foot, leading to an inability to invert the foot or walk on the toes or balls of the foot, none of which is seen here. Patients will also experience sensory loss on the sole of the foot, not the dorsum of the foot. Moreover, injury during a lateral fasciotomy is unlikely because the tibial nerve is located in the deep posterior compartment of the leg.",

Moreover, patients will not present with motor findings. Finally, injury to this nerve during lateral fasciotomy is unlikely given its location on the posterior aspect of the leg.",

        "explanation_why": "The superficial peroneal nerve supplies motor innervation to the lateral compartment of the leg, the main functions of which are foot eversion and plantar flexion. Injury to this nerve compromises foot eversion but does not affect dorsiflexion, which is produced by the anterior compartment of the leg that is innervated by the deep peroneal nerve. The superficial peroneal nerve also supplies sensory innervation to the distal part of the anterolateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum of the foot (except for the first web space); injury to this nerve thus results in loss of sensation in this area.\n\nThis patient originally presented with features of compartment syndrome (severe leg swelling and pain, increased compartment pressure) and underwent emergency fasciotomy, which is associated with a risk of nerve injury. Risk factors for compartment syndrome include animal venoms (e.g., rattlesnake bites), circumferential burns, long bone fractures, and crush injuries.",

Small portions of the right hemidiaphragm are obscured, which suggests that the right lower lobe is involved. Close proximity to the right heart border also raises the question of right middle lobe (medial segment) involvement. PA and lateral views could help distinguish lower and middle lobe involvement. The radiographic findings favor aspiration as the cause of pneumonia. The lower lobe of the right lung is the most common site of aspiration pneumonia in an erect patient due to the vertical orientation of the right main bronchus and its larger caliber compared to the left main bronchus.",

The etiology is not yet fully understood, but risk factors include breech presentation, female sex, and a family history of DDH. Most cases of DDH involve the left hip. Physical examination typically shows leg length discrepancy, hip instability, limited or asymmetrical hip abduction, asymmetrical gluteal folds, and a positive Galeazzi sign.\n\nEarly detection of DDH is important, as the prognosis worsens with increasing age. Hip ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice in all infants younger than 4 months of age. A harness is the treatment of choice for infants with DDH who are younger than 6 months of age.",

It first descends posterior to the trachea, and then posterior to the heart. At the level of the 4^th thoracic vertebra, the aorta runs adjacent to the esophagus, pushing it slightly to the right. The esophagus passes through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm at the level of the 10^th thoracic vertebra and ends at the stomach after a brief stretch within the peritoneum.The upper part of the trachea, lungs, and heart are not shown for clarity.",

Positioning the patient in the left-lateral decubitus position increases filling of the left atrium and can thus amplify the heart sound on auscultation. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy decreases ventricle compliance, which is classically seen in advanced age. In this middle-aged, physically inactive patient, the most likely antecedent cause for left ventricular hypertrophy is hypertensive heart disease secondary to persistently increased afterload.",

        "explanation_why": "The trigeminal nerve (CN V) exits the brain at the middle cerebellar peduncle, and its motor nucleus is located in the lateral portion of the upper pons. This patient has an infarct of the left lateral pons that involves this nucleus. As a result, the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V_3), which innervates the muscles of mastication (e.g., the lateral pterygoid muscle), could be affected and result in difficulty chewing and ipsilateral deviation of the jaw.\n\nA lesion of the left lateral pons can also affect the nuclei of the facial nerve (CN VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). Therefore, patients with lateral pontine syndrome can also develop ipsilateral facial paralysis (CN VII) and ipsilateral hearing loss, vertigo, and nystagmus (CN VIII). The nucleus of the abducens nerve (CN VI) is located in the medial portion of the pons and is therefore not typically affected in individuals with lateral pontine syndrome.",

Therefore, this patient's history of trauma and x-ray findings (fractures of all four pubic rami) are consistent with a torn posterior urethra.

There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up).",

        "explanation_why": "Omphalocele is a congenital ventral wall defect in which protrusion of the abdominal contents covered with peritoneum occurs at the site of umbilical cord insertion. Although maternal serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) is also elevated in this condition (due to leakage of AFP into the amniotic fluid and maternal circulation), fetal ultrasound shows midline herniation of abdominal contents within a hernia sac in contrast to the free-floating viscera seen on this patient's prenatal ultrasound. In addition, omphalocele is commonly associated with other congenital diseases, including trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, evidence of which is not described in the fetus.",

        "explanation_why": "Venous blood flowing from the deep popliteal vein to the superficial small saphenous vein indicates retrograde blood flow and confirms the diagnosis of chronic venous disease. Normally, the small saphenous vein would arise from the dorsal venous arch and drain into the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction. In a patient with chronic venous disease, however, incompetence of the venous valves caused by elevated venous pressure (e.g., due to pregnancy, increased BMI, prior thrombosis) leads to blood reflux from deep into superficial veins. This results in the formation of varicose veins, and ultimately edema and skin changes (e.g., stasis dermatitis), as seen in this patient. First-line treatment consists of conservative measures such as leg elevation, compression therapy, and application of topical dermatologic agents.",

            "description": "The superficial veins are depicted in the right leg:\n- Great saphenous vein: arises from the medial end of the dorsal venous arch, courses in front of the medial malleolus, up the medial aspect of the leg, behind the medial border of the patella, and up the medial aspect of the thigh. It terminates by draining into the femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction, which is typically located ~4 cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle.\n- Short saphenous vein: arises from the lateral end of the dorsal venous arch, courses behind the lateral malleolus, and up the posterior aspect of the leg. It terminates by draining into the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction, which usually lies in the popliteal fossa (not shown here).The deep veins are depicted in the left leg:\n- Peripheral deep veins: anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular (peroneal) veins\n- Popliteal vein: formed by the confluence of the peripheral deep veins\n- Femoral vein: continuation of the popliteal vein. It begins at the adductor hiatus and accompanies the femoral artery throughout its course. The deep femoral vein (profunda femoris) is the main tributary of the femoral vein.\n- External iliac vein: continuation of the femoral vein. It begins behind the inguinal ligament and drains into the common iliac vein.",

Periesophageal vagus nerve injury, which may occur during thoracic or gastric surgery, typically manifests with delayed gastric emptying. Other symptoms of vagus nerve injury depend on the level at which the lesion is located and include loss of the gag reflex, vocal cord paralysis (manifesting as hoarseness), and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., impaired heart rate variability).\n\nFurther causes of vagus nerve injury include diabetic neuropathy, trauma, and inflammation.",

In surgeries that require the patient to be in a prone position (e.g., spinal surgery), improper positioning of the arms can compress and injure this nerve. This injury leads to paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, which manifests with medial winging of the scapula and weakened abduction of the shoulder above 90° (manifesting, e.g., during hair combing), as seen here. Further common causes of long thoracic nerve injury include invasive procedures (e.g., axillary lymph node dissection), direct trauma to the shoulder, and prolonged nerve compression (e.g., carrying a heavy backpack).\n\nThe musculocutaneous nerve also receives nerve fibers from C5–C7 spinal roots, but it arises as a branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus rather than directly from the spinal roots. Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve (e.g., a gunshot wound in the arm) manifests with loss of sensation over the lateral forearm and impaired flexion and supination of the forearm.",

It can be injured during femoral vascular access procedures, abdominal surgery, and pelvic surgery. The nerve that was injured during this patient's pelvic procedure lies in the obturator foramen, which does not contain the femoral nerve.",

The superior gluteal nerve is the only nerve that exits the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle.\nThe sciatic nerve branches at the popliteal fossa into the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve.\n\nThe cutaneous nerves penetrate through the deep fascia and enter the subcutaneous plane to supply their dermatomes.\nThe sural nerve is a cutaneous nerve formed by the union of the medial sural cutaneous nerve (originating from the tibial nerve) and the lateral sural cutaneous nerve (originating from the common peroneal nerve).\nThe medial and lateral plantar nerves are the cutaneous terminal branches of the tibial nerve.",

This patient's signs and symptoms are due to common bile duct obstruction (leading to elevated parameters of cholestasis such as γ-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and direct bilirubin) and consequent biliary tract spasms. In addition to the occluding gallstone, ultrasonography typically shows a dilated common bile duct with possible intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Choledocholithiasis is treated with spasmolytics, analgesia, and removal of the stone, usually via ERCP. An elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is commonly indicated to prevent a recurrence.",

HSV-1 encephalitis is the most common cause of KBS as the virus shows neurotropism with a predilection for the medial temporal lobe. Symptoms of KBS include hyperorality, hyperphagia, docility, cognitive dysfunction, and visual agnosia. MRI is the most sensitive modality, particularly in the early stages of disease, and would show bilateral hyperintense temporal lobe lesions. Other causes of KBS include head trauma, stroke, malignancy, and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer, Pick, Parkinson, and Huntington disease).\n\nIf active HSV infection is suspected, treatment is with IV acyclovir; otherwise, therapy with psychotropic medications is recommended.",

Although the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in the US have been decreasing as a result of Pap smear screening, if it is not detected or left untreated, it can invade adjacent structures, one of which is the bladder wall. The progressive invasion of the bladder wall can lead to the obstruction of the ureters, which causes hydronephrosis. Cervical cancer can also cause hydronephrosis by direct obstruction of the ureters (proximal to the bladder). Hydronephrosis increases the retrograde hydrostatic pressure within tubules. Consequently, bilateral hydronephrosis can lead to a decline in the glomerular filtration rate, ultimately resulting in acute renal failure. Other local complications of invasive cervical cancer include fistula formation and lower extremity edema caused by the compression of veins or lymphatics in the lower pelvis.",

When resecting an insulinoma in the tail of the pancreas (distal pancreatectomy), the surgeon will dissect the splenorenal ligament and possibly the spleen (because of the high risk of splenic metastasis in the case of neuroendocrine tumors).

Ruptured PCA aneurysms commonly manifest with unilateral findings including contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (due to infarction of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe), contralateral paresis (due to infarction of the corticospinal tract in the midbrain), and contralateral sensory loss (due to infarction of the ventral posterolateral nucleus or the ascending sensory tracts). If damage occurs to the dominant (most commonly left) hemisphere, patients present with alexia without agraphia, anomic aphasia, and visual agnosia. If damage occurs to the nondominant (most commonly right) hemisphere, patients present with prosopagnosia. A PCA hemorrhage is unlikely to explain this patient's bilateral symptoms.",

The junction between the ACom and one of the paired anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) is the most common site of cerebral saccular aneurysms, which can manifest with bitemporal hemianopia (due to compression of the optic chiasm). Aneurysm rupture causes findings characteristic of infarction of the arterial territory of the ACA, including contralateral paralysis and sensory deficits more prominent in the lower than the upper extremity (due to infarction of the motor and sensory cortices of the lower extremity) and urinary incontinence.

This artery supplies a large part of the lateral cortex (including the lateral portion of the frontal and parietal lobes, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, putamen, globus pallidus, and parts of the internal capsule and caudate nucleus). MCA aneurysm rupture causes contralateral paralysis and sensory deficits more prominent in the face and upper extremity (due to infarction of the motor and sensory cortices of the upper body parts). If damage occurs in the dominant (most commonly left) hemisphere, patients present with aphasia. If damage occurs in the nondominant (most commonly right) hemisphere, patients present with hemineglect. An MCA hemorrhage is unlikely to explain this patient's bilateral symptoms.",

This artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord and the lower medulla at the midline. Bleeding from an aneurysm of the ASA can cause bilateral medial medullary syndrome with quadriplegia (due to bilateral infarction of the corticospinal tract), loss of proprioception (due to bilateral infarction of the medial lemniscus), and anarthria (due to bilateral infarction of the nucleus of cranial nerve XII in the lower medulla). However, ASA hemorrhage would not explain this patient's bulbar palsy, paralysis of the face and neck muscles, or loss of horizontal eye movements.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The basilar artery is located on the ventral surface of the pons and contributes to the posterior cerebral circulation. A ruptured basilar artery aneurysm can cause locked-in syndrome by causing bilateral damage to the midbrain, which contains cranial nerve III (CN III) and CN IV nuclei, pons (containing CN V, VI, VII, and VIII nuclei), medulla (containing CN IX, X, XI, and XII nuclei), and corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts. Peripheral motor symptoms (e.g., quadriplegia, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, and positive Babinski signs in both legs) are caused by bilateral interruption of the corticospinal tracts. Bulbar palsy and paralysis of the face and neck muscles are caused by bilateral interruption of the corticobulbar tracts and damage to the motoric cranial nerve nuclei of CN V, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Horizontal gaze palsy is caused by damage to ocular cranial nerve nuclei (CN VI) and associated visual paths in the paramedian pontine reticular formation. Despite the extensive injury, many vital functions persist due to collateral blood supply to the midbrain tectum (preserved blinking and vertical eye movement), reticular activating system (preserved consciousness), cerebral cortex (preserved language comprehension and cognition), and spinothalamic tracts coursing through the dorsal pons (preserved sensation). See “Clinical features of stroke by affected vessel” table.\n\nManagement of locked-in syndrome includes physiotherapy, which consists of passive stretching exercises and frequent repositioning to avoid decubitus ulcers. Patients learn to communicate using blinking, vertical eye movements, eye-gaze sensor-controlled computer communication programs, and speech synthesizers. Some patients may recover some motor control, breathing, swallowing, and/or speaking ability.",

He recently started his job as a painter. One month ago, he had to quit his job because the symptoms worsened whenever he tried to reach above his head. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He does not smoke and drinks two beers daily. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to fine touch in the 4^th and 5^th fingers of his right hand.

        "explanation_why": "A cervical rib is a common cause of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which occurs because of compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (derived from the C8–T1 nerve roots) and/or subclavian vessels in the area of the scalene triangle. Compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus can cause neuropathic pain, paresthesias, and sensory loss in the C8 and T1 dermatomes (i.e., 4^th and 5^th fingers, medial aspect of the arm), as seen here, and possibly weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. The symptoms in the case of a cervical rib are usually exacerbated by overhead arm elevation. Compression of the subclavian vessels is less common; subclavian vein compression results in swelling of the arm, and subclavian artery compression can cause acute or chronic limb ischemia and, possibly, subclavian steal syndrome. A positive Adson test, as seen here, is suggestive of a cervical rib. Other common causes of TOS are Pancoast tumor, muscular anomalies (e.g., supernumerary scalene muscles, neck muscle hypertrophy), and trauma (e.g., clavicle fracture).",

            "title": "Femoral hernia",
            "description": "Femoral hernia passes through the vascular lacuna (internal hernial orifice), below the inguinal ligament and usually medial to the femoral vein and runs through the femoral canal until it reaches the saphenous opening (external hernial orifice; approx. 2cm caudal).The saphenous opening typically contains loose connective and fatty tissue as well as inguinal lymph nodes.Due to the increased width of the female pelvis, and therefore larger vascular lacuna, femoral hernia occurs predominantly in women.",

The etiology of Peyronie disease is not well understood but has been associated with penile trauma, including both acute traumatic events and repetitive microtrauma during sexual activity. The consequent wound healing is thought to result in abnormal fibrous plaque formation. Affected patients may experience pain, irregular engorgement, and erectile dysfunction due to an abnormal curvature of the penis. Treatment includes oral pentoxifylline or intralesional collagenase injections; surgical repair may be necessary in refractory cases.",

Injury to the posterior spinal cord can, therefore, cause sensory ataxia that is worse in dimly lit settings, where a patient's proprioception cannot compensate for the loss of visual bearings. However, this patient's broad-based gait and inability to perform a Romberg test are not environment-dependent. In addition, there is no indication that she has other sensory deficits. Moreover, posterior spinal cord injury is not associated with nystagmus, head tilting, or truncal ataxia (e.g., inability to sit upright without propping oneself up on the hands).",

Bulbar corticonuclear fibers extend to each of the cranial nerve nuclei, which innervate the facial muscles. The remaining fibers descend from the brainstem as two divisions of the corticospinal tract. Approximately 80% of these fibers decussate at the level of the medulla (pyramidal decussation) to the contralateral side to form the lateral corticospinal tract. They then descend into the spinal cord to innervate the limbs and digits. The remaining approximately 20% of fibers descend from the brainstem ipsilaterally, forming the anterior corticospinal tract. These decussate at the spinal level of the trunk muscles they innervate.",

During this time, she has also had intermittent pain in her right arm for which treatment with ibuprofen has provided some relief. She is a professional tennis player but has not been able to practice because her symptoms get worse when she swings the racquet overhead. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her only medication is a vitamin supplement. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 110/73 mm Hg. Physical examination of the right hand shows decreased sensation to light touch in the 4^th and 5^th fingers. Repeated opening and closing of the hands with the arms raised above the shoulder causes pain and a sensation of heaviness in the right arm. Percussion over the right medial epicondyle of the humerus does not reproduce the symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

However, the paresthesia usually develops along the lateral aspects of the arm, forearm, and/or hand (C5–C6 dermatomes), not the 4^th and 5^th digits. Moreover, patients with Erb palsy typically present with an internally rotated and adducted arm, extended forearm, and a flexed wrist (“waiter's tip posture”).",

If the C8–T1 spinal roots are affected, pain and paresthesia develop in the 4^th and 5^th digits. However, patients with cervical radiculopathy will have an improvement in their symptoms with overhead arm elevation, and the Roos stress test is typically negative. Although an epidural glucocorticoid injection might relieve this patient's pain, it is not the next most appropriate step in management.",

Symptoms are typically worse at night. Severe compression of the median nerve can also cause motor symptoms (e.g., thenar muscle weakness and atrophy).",

She is a mixed martial arts athlete and has been training intensively for an upcoming tournament. The pain started soon after she received a blow to the ear during a training fight. She reports taking ibuprofen for the pain and tried “not to pay attention to it,” but the pain has worsened. Her personal and family history is unremarkable and she takes no other medications. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.0°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 113/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 3-cm mildly tender, fluctuant mass on the right antihelix with purple skin discoloration; there is a firm, irregular, nontender deformity of the left auricle. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

Timely drainage of the hematoma prevents infection, relieves pressure, and preserves ear function and appearance, preventing the formation of cauliflower ear, which this patient already has in the left ear. Prophylactic antibiotics with coverage against skin flora and P. aeruginosa such as ciprofloxacin should also be considered. Patients should be followed up daily to assess for reaccumulation of the hematoma and/or signs of infection. If the hematoma does not reaccumulate, patients can return to sports after 7 days.",

As most individuals who develop auricular hematomas are involved in some sort of contact sport and frequently experience injury, they may not see the need to seek medical attention.

She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and does not drink alcohol. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows asymmetrical facial expression with a right-sided drooping mouth, upper eyelid retraction, inability to frown, and loss of forehead wrinkling. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The patient is deeply concerned that her current symptoms are going to be permanent. She asks what her long-term prognosis will be. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's concern?",

        "explanation_why": "Facial nerve palsy can be caused by stroke. In patients with suspected stroke, imaging of the head (e.g., CT, MRI) is an important diagnostic tool. However, the palsy in stroke is of central rather than peripheral origin. Although the conditions have similar symptoms (e.g., drooping mouth), the inability to frown and close the eyelid are not features of central facial nerve palsy. Imaging studies are not routinely performed in Bell palsy.",

        "explanation_why": "Peripheral facial nerve palsy is most commonly idiopathic (i.e., Bell palsy). The diagnosis is made clinically after conducting a thorough medical history and physical examination. Bell palsy is treated with oral glucocorticoids (preferably within 72 hours of symptom onset) and most cases resolve within three weeks. Even without treatment, this condition resolves spontaneously in the majority of cases (∼ 70 %) in 3–6 months.\n\nBecause viral reactivation may be the cause of Bell palsy, antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir should be considered in addition to oral glucocorticoids.",

Approx. 50% of patients do not present with B-symptoms. Although mediastinal lymphomas can arise from any mediastinal compartment, airway compression is most commonly associated with superior, anterior, or middle mediastinal masses. Masses that cause superior vena cava syndrome are usually located in the anterior or middle compartments. Esophageal compression typically occurs with superior, middle, or posterior mediastinal masses. While thymoma may also cause anterior and superior mediastinal masses, it usually grows slowly (over several years), in contrast to the rapid development of progressive symptoms in this patient, which is consistent with lymphoma.\n\nSee “Compartments of the mediastinum” table.",
