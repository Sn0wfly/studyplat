Examination in the delivery room shows micrognathia, prominent occiput with flattened nasal bridge, and pointy low-set ears. The eyes are upward slanting with small palpebral fissures. The fists are clenched with fingers tightly flexed. The index finger overlaps the third finger and the fifth finger overlaps the fourth. A 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the lower left sternal border. The nipples are widely spaced and the feet have prominent heels and convex, rounded soles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?",

Classic features include a characteristic craniofacial morphology (micrognathia, prominent occiput, and pointy, low-set ears), clenched fists with flexion contractures of the fingers, and rocker-bottom feet (convex foot deformity with prominent heel). The infant also presents with other features that are commonly associated with the syndrome, such as a congenital heart defect (holosystolic murmur suggestive of VSD) and low birth weight (suggestive of intrauterine growth retardation).",

However, she lacks most other typical features, such as a hypoplastic philtrum, down-slanting and widely spaced palpebral fissures, and narrow forehead. Moreover, this patient's rocker-bottom feet, low-set ears, clenched fists, and prominent occiput would not be seen in FAS.",

This child does exhibit some features of Down syndrome, (e.g., flattened nasal bridge, upward slanting eyes with small palpebral fissures, and presence of VSD), but the absence of all other typical features as well as the presence of additional features (micrognathia, rocker-bottom feet) makes this diagnosis highly unlikely.",

However, in aplastic crisis, the reticulocyte count would be low, whereas this patient's elevated reticulocytes indicate appropriate bone marrow response.

Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are formed early in life, without prior sensitization (unlike anti-Rh antibodies, which require prior exposure to Rh-positive blood). While most of these antibodies are IgM antibodies that cannot pass the placenta, some are IgG antibodies that can enter into fetal circulation during pregnancy and may result in hemolysis when the infant has A or B antigens, as seen here. Only 5–10% of newborns with ABO incompatibility show symptoms. Clinical presentation is typically mild, with hyperbilirubinemia developing within the first 24 hours after birth. Infants of African American descent are usually more severely affected.\n\nAs fetal A and B antigens are not fully developed at birth, a direct Coombs test is usually only weakly positive, demonstrating a partial immune reaction against the RBCs of the infant.",

This complication occurs in Rh-negative mothers, who have developed anti-Rh antibodies from exposure to Rh-positive blood, e.g., via a prior pregnancy and/or delivery. Although the mother has developed anti-D antibodies due to previous exposure to Rh-positive RBCs (as is evident from her positive anti-Rh antibody titer), her daughter is Rh-negative and is therefore not at risk.",

Also, patients typically have a history of bloody diarrhea (unlike this neonate, who has delayed passage of meconium), and the child would appear seriously ill with cardiopulmonary instability.

However, the small bowel would be distended (not the large bowel), since intussusception typically occurs at the ileocolic junction. Moreover, intussusception usually occurs between 5 months and 3 years of age; it is extremely rare in the neonatal period.

Parasympathetic neural crest cells migrate in a rostral to caudal direction, from the foregut to the midgut to the hindgut. Failure of the neural crest cells to complete this migration typically results in an aganglionic distal sigmoid and rectum (i.e., without the myenteric and submucosal plexus). As a result, there is hypertonicity in the walls of the rectum and sigmoid, and the internal anal sphincter fails to relax in response to rectal distention. The net effect is intestinal obstruction and dilation of the colon (megacolon). The diagnosis is confirmed via rectal biopsy, which would show aganglionosis, increased acetylcholinesterase activity, and/or hyperplasia of parasympathetic fibers.",

This condition is characterized by respiratory distress and skin lesions. Although the mother's nonspecific febrile illness in early pregnancy could have been a manifestation of listeriosis, her child's symptoms suggest congenital toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii infection has been associated with the ingestion of contaminated raw goat milk rather than cow milk products.",

        "explanation_why": "This child is dehydrated as evident by dry mucous membranes, irritability, and hypotension (N in 4-week-old term infant = 85 ± 10 systolic: 46 ± 9 diastolic, mm Hg). Vomiting in hypertrophic pyloric stenosis causes dehydration with loss of hydrogen chloride and potassium chloride. The hypovolemia also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, which further worsens hypokalemia and causes the paradoxical aciduria, seen in this patient, as well as a contraction alkalosis (a chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis). The initial management of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis involves intravenous fluid therapy with 0.9% NaCl to correct the extracellular volume loss and replete chloride, thereby ensuring adequate chloride delivery to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Adequate chloride delivery to the DCT is necessary for the activity of the pendrin exchanger, which reabsorbs chloride in exchange for excreting bicarbonate into the lumen of the DCT. Correction of the volume status usually also corrects any mild electrolyte disturbances, but for moderate to severe electrolyte disturbances, it may be necessary to take further measures (e.g., repletion with potassium chloride for severe hypokalemia).",

This constellation of symptoms in an exclusively breastfed infant suggests food protein-induced proctocolitis due to a non-IgE-mediated immune response to food antigens in the mother's milk. Diagnosis of this condition is clinical and management should begin with elimination of all dairy and soy products from the mother's diet. If symptoms continue, egg products should then be eliminated. Continued breastfeeding is encouraged as long as the offending proteins can be avoided. Formula-fed infants with food protein-induced proctocolitis should be switched to hydrolyzed formulas (e.g., hydrolyzed casein).\n\nRectal bleeding usually improves within 3 days of removal of the offending food antigen. Most infants will be able to tolerate reintroduction of the offending food antigen to their diet by the time they are 1 year old.",

There is no leakage of amniotic fluid. Since arrival, she has had 5 contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting 70 to 90 seconds. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervix and a uterus consistent in size with a 38-week gestation. Ultrasound shows a single live intrauterine fetus in a breech presentation consistent with a gestational age of approximately 37 weeks. The amniotic fluid index is 26 cm (N = 10–20) and the fetal heart rate is 92/min. The placenta is not detached. She is scheduled for an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean delivery because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. The infant is delivered and APGAR score is noted to be 8 at 1 minute. The physician soon notices cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa, which does not resolve when the infant cries. The infant is foaming at the mouth and drooling. He also has an intractable cough. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Infants with esophageal atresia are usually unable to swallow during the prenatal period, which results in polyhydramnios. Placement of an oroesophageal or nasoesophageal tube is used for continuous suction of secretions and prevents aspiration. Oral feeding should not be attempted. Patients with esophageal atresia should receive surgical treatment within the first 24 hours of birth.",

His mother states that he has also had difficulty feeding and opening his mouth. He has not had fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation via uncomplicated vaginal delivery at home. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. The mother refused prenatal vaccines out of concern they would cause side effects. She is worried his symptoms may be from some raw honey his older sister may have inadvertently fed him 5 days ago. He appears irritable. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F).

Tetanus is acquired in nonimmunized individuals after spores of the pathogen enter the body through broken skin. Neonatal tetanus most commonly results from unsterile management of the umbilical stump, which is more likely to occur in resource-limited regions or after home births. The tetanus vaccine is routinely administered in pregnancy, which allows the newborn to acquire passive immunity through maternal antibodies that cross the placenta and be protected until the regular tetanus vaccine (at 2 months of age) is administered. Infants born to nonimmunized patients are especially at high risk of developing neonatal tetanus.\n\nTetanus may cause respiratory muscle spasms, leading to respiratory failure. The toxin reaches the CNS via retrograde axonal transport, where it blocks the release of neurotransmitters. Because the axonal length of neurotransmitters is shorter in children than in adults, children exhibit a rapid onset of symptoms.",

The patient's older brother underwent surgery for pyloric stenosis as an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the left mid to lower sternal border. Abdominal examination shows a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen. There is no organomegaly. An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The loss of bicarbonate, sodium salts, and potassium salts of organic acids (proton acceptors) through the stool results in metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. Large-volume diarrhea can also result in marked volume depletion, which stimulates ADH secretion. Exacerbation of hyponatremia can occur, in particular, if hypotonic fluids are ingested.

Although patients with DKA have high levels of serum glucose, the glucose cannot be transported into the cells. As a result, the cells undergo fatty acid metabolism with ketone acid production for energy generation, resulting in ketoacidosis (low pH). Furthermore, sodium losses from renal diuresis secondary to hyperglycemia cause hyponatremia.",

        "explanation_why": "These values indicate hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with hyponatremia and hypokalemia, which is classically associated with persistent vomiting in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. In patients with prolonged vomiting (generally several days to a week), enough hydrochloric acid is lost from the stomach that the body can no longer compensate via renal (bicarbonate secretion) or respiratory (hypoventilation) mechanisms. As a result, chloride and hydrogen ion concentrations decrease, resulting in hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (increased pH). There are several mechanisms that can result in hypokalemia seen in such cases. For one, vomiting results in volume depletion and aldosterone secretion, which promotes renal potassium losses. In addition, hydrogen ions shift extracellularly to compensate for increased pH, while potassium ions shift intracellularly to maintain electroneutrality. The classic electrolyte pattern of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia is rarely encountered nowadays. Emesis is still the most common presenting symptom, but infants are usually diagnosed early, before significant symptoms, malnourishment, and electrolyte abnormalities develop.",

        "explanation_why": "Since RhoGAM only works in unsensitized mothers, titers of anti-D antibodies should be checked (e.g., with an indirect Coombs test) prior to administration of the medication. In the United States, guidelines recommend that all Rh-negative mothers who may potentially be carrying an Rh-positive fetus undergo anti-D antibody screening at the first prenatal visit. If the first anti-D screen shows that the mother is unsensitized, she should undergo repeat screening between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation. If the anti-D screen remains negative, RhoGAM should be administered at 28 weeks' gestation (typically a single standard dose without confirmation of the fetal blood type) and, if the newborn is Rh-positive, again within 72 hours following delivery after fetomaternal hemorrhage tests to determine the dosage.\n\nOther indications for the administration of RhoGAM include situations in which Rh-negative mothers are exposed to fetal red blood cells, e.g., invasive prenatal diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, abdominal trauma, external cephalic version, ectopic pregnancy, and bleeding during pregnancy.",

It lasted approximately 1 minute, and involved blinking and lip-smacking movements as well as left-sided jerking of the hand and foot. His mother says she measured a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F) at that time. He has had increasing difficulty feeding since yesterday. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation and weighed 3189 g (7 lb 1 oz); he currently weighs 2980 g (6 lb 9 oz). The mother's prenatal course was significant for gonorrhea infection diagnosed early in pregnancy and treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin combination therapy. The boy appears irritable and lethargic. His temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F). Examination shows clusters of vesicular lesions with an erythematous base on the patient's face and trunk.

Cesarean delivery is indicated in women with recurrent and active genital herpes at the onset of labor to reduce the risk of transmission and thereby prevent neonatal HSV, which could result in severe complications like disseminated disease or meningoencephalitis. Although oral acyclovir does not prevent vertical transmission, it will help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. In severe infection, IV acyclovir should be considered. If HSV lesions are not genital, delivery can proceed as normal. After birth, breastfeeding can also continue as usual unless lesions are on the breast.\n\nOral acyclovir can be used as suppressive therapy for genital herpes after 36 weeks' gestation until delivery in women with a prior history of genital herpes.",

He became very fussy the previous evening and cried for most of the night. He was born at 36 weeks' gestation and weighed 2430 g (5 lb 3 oz). The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The mother does not recall any sick contacts at home. He currently weighs 2776 g (6 lb 2 oz). He appears irritable. His temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 180/min, and blood pressure is 82/51 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus. He becomes more agitated when picked up. There is full range of motion of his neck and extremities. The anterior fontanelle feels soft and flat. Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities. Blood cultures are drawn and fluid resuscitation is initiated. A urinalysis obtained by catheterization shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

However, this patient does not present with features suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., coma, papilledema, focal neurologic deficit) that would prompt a CT scan.

In neonates, meningitis often manifests with nonspecific symptoms and without the classic triad of meningitis. CSF analysis can confirm the diagnosis and guide antibiotic treatment. Until the results of the CSF analysis are available, patients should be treated with empiric antibiotic therapy (e.g., ampicillin plus gentamicin and/or cefotaxime in patients < 1 month).\n\nIn patients with signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., seizures), imaging should be obtained before performing a lumbar puncture. In neonates and infants, a cranial ultrasound is usually the preferred method of neuroimaging. In older children, a CT scan should be performed. Although a bulging fontanelle can be a sign of increased intracranial pressure, it is not an indication for imaging on its own.",

These benefits are generally considered to outweigh the increased risk of developing infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) associated with the medication, which is more common in newborns < 2 weeks old. Infants should still be closely monitored for any signs of IHPS, such as nonbilious vomiting and irritability when feeding. See “Overview of neonatal conjunctivitis” table.\n\nThe CDC recommends chlamydia screening for all pregnant women < 25 years of age (and those over 25 years of age if at increased risk) and retesting during the third trimester because neither oral nor topical antibiotic therapy is effective for the prevention of CC.",

She was born via vaginal delivery at 39 weeks' gestation to a 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1. The mother had an unmedicated delivery at home; the patient did not receive any routine postpartum medications. The mother had not seen her gynecologist since her first prenatal visit. The newborn's temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 42/min, and blood pressure is 73/53 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination shows eyelid edema, conjunctival injection, and copious yellow mucopurulent discharge from the right eye. There is no corneal ulceration or evidence of keratitis. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?",

If left untreated, NGC may result in corneal scarring and blindness. After confirming NGC (using culture and Gram stain or PCR), systemic treatment with either an IV or IM third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) is indicated. In addition, the eyes should be flushed with saline until the discharge clears.",

        "explanation_why": "This combination is associated with Rhesus incompatibility, which may result in severe HDFN with hydrops fetalis because Rh antigen system expression on RBCs begins very early (during the embryonic period). In an Rh-negative mother and Rh-positive fetus, maternal exposure to fetal blood (most often during birth) leads to the production of maternal IgM antibodies against the Rh antigen. Over time, seroconversion to anti-Rh IgG antibodies occurs; these antibodies are able to cross the placenta in following pregnancies. In a subsequent pregnancy with another Rh-positive child, maternal anti-Rh IgG antibodies bind to the Rh antigen of fetal RBCs, marking them for destruction and resulting in HDFN. The first child of this patient's mother must have been Rh-positive.\n\nSince Rh incompatibility may be fatal, anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis is administered to Rh-negative pregnant women during the 28^th week of gestation of their first pregnancy. However, the mother of this patient did not receive any prenatal care and she most likely did not receive anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis in her first pregnancy.",

This preterm infant has no indications that would delay the DTaP vaccine, such as uncontrolled seizures or nervous system disease, and can receive the vaccine at 2 months of chronological age.\n\nNote that the Hepatitis B vaccine would be given before the DTaP vaccine but not immediately after birth, which is the standard immunization schedule for term newborns > 2000 g of birth weight. Infants with low birth weight have weak production of protective anti-HBs antibodies, so newborns < 2000 g should receive their first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine at 1 month of age (regardless of weight at that time) or upon discharge from the hospital, whichever comes sooner. All other vaccines are administered according to the standard immunization schedule, taking the infant's chronological age into account, irrespective of prematurity.",

According to the CDC, the hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as a 3-dose regimen, with the first dose administered at birth, the second dose at 1–2 months, and the third dose at 6–18 months of age in children whose mothers are HbsAg-negative, such as this newborn's fully-immunized mother. However, infants with low birth weight have weak production of protective anti-HBs antibodies, so newborns < 2000 g should receive their first dose at 1 month of age (regardless of weight at that time) or upon discharge from the hospital, whichever comes sooner. This newborn currently weighs 1550-g (3.3-lb), so hepatitis B vaccine administration would not be recommended at this time.",

A common risk factor is premature rupture of membranes (PROM), as evidenced by the gush of pale yellow fluid prior to the onset of labor in this patient's mother.\n\nRoutine screening for maternal GBS colonization is performed by rectal or vaginal swab cultures from 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks' gestation. Treatment with intrapartum penicillin G or ampicillin is indicated in birthing parents with positive screening, GBS bacteriuria, history of GBS infection, or risk factors (e.g., PROM, fever, preterm labor).

The lack of routine prenatal care puts this neonate at risk for congenital viral infections but this neonate has no other evidence of these infections (e.g., low birth weight, rash, hepatosplenomegaly). Patients with congenital parvovirus B19 infection can develop anemia as a result of red cell aplasia but these patients present with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of hemolysis. While a congenital viral infection cannot be ruled out definitively, the overall presentation and laboratory findings make another diagnosis more likely.",

        "explanation_why": "ABO incompatibility is a relatively common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDFN) affecting approx. 20% of all pregnancies and can occur even during the first pregnancy. ABO incompatibility most commonly occurs in neonates with blood groups A or B born to mothers with blood group O. Mothers with blood group O often have anti-B and anti-A antibodies even if no prior sensitization has occurred. While most of these antibodies are of the IgM isotype, which cannot pass the placenta, some are IgG antibodies, which can enter into fetal circulation during pregnancy. Since fetal RBCs do not fully express antigens A and B, these IgG antibodies only cause mild hemolysis and the direct Coombs test is usually negative or only weakly positive. Evidence of hemolysis is apparent within the first 24 hours after birth. Patients with HDFN due to ABO incompatibility do not develop hydrops fetalis or kernicterus.\n\nSee “ABO vs. Rh incompatibility” table.",

She was born at term to a 26-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2. Pregnancy was complicated by a breech presentation for which she underwent an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean section. The newborn's head circumference is 35 cm (13.7 in). She is at the 60th percentile for length and 75th percentile for weight. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The spine is normal. Abduction of the right hip after cupping the pelvis and flexing the right hip and knee causes a palpable clunk. The feet have no deformities. Ultrasonography of the hip determines the angle between lines along the bone acetabulum and the ilium is 50°. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This newborn has a positive Ortolani sign (the clunk heard and felt on abducting her flexed hip), which suggests developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The sex of the child (female) and a breech presentation are risk factors for DDH. An alpha angle (angle between lines along the bone acetabulum and the ilium) of less than 60° on ultrasound also indicates DDH.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "In most infants, mild hip instability (e.g., the femoral head is subluxable) resolves spontaneously within the first 6–8 weeks of life, as growth of the femoral head and acetabulum reduces hip laxity. If mild hip instability is detected at neonatal screening, close observation, and repeat examination after 2–6 weeks are appropriate. However, in infants with clinical evidence of hip instability (e.g., the femoral head is dislocatable) and abnormal ultrasound findings, DDH is unlikely to resolve without treatment. These infants are at high risk of developing a functional disability and accelerated osteoarthritis in the course of their lives. Expectant management would therefore not be appropriate.",

A hip x-ray would be appropriate (instead of an ultrasound) if the child were older than 4 months.",

Therefore, further maneuvers to reduce the hip are not needed. In infants with DDH older than 6 months, contractures develop around the hip joint and make hip abduction difficult. Closed reduction of the hip joint under general anesthesia would be indicated in such a scenario.",

The harness should be worn for at least 23 hours/day for 6–8 weeks. The type of abduction harness (rigid vs. nonrigid harness) used varies by region and institutional protocols.\n\nNonrigid harnesses (e.g., the Pavlik harness) are the most commonly used orthotic among patients with DDH, although recent evidence suggests rigid harnesses (e.g., von Rosen harness) are associated with better outcomes.",

Congenital rubella syndrome usually only results if the infection occurs during organogenesis, i.e., during the first 1–8 weeks of gestation. If the transmission occurs after 16 weeks' gestation, the risk of developing congenital rubella syndrome is extremely low.\n\nThere are different laboratory studies available to confirm the diagnosis of congenital rubella infection: PCR for rubella RNA, viral culture (both tests may be performed from nasal, throat, or blood specimens from the newborn), or serology (rubella-specific IgM or IgG antibodies in abnormally high or persistent concentrations).",

According to his mother, the boy was running in the yard when he fell and injured his right arm. The boy is crying and clutching his arm. During the past year, he has been brought in 4 other times for extremity pain following falls, all of which have been diagnosed as long bone fractures. He is at the 10^th percentile for height and 25^th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 97/68 mm Hg. His right forearm is diffusely erythematous. The patient withdraws and yells when his forearm is touched. His left arm has two small ecchymotic regions overlying the elbow and wrist. A photograph of his eyes is shown. An x-ray of the right forearm shows a transverse mid-ulnar fracture with diffusely decreased bone density. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Echocardiography findings are consistent with the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA): In TGA, the systemic circulation is disconnected from pulmonary circulation and venous blood that is received by the right ventricle is pumped to the rest of the body without being oxygenated.

        "explanation_why": "TGA results in rapidly worsening hypoxemia and cyanosis shortly after birth, and relies on a patent ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is kept patent in fetal circulation by the effect of low partial pressure of oxygen in fetal circulation, as well as by endogenously produced prostaglandin E. After birth, the ductus arteriosus begins to close in response to an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen. Intravenously administered prostaglandin E1 keeps the ductus arteriosus open and allows mixing of blood between the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This effect is crucial for initial survival of infants with TGA because it is the only way to maintain oxygenation of the arterial blood until surgical repair can be performed.",

    "question_text": "A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but he often spits up or refuses to eat. He has not had a cough, fever, or bloody stools. The patient was born at term by cesarean delivery and had his first bowel movement 2 days after delivery. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50^th percentile for length, 10^th percentile for weight, and 40^th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "correct_answer": "F",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This newborn has features of Down syndrome and was noted at birth to have late passage of meconium, which raises concern for Hirschsprung disease (HD). The current symptoms of poor feeding and bilious vomiting, physical findings of abdominal distention and explosive stool release upon rectal examination, and the presence of a dilated colonic segment proximal to an empty segment on x-ray further support this diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "In adults, a CT scan of the abdomen is a common diagnostic test for patients with acute abdominal pain or severe abdominal distention. However, in children in general and even more so in newborns such as this boy at 3 weeks of age, CT scans should be avoided whenever possible because of the exposure to ionizing radiation and the significant risk of long-term complications (e.g., radiation-related cancers). Alternative imaging techniques such as ultrasonography and/or MRI are almost always preferred. Abdominal CT scans are not indicated for the diagnostic workup of HD.",

While findings on abdominal ultrasonography may support the diagnosis (e.g., dilated colonic segments), given its poor positive predictive value, ultrasound does not play an important role in the diagnosis of HD.

Barium enema is also useful for excluding HD in patients with a low clinical suspicion of the disease.

However, because the developing anorectal sphincter does not reach a stable resting pressure until approx. 1 month of age, anorectal manometry is not the best diagnostic test for this 3-week-old patient. In addition, accurate evaluation in anorectal manometry requires precise placement of sensors, which is challenging with a newborn patient.",

Approx.10% of children with CF have meconium ileus, which manifests with delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distention, and possibly bilious vomiting.

It can be performed either as a full-thickness biopsy, carried out under general anesthesia, or as a rectal suction biopsy, directly at the bedside, sparing the patient the need to undergo general anesthesia. If the biopsy shows an absence of ganglion cells in an adequate tissue sample, HD is confirmed. A normal biopsy result taken from a correct site (i.e., 2 cm proximal to the dentate line) virtually rules out HD.\n\nIf HD is confirmed, the aganglionic segment of the colon is resected and anastomosed, either in a one-stage operation or, less commonly, as a two-stage surgery in which a diverting colostomy is performed to decompress the dilated bowel, followed by definitive anastomosis of the bowel loops.",

Bag-mask ventilation is contraindicated as air is pumped into the stomach and the bowel, resulting in gastric and/or intestinal distention and further compression of the lung. As in this patient, the majority (approximately 85%) of CDH cases are left-sided.\n\nFollowing intubation, a nasogastric tube should be placed for gastric decompression to decompress the stomach/bowel and reduce lung compression.",

Congenital meatal stenosis, which is caused by failed regression of the distal urethral membrane, may manifest in neonates with signs of urinary obstruction, such as this patient's palpable bladder on physical examination and his history of oligohydramnios. However, meatal stenosis is most frequently acquired (e.g., secondary to circumcision) rather than congenital, making this diagnosis less likely.",

A PUV is present in about 1/4,000 live births, making it the most common cause of UTO in newborn boys. The treatment of choice is cystoscopy with primary valve ablation.\n\nThe presence of PUV can be detected via prenatal ultrasound, which usually shows a distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, hydronephrosis with marked vesicoureteral reflux, and megaureter, as well as oligohydramnios. In severe cases, the deficiency of amniotic fluid may lead to the development of the Potter sequence: pulmonary hypoplasia, craniofacial abnormalities, and limb anomalies.",

Menarche occurred at the age of 11 years, and menses occurred at 30- to 40-day intervals until pregnancy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 3-cm, firm, nontender, nonmobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. Ultrasound and ultrasound-guided core biopsy confirm an infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The pathological specimen is positive for estrogen and ERBB2 receptors and negative for progesterone receptors. Staging shows no distant metastatic disease. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Because her tumor is 3 cm, this patient is considered high risk and should therefore undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. Certain chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil) have a low risk profile and can be used in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Chemotherapy should be discontinued 3–4 weeks before delivery to reduce the risk of complications (e.g., transient neonatal myelosuppression, bleeding, sepsis) during childbirth and in the postpartum period.\n\nA 3–6 month delay in chemotherapy is associated with less favorable outcomes in nonpregnant individuals. Therefore, physicians should counsel patients through open communication and shared decision-making, according to their individual treatment needs. Patients have the right to refuse chemotherapy and/or delay treatment until after delivery.",

She reports that the episodes are worse when he is agitated and better when he sleeps in supine position. During this period he has had frequent regurgitation of his feeds. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation. The neonatal period was complicated by transient tachypnea. His immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 160/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 94/56 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Physical examination shows subcostal retractions. Stridor and diffuse wheezing are heard in the thorax. Anteroposterior and lateral x-rays of the chest show anterior tracheal bowing and narrowing. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

However, it may also appear in other conditions (e.g., bacterial tracheitis, tumors). An accompanying lateral radiograph might additionally show inspiratory overdistention of the hypopharynx.",

        "explanation_why": "Fetal hydantoin syndrome is a collection of defects associated with maternal exposure to phenytoin and other hydantoins (e.g., fosphenytoin). Use of these medications interferes with folate metabolism which often induces a deficiency. Common features of fetal hydantoin syndrome include intrauterine growth restriction, craniofacial abnormalities (e.g., cleft palate, hypertelorism, slanted palpebral fissures, and low-set ears), a short neck, limb defects (phalanx/fingernail hypoplasia), and excessive hair on the body and face. Other manifestations include cardiac anomalies (e.g., ventricular septal defect), ocular defects, hypospadias, and umbilical and inguinal hernias. Treatment is largely supportive and includes surgery to fix the cleft palate in addition to special education.\n\nFetal hydantoin syndrome does not typically manifest with neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida), which are usually seen in other types of folate deficiency and may occur as a result of maternal use of other anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or valproate (see “Overview of antiepileptics to avoid during pregnancy” table).",

        "explanation_why": "Spinal muscular atrophy is a possible cause of muscular hypotonia in infants. The most severe type (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) may manifest immediately after birth or up to 6 months of age. Proximal muscles, mostly of the lower extremities, are usually involved symmetrically. However, seizures, a tense anterior fontanelle, impaired pupillary response, and roving eye movements would not be consistent with this diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "While most patients are asymptomatic at birth, half of the patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have seizures with cerebral foci, a lag of psychomotor development, and a musty body odor by 4–6 months of age. Additional features include light, pale hair and blue eyes (due to decreased melanin production). Since most patients are asymptomatic until severe and often irreversible complications have occurred, direct measurement of phenylalanine levels is an important part of newborn screening for metabolic disorders. The screening test is performed on the second day after birth using blood obtained from a heel prick.",

However, elevated intracranial pressure usually manifests with rapidly increasing circumference of the head in neonates, which is not seen in this infant. Furthermore, instead of the roving eye movements, a downward deviation of the eyes (sunset eye sign) would be expected in patients with hydrocephalus.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication in preterm infants and usually occurs within the first five days after birth. This complication is typically seen in neonates of < 1500 g birth weight and born before 32 weeks' gestation due to the fragility of the germinal matrix. Additional risk factors include peripartal chorioamnionitis and hypoxia (as suggested by this patient's low Apgar scores). Most infants with IVH are asymptomatic, but saltatory (over several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible. Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, bulging anterior fontanelle, and neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures, cranial nerve abnormalities as suggested by poor pupillary light reflexes and roving eye movements), all of which this patient has.\n\nCranial ultrasonography is the preferred method to diagnose IVH in newborns. Since most patients are asymptomatic, screening ultrasounds are routinely performed in infants with a birth weight < 1500 g and delivery before 30 weeks' gestation.",

In addition, the choroid plexus is clearly demarcated (blue overlay). Together, these findings are consistent with grade 2 IVH.\nThe third column shows blood occupying more than 50% of the lateral ventricles (red overlay) with enlargement of the cavum septi pellucidi (green overlay) and both lateral ventricles (yellow overlay). This appearance is consistent with grade 3 IVH.These features suggest impaired progressive posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) due to associated impairment of CSF circulation, which is a potential complication of high-grade IVH.",

The severe manifestations of galactosemia are a direct result of these toxic metabolites. Infantile cataracts are caused by the accumulation of galactitol in the eye lens. Newborns typically become symptomatic after the initiation of breastfeeding or formula feeding. The condition can be diagnosed by the presence of increased levels of galactose in the urine or increased levels of galactose-1-phosphate in the blood. Patients with classic galactosemia must avoid food containing lactose (e.g., cow's milk, breast milk).",

While tracheomalacia can also cause respiratory distress, this patient's presentation is not consistent with the wheezing and stridor typically seen with tracheomalacia. Moreover, the reported oxygen saturation of 91% on 40% oxygen represents significant hypoxemia; it would be unusual for tracheomalacia alone to cause this degree of desaturation. Also, tracheomalacia would not explain this patient's x-ray findings.",

This neonate demonstrates the classic presentation of BPD, which includes persistent tachypnea, labored breathing (intercostal and subcostal retractions), the need for oxygen supplementation to maintain a peripheral saturation ≥ 90% at ≥ 28 days of postnatal age, and diffuse granular densities with basal atelectasis on x-ray. Later in the disease course, interspersed cystic areas and diffuse hyperinflation of the lung can develop. Treatment of BPD primarily focuses on limiting oxygen toxicity and preventing complications (specifically pneumothorax, cardiovascular collapse, and neonatal sepsis).",

In these severe cases, complications such as pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax are sometimes present.

Other characteristic symptoms include chorioretinitis, sensorineural hearing loss, petechiae, and purpura (blueberry muffin rash). The risk of CMV transmission increases throughout pregnancy, whereas the risk of congenital defects is highest if the fetus is infected in the first trimester.

He was born at 38 weeks' gestation following spontaneous vaginal delivery. His mother received no prenatal care. He was 51 cm (20 in) in length and weighed 3660 g (8 lb 1 oz) at birth. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Examination following delivery showed no abnormalities, and he was discharged at the age of 2 days. Today, he is at the 20th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 190/min, respirations are 60/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96% and breathing appears labored. Examination shows no cyanosis, but a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the left lower sternal border. ECG shows left-axis deviation. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged left atrium and ventricle and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Doppler echocardiography confirms the presence of an intracardiac shunt. The development of this patient's current symptoms is most likely a result of which of the following?",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "Heart failure manifests with dyspnea, easy fatigability, and in children, sweating while feeding and failure to thrive. A faint holosystolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border is consistent with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high in utero and decreases over the first few weeks of life. The progressive decrease in PVR and subsequent decrease in right ventricular pressure lead to increased left-to-right blood flow across the VSD. The enhanced shunting increases the overall volume of blood in pulmonary circulation, which causes increased lung perfusion (as evidenced by increased pulmonary vascular markings), increased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium, and left ventricular volume overload (resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy as evidenced on this patient's ECG and chest x-ray). These changes can lead to heart failure without cyanosis within the first few weeks to months of life, as seen in this child.\n\nIf the VSD is not repaired and pulmonary blood flow continues to be high, vascular remodeling in later stages will cause PVR to increase again, resulting first in right ventricular hypertrophy and persistent pulmonary hypertension and, eventually, shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome) resulting in heart failure with cyanosis.",

            "description": "A defect in the ventricular septum leads to a left-to-right shunt, the volume of which is dependent on the size of the defect. Blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (white arrow) along the pressure gradient (1). This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

        "explanation_why": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension in a patient with a VSD (which is initially a left-to-right shunt) could cause a shunt reversal (Eisenmenger reaction). However, Eisenmenger reaction is associated with cyanosis and right ventricular hypertrophy, and typically only occurs after a left-to-right shunt has persisted for an extended amount of time. The patient's age and the presence of only left ventricular hypertrophy indicate that the heart failure is triggered by a physiological adaptation that occurs during the first few weeks of life.",

However, a murmur due to LVOTO typically has a systolic ejection character and is usually heard at the upper sternal borders (with possible radiation to the carotid region) or the interscapular region.

There is a keyhole-shaped defect in the iris of the left eye. He has seven fingers on each hand. There is an opening in the roof of the mouth extending into the soft and hard palate bilaterally. A 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the left lower sternal border. The heels are prominent, with convex-shaped deformity of the plantar surface of the feet. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?",

The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol use disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

Additionally, DiGeorge syndrome is associated with a variety of cardiac defects, including the otherwise rare truncus arteriosus defect (single overriding vessel seen on echocardiography). DiGeorge syndrome also involves impaired development of the parathyroid glands, leading to hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia, which may lead to tetany and seizures during infancy.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD) and causes a holosystolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border. Small VSDs (diameter ≤ 3 mm) cause less left-to-right shunting but result in louder murmurs when compared to medium or large VSDs.",

However, Doppler echocardiography has largely replaced catheterization in the initial workup of VSD, as it provides almost all of the same information without the associated risks of an invasive procedure.\n\nIn a patient with a VSD, cardiac catheterization would be indicated prior to surgical repair if pulmonary hypertension were suspected based on clinical (e.g., loud P_2) or echocardiographic findings.

RVH is a compensatory mechanism against the outflow tract obstruction, which helps to reduce cyanosis by increasing flow through the stenotic pulmonary vasculature so that deoxygenated blood does not flow through the VSD and into the systemic circulation. However, RVH can only compensate to a small degree to improve normal circulatory flow and is, therefore, only a minor determinant of cyanosis.",

        "explanation_why": "In patients with TOF, the right ventricular (RV) outflow obstruction due to central pulmonary valve stenosis and hypoplasia determines the severity of cyanosis and the intensity of the systolic heart murmur. Blood preferentially flows via the path of least resistance. When there is a high degree of RV outflow obstruction, blood will flow through the VSD instead of through the pulmonary artery for oxygenation in the lungs. As a result, deoxygenated blood will enter the left ventricle via the VSD and be pumped into the aorta and systemic circulation. If there is minimal RV outflow obstruction, blood will flow through the pulmonary vasculature, and become oxygenated before reaching the left ventricle, resulting in a reduction of cyanosis. In TOF, the single S_2 can result from an attenuated pulmonary component (P_2) that is often not heard on auscultation.\n\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during spells of hypoxia, which relieves symptoms by increasing systemic vascular resistance and, in turn, left ventricular outflow resistance. This creates higher left ventricular pressures, so that blood in the right ventricle will be directed through the pulmonary vasculature rather than the VSD. The increased blood flow across the RV outflow obstruction during squatting is also associated with an increased intensity of the ejection murmur.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In TVA, blood is unable to pass from the right atrium (RA) to the right ventricle (RV). Consequently, the RV is almost always hypoplastic. Venous blood, therefore, passes from the RA via an atrial septal defect (which, under these circumstances, is essential for survival) to the left atrium, where it mixes with oxygenated blood from the lungs. The mixed blood is pumped from the left ventricle (LV) into the systemic circulation (resulting in cyanosis) and pulmonary circulation (via a patent ductus arteriosus). LV hypertrophy occurs because the LV is single-handedly pumping blood through both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. A combination of RV hypoplasia and LV hypertrophy results in a severe left-axis deviation. Other findings that may be present on ECG include tall P waves (due to right atrial enlargement) and small R waves in the right precordial leads (e.g., V1, V2).\n\nThe majority of patients with TVA also have a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and concomitant pulmonary outflow obstruction. The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border arises from a VSD. In a patient with TVA, a single S_2 that does not split with respiration indicates severely limited blood flow across the pulmonary valve and/or severe pulmonary stenosis. The systolic murmur of a VSD is softer with increasing severity of pulmonary stenosis and/or increasing size of the defect, because both result in a decreased pressure gradient across the VSD. Prostaglandin-E1 is given to maintain PDA patency (thereby increasing pulmonary circulation and blood oxygenation), but definitive treatment is staged surgical repair.",

        "explanation_why": "Pulmonary vascular congestion seen on chest x-ray is a sign of left heart failure, with subsequent “backing up” of blood into the pulmonary vasculature, leading to enlarged pulmonary vessels. Although this finding is classically associated with congestive heart failure in adults (especially in older individuals), some congenital cardiac defects can also cause this finding (e.g., truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return). In TOF (the most likely diagnosis in this case), there is a right ventricular outflow obstruction, leading to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary vasculature. Chest x-ray would more likely show decreased pulmonary vascular markings and a classic boot-shaped heart.",

In patent ductus arteriosus, this can be compensated by a right-to-left-shunt of blood from the pulmonary arteries into the aorta, resulting in the flow of mixed blood with decreased oxygen saturation (↓ SaO_2) to the general circulation.(2) After closure of the ductus arteriosus, the right-to-left shunt is absent (~ SaO_2) and there is hypoperfusion (↓ BP) of the abdominal organs and lower extremities with oxygenated blood.",

        "explanation_why": "Right axis deviation on ECG is typically seen in patients with TOF due to right ventricular hypertrophy. The thickened myocardium in the right ventricle produces increased electrical activity, which shifts the axis of cardiac depolarization. TOF also involves an overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis. It is the most common congenital cyanotic heart lesion. In addition to these ECG findings, a chest x-ray showing a boot-shaped heart also supports the diagnosis. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis.",

With mild obstruction (1), a left-to-right shunt is more pronounced and there is mild cyanosis. With severe obstruction (2), a right-to-left shunt is more pronounced, which results in severe cyanosis. Pulmonary circulation may be supplied via a patent ductus arteriosus.",

        "explanation_why": "A machine-like murmur over the heart is pathognomonic for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is usually an acyanotic congenital condition because most blood passes through normal circulation and thus sufficient oxygen saturation is maintained; only a small amount of blood is pumped through the PDA. Symptoms can vary depending on the degree of patency but may include tachycardia, tachypnea, and poor growth. The infant described here is lagging behind in terms of weight gain, but vital signs are within the normal range for a 5-month old infant (HR 80–160/min, RR 30–60/min). Finally, PDA causes continuous symptoms, as opposed to the episodic symptoms described for this patient.",

This shunt leads to volume overload (recirculation) of the blood within the pulmonary vessels, the left atrium, and left ventricle (2). Eventually, because of the increased blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, pulmonary hypertension may develop as well as Eisenmenger syndrome, which involves a shunt reversal. The left-to-right-shunt without cyanosis becomes a right-to-left shunt with cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Pink: structures that contain mixed blood",

    "hint": "Cyanosis shortly after birth that does not improve with supplemental oxygen and a chest x-ray with the classic egg-on-a-string appearance (i.e., an enlarged heart with narrowed mediastinum due to an overlapping aorta and pulmonary trunk) are suggestive of a diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The holosystolic murmur indicates a coexistent ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is critical for life, as it allows for the mixing of oxygenated blood and its entry into the systemic circulation, especially after ductus arteriosus closure.",

The remaining ventricle is small and hypocontractile.

Blood flows through the patent foramen ovale or (commonly associated) atrial septal defect from the right atrium to the left atrium (right-to-left shunt) and then via the left ventricle into the circulation, resulting in pronounced cyanosis. The pulmonary circulation system may also be perfused through blood from the aorta (via the ductus arteriosus).",

There is swelling over the right parietal bone with boundaries limited to the cranial suture lines. The liver is palpated 1 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 17 g/dL Reticulocyte count 0.5% Serum Bilirubin, total 21.2 mg/dL Direct 2 mg/dL Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "An increased frequency of breastfeeds is recommended in the management of breastfeeding jaundice. In this condition, the lack of calories due to insufficient breast milk intake and subsequently reduced bowel movements lead to a failure to excrete bilirubin, thereby increasing the enterohepatic circulation and reabsorption of bilirubin from the intestines. Jaundice usually develops within the first week. Since this infant is exclusively breastfed without showing signs of weight loss, breastfeeding jaundice is unlikely. Moreover, his high bilirubin levels demand prompt intervention to prevent complications.",

In this condition, elevated concentrations of β-glucuronidase in breast milk lead to increased deconjugation and reabsorption of bilirubin, thereby causing hyperbilirubinemia. Clinically, jaundice manifests ∼ 1–2 weeks after birth with a simultaneous peak in bilirubin levels, which is unlikely to have developed yet in this 3-day-old newborn.

Since this newborn has a bilirubin level of 21.2 mg/dL, intervention is indicated.

In a 3-day-old term newborn who is medically well and lacks certain risk factors (e.g., lethargy, G6PD deficiency, isoimmune hemolytic disease), this threshold is at ≥ 18 mg/dL. If treatment is not initiated swiftly, the risk of neurotoxic damage (e.g., kernicterus) due to hyperbilirubinemia increases.\n\nExclusively breastfed newborns are at increased risk of developing neonatal jaundice.

Because of its low false-positive rate for Down syndrome, cffDNA testing is commonly used as a secondary screening test in patients at high risk (e.g., maternal age ≥ 35 years, abnormal first-trimester screening results) in order to avoid invasive procedures. However, cffDNA testing is not diagnostic and fetal chromosomal analysis using an invasive test is still required to confirm Down syndrome.",

Jaundice is also present.This appearance is termed “blueberry muffin syndrome.” Differential diagnoses include hematological disorders, other malignancies, and congenital infections (the jaundice in this case may be related to the underlying AML but is not part of the blueberry muffin appearance itself).",

It is possible for infants with restricted diets (i.e., feeding exclusively with goat milk, which is deficient in folic acid) or malabsorption issues to develop folate deficiency with anemia. However, folate deficiency would not explain this patient's dysmorphic features.\n\nHypersegmented neutrophils are also present in vitamin B_12 deficiency, which can additionally manifest with neurological manifestations.",

If the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein is defective, viscous mucus obstructs the formation of the vas deferens during the development of the genital tract. This obstruction results in the congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens in ∼ 98% of male individuals with CF, leading to infertility. Additionally, individuals with CF may have a decreased sperm count, which supports the theory that CFTR might also play a direct role in sperm maturation and development. However, spermatogenesis may be intact and individuals with CF can still have children via sperm retrieval and in vitro fertilization.",

This newborn has an impaired respiratory effort (as indicated by his irregular respiratory rate), but there is no history of the mother having used narcotic analgesics. Moreover, the treatment is no longer recommended because of unclear efficacy. Regardless, a different step is more important in correcting hypoxia and would take priority.",

Neonatal hyperinsulinism can cause hypoglycemia, which may manifest with jitteriness, poor feeding, respiratory distress, and neonatal polycythemia. However, this patient's mother does not have a history of diabetes mellitus, making hyperinsulinism unlikely.

        "explanation_why": "Contacting child protective services is mandatory if abuse of any kind is suspected. Sexually abused children typically present with injuries in the genital, anal, and oral areas, recurrent urinary tract infections, and sexually transmitted infections that may cause bloody vaginal discharge. The perpetrator is most commonly a male that is familiar with the child (e.g., father, uncle, neighbor). Multiple hematomas, multiple fractures at various stages of healing, and injuries that do not correlate with patient history should raise suspicion for physical abuse. While symptoms such as red, swollen labia, blood-tinged vaginal discharge, and hematomas should raise suspicions of child abuse, closer examination will reveal that, in this patient, the vaginal discharge is most likely due to a physiological process and the flat gray-blue patches on her back and buttocks are in fact due to a benign skin condition. Another course of action is therefore indicated.",

        "explanation_why": "The findings in this patient are common, benign neonatal conditions that do not require treatment. Blood-tinged, mucoid vaginal discharge, breast bud development, and labial swelling are all effects of intrauterine estrogen exposure. Withdrawal bleeding occurs 1–2 weeks after delivery and is self-limiting. Labial swelling also recedes after a few days. Breast bud development (and even some milky discharge) is physiological in infants of either sex. The patches on this patient's back are congenital dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spots), which typically resolve within a few years. Because congenital dermal melanocytosis may resemble hematomas, they are often mistaken for signs of child abuse.",

Patients with congenital gonorrhea and/or chlamydia typically present with eye discharge and conjunctivitis that can lead to visual impairment if left untreated. Although the pregnancy was complicated by maternal gonococcal infection, antibiotic treatment likely resolved the infection. Moreover, vaginal discharge in gonorrhea is purulent rather than mucoid. Finally, doxycycline should be avoided in children aged < 8 years because it forms complexes with calcium ions, thereby causing tooth discoloration and inhibited bone growth. Chlamydial infection in newborns is treated with oral erythromycin instead.",

In such cases, leuprolide decreases estrogen levels and suppresses sexual maturation. This patient has only mild breast development and scant vaginal bleeding that is more likely due to exposure to intrauterine maternal estrogen. If breast development or vaginal bleeding were more significant, a hormonal abnormality should be suspected. However, precocious puberty is very rare in infants and more commonly is seen in young children. Moreover, the use of leuprolide in children under 2 years is not recommended.",

Patients with congenital gonorrhea typically present with purulent conjunctivitis (gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum) 2–7 days after birth. This condition can lead to visual impairment if left untreated. Less commonly, localized infection of the pharynx, vagina, urethra, and/or anus or disseminated gonococcal infection occur. Although the pregnancy was complicated by maternal gonococcal infection, the infection was treated by antibiotics and should have resolved. Moreover, vaginal discharge in gonorrhea is not odorless and mucoid, but purulent, yellow-green, and malodorous.",

Brain lesions that involve the hypothalamus/pituitary region (e.g., sellar and/or suprasellar tumors) may result in premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and thus cause central precocious puberty. The development of sexual characteristics before one year of age is very rare. While this patient's mild breast bud development, swollen labia, and blood-tinged vaginal discharge are hormonally-mediated, they are much less severe than would be expected in precocious puberty.",

The contractions last 40 seconds each, occur every 2 minutes, and have been increasing in intensity. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. There is clear fluid in the vulva and the introitus. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows polyhydramnios, a median cleft lip, and fused thalami. The corpus callosum, 3^rd ventricle, and lateral ventricles are absent. There is a four-chamber heart. The spine shows no abnormalities.

Multiple dilated bowel loops (B) may alternatively be seen in jejunal atresia, and the number of loops may increase in conjunction with a more distal location of the atresia.1: gastric air-fluid level; 2: duodenal air-fluid level; 3: jejunal air-fluid level",

This patient is still within the expected time frame for meconium passage and his gasless distal abdomen on x-ray suggests a bowel obstruction more proximal than the rectosigmoid colon, as dilated loops of the large bowel would be expected in Hirschsprung disease.",

Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and male gender are risk factors for the development of IHPS. However, the emesis is non-bilious and projectile and will not present until the pylorus has had time to hypertrophy several weeks after birth. A palpable, olive-shaped mass is also usually present, and abdominal x-ray will show distention of the stomach only. This infant's bilious emesis, age, and triple bubble sign suggest another diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Gastroschisis is a congenital ventral wall defect that is usually isolated. By contrast, omphalocele is commonly associated with structural abnormalities of extraintestinal organs (e.g., heart, neural tube) and often occurs in the context of syndrome complexes (e.g., chromosomal trisomies, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome). In gastroschisis, the absence of a hernia sac results in an edematous, erythematous, and dull intestinal wall. This condition is mainly seen in premature infants and those with intrauterine growth restriction, and can be associated with cryptorchidism, gastrointestinal stenoses, and atresia, the latter of which can result in short bowel syndrome. Because gastroschisis is not covered by a hernia sac, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) can diffuse freely into the amniotic fluid and maternal circulation, leading to elevated MSAFP, which can be detected by a screening test.",

            "description": "Omphalocele: herniation of intraabdominal contents through an anterior abdominal wall defect at the base of the umbilical cord caused by the failure of the midgut to return to the abdominal cavity after its physiological herniation through the umbilical ring. Accordingly, the hernial sac is formed by the amniotic membrane and peritoneum, and the umbilical cord lies at the apex of the hernia.Gastroschisis: a developmental defect of the anterior abdominal wall in the paraumbilical region through which intraabdominal contents prolapse. As it is the anterior abdominal wall that fails to develop correctly, there is no outer peritoneal or membranous covering.Congenital umbilical hernia: herniation of intraabdominal contents through a patent umbilical orifice, which typically closes by 2 years of age. The sac of a paraumbilical hernia is the peritoneum.Diastasis recti: an abnormally wide separation of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles. The abdominal fascia are intact. There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up).",

In hyperkalemic patients, calcium gluconate is used as a cardioprotective agent that stabilizes the cell membrane of cardiac myocytes to decrease the likelihood of arrhythmia. Patients with hypocalcemia benefit from direct elevation of serum calcium. Although both hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia can cause weakness, the patient's physical examination strongly suggests an underlying genetic condition.",

This patient has some features consistent with hypothyroidism, especially umbilical hernia and macroglossia. However, the presence of other abnormalities, such as hemihypertrophy, hepatomegaly, and midface hypoplasia, is not consistent with congenital hypothyroidism. Most importantly, deficiency of thyroxine is very unlikely to produce an acute change in health, as seen in this patient.",

This patient has no history of significant volume loss. Moreover, the presentation of hyponatremia in neonates can be quite variable, with only the most extreme presentations requiring hypertonic (3%) saline. In these cases, patients appear acutely ill and often present with seizures, altered sensorium, and possibly coma. Given the lack of severe neurological dysfunction (e.g., seizure or coma), it is unlikely that this patient is suffering from severe hyponatremia.",

In this patient, poor feeding likely further exacerbated the effects of hyperinsulinemia, ultimately resulting in signs of hypoglycemia such as weak cry, diminished muscle tone, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and tremor. Normalizing blood sugar levels through prompt administration of glucose should alleviate these abnormalities.\n\nPatients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at increased risk of developing nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and adrenal tumors; serial screening with abdominal ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein levels is recommended.",

The newborn appears pale. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 180/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Examination in the delivery room shows midfacial hypoplasia, infraorbital creases, and a large tongue. The right side of the body is larger than the left. Abdominal examination shows that the abdominal viscera protrudes through the abdominal wall at the umbilicus; the viscera are covered by the amniotic membrane and the peritoneum. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 48 mg/dL. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows enlarged kidneys bilaterally. In addition to surgical closure of the abdominal wall, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Additionally, serum α-fetoprotein levels should also be measured every 2–3 months until 4 years of age to screen for hepatoblastoma.

Hydrocortisone replaces deficient cortisol and thereby decreases ACTH levels to reduce adrenal hyperandrogenism that contributes to virilization in females (e.g., clitoromegaly). Fludrocortisone replaces aldosterone to raise blood pressure and correct electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis).\n\nSince the adrenal glands cannot appropriately titrate corticosteroid levels, the dose of hydrocortisone must be increased during periods of stress (e.g., illness). Otherwise, patients may have an adrenal crisis.",

Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother, a 23-year-old primigravid woman, smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily during her pregnancy. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus. The newborn's temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 155/min; and respirations are 72/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Grunting and mild intercostal and subcostal retractions are present. Diffuse crackles are heard on auscultation of the chest. An x-ray of the chest shows increased lung volume and fluid within the interlobar fissures. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "TTN is a benign condition that can occur up to 2 hours after delivery and usually resolves without complications within 72 hours. Therapy consists of supportive care, including providing supplemental oxygen by hood or nasal cannula (with a goal O_2 saturation of ≥ 90 %), maintaining a neutral thermal environment, and providing adequate nutrition. TTN rarely requires a higher level of care; however, nasal continuous positive airway pressure should be initiated if the required inspired O_2 concentration is > 40 %, or if the newborn stays tachypneic with increased work of breathing despite other supplemental O_2 delivery methods. Finally, other causes of respiratory distress (e.g., pneumonia, neonatal sepsis, congenital heart condition) should be excluded.\n\nTTN is caused by delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid and most commonly occurs after cesarean delivery, which does not allow fluid to be squeezed out of the neonate's lungs (compared to vaginal delivery).",

Additionally, he has no neonatal risk factors (e.g., intrapartum fetal tachycardia, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, Apgar score ≤ 6) or maternal risk factors (e.g., Group B Streptococcus colonization, maternal fever, chorioamnionitis, prolonged rupture of membranes) for sepsis. However, given his clinical presentation, a CBC with differential should be obtained to rule out an infection. If tachypnea is persistent or if a complete blood count and differential suggests an infection, then blood cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and gentamicin) should be initiated.",

NRDS typically manifests with tachypnea, nasal flaring, moderate to severe retractions, and expiratory grunting. However, this condition usually affects premature infants who have insufficient surfactant levels. Also, chest x-ray in infants with NRDS would show bilateral ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms and decreased lung volumes; not fluid in the lung fissures. Additionally, breath sounds would be diminished on auscultation. While nasal CPAP may eventually be used, it is not the first step in the management of TTN.",

This patient's presentation is consistent with Turner syndrome, which is associated with both cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve, hypertension) and kidney disease (e.g., horseshoe kidneys) that can progress to severe cardiac or renal insufficiency with consequent renal hypoperfusion. However, this child has no other signs and symptoms to suggest cardiac or renal insufficiency. In addition, edema of the hands and feet in neonates with Turner syndrome has a different underlying mechanism.",

This newborn has a systolic murmur that suggests a bicuspid aortic valve, which could progress to aortic stenosis or insufficiency and cause left-sided heart failure (LHF).

However, edema is usually localized to the area of tissue injury or generalized in systemic reactions (e.g., sepsis, anaphylaxis). Peripheral edema of the hands and feet bilaterally would be untypical. Furthermore, this patient shows no symptoms of localized tissue damage such as erythema, and her normal vital signs make a systemic reaction unlikely.

        "explanation_why": "This patient most likely has neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) due to surfactant deficiency. NRDS is most common in premature infants because adequate surfactant concentration is not reached until 34 weeks' gestation. Without sufficient surfactant, increased surface tension of alveolar air sacs leads to their collapse, resulting in atelectasis, and decreased lung compliance. NRDS manifests up to 72 hours after birth with signs and symptoms of acute respiratory distress such as tachypnea (i.e., respiratory rate > 60/min), cyanosis, nasal flaring, expiratory grunting, intercostal retractions, and decreased breath sounds. Treatment primarily consists of noninvasive ventilation via nasal continuous positive airway pressure. If ventilation alone is unsuccessful, artificial surfactant can be administered endotracheally (see “Overview of NDRDS and its differential diagnoses” table).\n\nAs the lungs mature, lecithin levels, the major component of surfactant, increases. Therefore, amniotic fluid lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio can be used to assess for lung maturity, since sphingomyelin remains relatively constant. A ratio > 2 indicates adequate levels of surfactant.",

        "explanation_why": "Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation applying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is the first step in management of NRDS. Surfactant deficiency in NRDS leads to increased surface tension in the alveolar sacs that results in alveolar collapse, atelectasis, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. PEEP helps to prevent alveolar collapse by providing pressure at the end of expiration when alveoli are most prone to collapse. After initiation of CPAP, an arterial blood gas analysis should be obtained to assess the effectiveness of respiratory support. If FiO_2 > 0.4 or pH < 7.25, endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration are warranted. The younger the gestational age of the neonate, the greater the chance of CPAP failure and poor outcomes.\n\nBecause nasal CPAP is a noninvasive procedure, it should be attempted before surfactant therapy, which requires intubation and is associated with more complications (e.g., pulmonary injury, misplacement of the endotracheal tube).",

To reduce discomfort, the patient's sleeve can be pinned to the front of their shirt with the arm flexed at 90 degrees. Analgesics may also be considered. After 2 weeks, proper healing should be confirmed either via clinical examination (palpable callus formation) or x-ray.

While this patient's prematurity puts him at increased risk of developing AOP, the condition characteristically manifests with episodes of breathing pauses (usually > 20 seconds) that are frequently accompanied by hypoxemia and/or bradycardia. This patient has no evidence of prolonged apnea and his pulmonary findings are suggestive of a lung pathology rather than a lack of respiratory drive.",

A chest x-ray showing diffuse, ground-glass densities with atelectasis confirms the diagnosis. Treatment of NRDS primarily involves emergent resuscitative measures, including nasal continuous positive airway pressure and stabilizing blood sugar levels and electrolytes.\n\nSee “Overview of NRDS and its differential diagnoses” table.",

However, these tet spells are more common between the ages of 2 and 4 months rather than immediately following birth.

The inability to pass a catheter through the nasal cavities supports the presumptive diagnosis of choanal atresia. Confirmatory testing by CT scan or contrast rhinography in the supine position should follow. Unilateral choanal atresia is twice as prevalent as its bilateral counterpart.

However, key features of these conditions are missing and normocytic anemia would be expected (not microcytic anemia). Patients with anemia due to thalassemia typically have a high reticulocyte count and RBC count because of increased production in response to hemolysis.",

        "content": "Increased hemoglobin Barts concentration",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The production of alpha-globin is controlled by 2 genes (i.e., 4 alleles) on chromosome 16. The severity of alpha thalassemia is determined by the number of missing alleles. The absence of 3 alleles, as in this patient, indicates hemoglobin H disease (HbH disease), also referred to as alpha thalassemia intermedia (see “Overview of thalassemia” table). This condition is characterized by the presence of beta-globin tetramers, known as hemoglobin H (β4).\n\nDuring the first weeks of life, newborns express fetal gamma-globin rather than beta-globin. In newborns with HbH disease, the relative deficiency of alpha-globin chains causes the fetal gamma-globin chains to tetramerize and form hemoglobin Barts (γ4); in unaffected newborns, hemoglobin F (α2,γ2) would be produced instead. Although hemoglobin Barts can arise in any type of alpha thalassemia (e.g., it accounts for 3–8% of the total hemoglobin in alpha thalassemia minor), newborns with HbH disease usually have 20–40% hemoglobin Barts at birth; hemoglobin Barts is occasionally used as a newborn screening parameter for these conditions. Four to six weeks after birth, beta-globin levels become sufficiently high for hemoglobin H to form, which can be seen on electrophoresis. Further expected findings in HbH disease include an elevated RBC count and reticulocyte count; these features can be used to distinguish between HbH disease and other types of anemia, such as iron deficiency anemia.\n\nThe presence of hemoglobin Barts is most pronounced in the absence of all 4 alleles (i.e., hemoglobin Barts disease), which typically leads to hydrops fetalis.",

Severe forms of beta thalassemia (beta thalassemia major) manifest with pallor, microcytic anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice (due to hemolysis). However, the symptoms of beta thalassemia major usually appear after 4–6 months, when most of the beta-globin production occurs. Moreover, the production of beta-globin is controlled by a single gene (i.e., only 2 alleles). The absence of 3 alleles on genetic analysis and the onset of symptoms at birth suggest a diagnosis of alpha thalassemia. In alpha thalassemia, alpha-globin synthesis is affected and elevated HbA_2 is therefore not expected.",

A palpable, well-circumscribed mass within the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) due to fibrosis is also common. Ultrasound of the SCM can confirm the muscular origin of the mass. First-line treatment of congenital torticollis involves early initiation of physiotherapy with positioning exercises and passive stretching therapy to strengthen neck muscles, lengthen the SCM, and improve the cervical range of motion. The majority of cases of congenital torticollis resolve after 2–6 months of conservative management. In patients who do not improve after 12 months of conservative management, surgery (e.g., myotomy) is indicated to prevent complications such as cervical scoliosis and/or craniofacial asymmetry.",

It is most likely caused by the immaturity of the sweat glands and follicles. The rash appears on the trunk and proximal extremities, but the palms and soles are typically spared. Although erythema toxicum sounds ominous, the condition is benign and requires no treatment. Complete resolution of the rash occurs within 7–14 days.",

Concurrent injury to cervical sympathetic fibers may result in Horner syndrome (miosis and ptosis). Since C8 and T1 nerve fibers supply the ipsilateral intrinsic hand muscles, Klumpke palsy causes an absent grasp reflex.

Because glucose is passively transferred through the placenta, persistently elevated glucose concentrations in the mother throughout pregnancy leads to hyperinsulinemia in the developing fetus in order to maintain euglycemia. After birth, the combination of high insulin levels and the cessation of high glucose transfer from the mother results in transient hypoglycemia. Insulin production may take several hours to days to return to physiological levels; therefore, infants may require exogenous glucose administration to prevent life-threatening complications.",

            "description": "Omphalocele: herniation of intraabdominal contents through an anterior abdominal wall defect at the base of the umbilical cord caused by the failure of the midgut to return to the abdominal cavity after its physiological herniation through the umbilical ring. Accordingly, the hernial sac is formed by the amniotic membrane and peritoneum, and the umbilical cord lies at the apex of the hernia.Gastroschisis: a developmental defect of the anterior abdominal wall in the paraumbilical region through which intraabdominal contents prolapse. As it is the anterior abdominal wall that fails to develop correctly, there is no outer peritoneal or membranous covering.Congenital umbilical hernia: herniation of intraabdominal contents through a patent umbilical orifice, which typically closes by 2 years of age. The sac of a paraumbilical hernia is the peritoneum.Diastasis recti: an abnormally wide separation of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles. The abdominal fascia are intact. There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up).",

Fetal hyperinsulinemia results in an increased metabolic demand that can lead to fetal hypoxia, triggering RBC production and redistribution of iron from cardiac tissue into hemoglobin. The combination of cardiac tissue iron deficiency and hypoxemia can impair cardiac modeling, usually in the septal regions, and cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

In addition, intrapartum zidovudine is indicated to further reduce the risk of neonatal HIV infection (see “Intrapartum management of HIV” table).\n\nInfant antiretroviral prophylaxis is recommended in all newborns of mothers with HIV infection and includes either zidovudine alone for 4 weeks (viral load < 50 copies/mL) or cART for 6 weeks (viral load ≥ 50 copies/mL).",

However, there is no history to suggest polyuria (e.g., frequent changing of diapers), or evidence of severe dehydration in this patient (e.g., tenting of skin, sunken eyes, tachypnea, hypotension).

This subsequently results in hypokalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with urine that cannot be acidified to a pH < 5.5. The most likely cause of type 1 RTA in an infant is an inherited genetic defect. However, an ultrasound is usually performed to rule out other causes, such as nephrocalcinosis, medullary sponge kidney, and reflux nephropathy. Treatment of type 1 RTA consists of alkalization therapy with orally administered sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate.",

        "explanation_why": "Voiding cystourethrogram is the test of choice to diagnose posterior urethral valves (PUV), which is the most common cause of urinary tract obstruction (UTO) in newborn males. Lower UTO, indicated by the presence of bilateral hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound, results in reduced urine output and oligohydramnios. The decreased amount of amniotic fluid leads to the development of Potter sequence. Moreover, oligohydramnios can affect the development of the fetal lung resulting in lung hypoplasia, which is the most likely cause of this patient's cyanosis and hypoxia.\n\nOnce the vital functions have been stabilized, temporary insertion of a urinary catheter can relieve the UTO and allow for correction of possible electrolyte imbalances. Definitive treatment of PUV is either primary valve ablation during cystoscopy (first-line) or vesicostomy (in preterm boys or if ablation is not possible).",

Some of these defects are associated with certain genetic/chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot or persistent truncus arteriosus with DiGeorge syndrome), which often present with craniofacial anomalies. However, the patient's hydronephrosis and limb abnormalities cannot be explained by this diagnosis.",

Chest x-ray is used, however, for diagnosing infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and meconium aspiration. IRDS manifests most frequently in preterm infants, usually immediately after birth, with signs of increased breathing effort, hypoxia, cyanosis, and decreased breath sounds on auscultation. However, the additional clinical features seen in this neonate (e.g., craniofacial dysmorphism, limb abnormalities, and hydronephrosis) could not be explained by this diagnosis. Meconium aspiration syndrome manifests with respiratory distress or unresponsiveness usually in postterm rather than preterm infants. Furthermore, the absence of a green amniotic fluid makes the diagnosis unlikely in this patient.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This neonate, born to a mother with Graves disease, has features highly suggestive of neonatal thyrotoxicosis: irritability, restlessness, tachycardia, goiter, diaphoresis, increased bowel movement, and poor weight gain despite an adequate appetite.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Up to 5% of infants born to mothers with Graves disease develop thyrotoxicosis due to the transplacental passage of maternal stimulatory TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb). Symptoms may appear directly after birth or can be delayed up to 10 days as a result of transplacental maternal antithyroid medication (e.g., propylthiouracil, carbimazole). The thyrotoxicosis is transient and usually resolves within 12 weeks, when the maternal TRAb disappears from the infant's circulation. Before resolution, though, neonatal thyrotoxicosis should be treated as soon as it is diagnosed to prevent complications such as cardiac failure, intellectual disability, and craniosynostosis. Methimazole is administered to achieve a euthyroid state, which can take up to a few weeks. During this period, a beta blocker (e.g., propranolol) should be coadministered to rapidly control the thyrotoxic symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "Naloxone is an opioid antagonist which is used in the management of opioid toxicity. Given that this mother has a history of IV heroin use, this newborn may have been exposed in-utero, which would put him at risk of developing drug withdrawal symptoms (neonatal abstinence syndrome or NAS). Although patients with NAS due to heroin can present with irritability and restlessness, they mostly become symptomatic within 1–3 days after birth due to the short half-life of heroin. Other common symptoms of NAS are also not present, such as a high-pitched cry, feeding difficulties, vomiting, and refusal to sleep and to be consoled. Moreover, naloxone is not used in the treatment of NAS. NAS due to heroin withdrawal is treated with opioid therapy (e.g., morphine, methadone) with gradual tapering and discontinuation.",

Risk factors for the development of neonatal hypocalcemia include maternal diabetes/hyperparathyroidism and prematurity (for early-onset hypocalcemia, < 2 days after birth) and cow's milk/high-phosphate formula feeds (for late-onset hypocalcemia, > 3 days after birth). Late-onset hypocalcemia is very rare. In this neonate, the presence of a goiter and a maternal history of Graves' disease make the diagnosis of hypocalcemia unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has features consistent with congenital hypothyroidism (poor feeding and lethargy, a raspy/hoarse cry, prolonged newborn jaundice, umbilical hernia, increased head circumference, muscle hypotonia, macroglossia). The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions is thyroid dysgenesis (i.e., thyroid hypoplasia, dysplasia, or aplasia). Early initiation of thyroxine supplementation is essential to prevent the patient from developing permanent intellectual disability. If the mother has clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism, the manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism may be apparent at birth; if the mother is euthyroid, the manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism develop a few weeks to months after birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone. Therefore, neonatal screening for thyroid deficiency is indicated even if the neonate is asymptomatic; screening is mandatory in the US and typically performed by measuring TSH levels 24–48 hours after birth.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "Calcium homeostasis is influenced by a delicate interplay of hormones (e.g., PTH, Vitamin D) and electrolytes (e.g., Ca^2+, Mg^2+). During pregnancy, the fetus' metabolic balance largely depends on regulatory processes in the mother's body. When these maternal regulatory processes cease after birth, the newborn may experience rebound symptoms (as seen with neonatal hypoglycemia in response to maternal diabetes).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This newborn's mother most likely has familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). In this condition, a decreased sensitivity to renal and parathyroid Ca^2+-sensing receptors causes a need for higher levels of Ca^2+ to suppress PTH. To satisfy this need, renal Ca^2+ reabsorption increases and, in turn, leads to hypocalciuria and hypercalcemia with an inappropriately normal or increased PTH. Because affected individuals are usually asymptomatic, the condition may go unnoticed, as is likely the case in the mother here. During pregnancy, maternal hypercalcemia causes fetal hypercalcemia and suppresses the fetal parathyroid glands. After birth, when the mother is not supplying the child with calcium via the placenta anymore, the neonate's suppressed PTH levels result in hypocalcemia, as seen here.",

In this syndrome, hypoplastic parathyroids result in decreased PTH production and subsequent symptoms of hypocalcemia (e.g., jitteriness, seizures). Although this diagnosis could explain this newborn's symptoms and serum studies (i.e., low calcium and low PTH), the absence of other typical features of DiGeorge syndrome, such as dysmorphic facial features, lymphopenia, and signs of congenital heart disease (e.g., cyanosis, abnormal echocardiogram), makes the diagnosis less likely.",

Therefore, the use of cow's milk or formulas with a high phosphate concentration should be avoided. In contrast to this patient's early-onset hypocalcemia, infants with hypocalcemia due to high phosphate intake usually present at 5–10 days of age (i.e., late-onset hypocalcemia).",

Moreover, the patient described here has bilious vomiting, a finding that is less likely with an obstruction caused by a hypertrophic pylorus, which is proximal to the ampulla of Vater and is therefore more commonly associated with nonbilious vomiting. While ultrasonography can be used in the diagnosis of intestinal malrotation and midgut volvulus, it is not the most sensitive diagnostic technique. For this reason, it is not the most appropriate next step in management.",

Sigmoid volvulus is most commonly seen in elderly adults and manifests with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloating. This young patient most likely has a more proximal intestinal pathology, meaning that sigmoidoscopy would not be appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Preterm infants have lower iron stores, smaller total blood volume, lower placental iron transfer, and greater blood loss through phlebotomy than infants born at term. Because these infants are rapidly growing, they have greater daily iron needs than infants born at term. As breast milk does not contain enough iron to meet these requirements, daily iron supplementation is necessary until consuming the recommended daily intake of iron through diet.\n\nFurthermore, all exclusively breastfed infants should receive Vitamin D supplementation from birth until meeting the recommended daily vitamin D intake through diet to prevent rickets. A single dose of vitamin K after birth prevents vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn.",

Vitamin D deficiency is a concern in exclusively breastfed infants who do not receive vitamin D prophylaxis. However, only a prolonged and severe vitamin D deficiency would result in hypocalcemia, and this condition is therefore unlikely in a 2-week-old patient. Furthermore, breast milk supplies the infant with abundant calcium, which makes hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism very unlikely.",

Breast milk contains very low amounts of vitamin K, so the risk of bleeding does not decrease with breastfeeding. All newborns typically receive an intramuscular vitamin K shot at birth to mitigate this risk. Because this child was delivered at home without any medical intervention, it is very likely that he did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis and is consequently at increased risk of bleeding, including potentially severe brain hemorrhage.",

However, this newborn was born at term and the delivery did not involve any complications. Breastfed infants are also at risk of IDA because breast milk contains only limited amounts of iron. To prevent IDA in breastfed infants, they should receive an additional iron source starting by 4 months of age in full-term infants and by 2 weeks of age in premature infants.

Delivery was uncomplicated, and she and her child received adequate postnatal care. Three days ago, she was diagnosed with mastitis, which is managed with cold compresses and ibuprofen. She has chronic hepatitis B infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her other medication is pantoprazole. She uses cocaine once every 1–2 months and smokes one-half pack of cigarettes daily. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is positive for CMV antibodies. The patient is apprehensive about taking care of her baby and asks for information on breastfeeding. Which of the following is most likely a contraindication for breastfeeding in this patient?",

Therefore, it is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Medications such as amiodarone, antineoplastics, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, and radiopharmaceuticals are among a small list of drugs that are contraindications to breastfeeding.",

        "explanation_why": "Mastitis is partially a consequence of the inability to fully empty the breast during breastfeeding, resulting in breast milk stasis and an increased risk for infection. Although mastitis often causes pain and swelling, it is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, and nursing mothers should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding. This recommendation usually also applies when the management of mastitis includes ibuprofen or a first-line antibiotic (e.g., dicloxacillin) since both substances are excreted in the milk in small enough quantities to be considered safe to use in breastfeeding.",

        "explanation_why": "Certain recreational drugs that are excreted in breast milk (e.g., cocaine, phencyclidine) may lead to acute toxicity and long-term negative effects on neurobehavioral development in the breastfeeding infant. Therefore, active use of these substances is a contraindication to breastfeeding. In addition, breastfeeding may be contraindicated during periods in which the mother uses certain medications (e.g., tetracycline, chloramphenicol, chemotherapy agents, lithium) or has certain infections (e.g., herpes with breast lesions). Absolute contraindications to breastfeeding include maternal HIV infection (except in resource-limited countries where formula may not be available), maternal Ebola virus disease, and infant galactosemia (because of the presence of galactose in breast milk).\n\nMarijuana is also detectable in breast milk, but according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, evidence of adverse effects in breastfeeding infants is limited. Although marijuana use is not contraindicated, it is still strongly discouraged during breastfeeding. In addition, mothers should be strongly advised to abstain from any kind of smoking because of the increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome.",

However, because there is no evidence of direct introduction of toxins or other contaminants into breast milk, smoking is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding (even in mothers who smoke) is associated with better infant respiratory and immunological development compared to formula.",

Although this patient's findings could be due to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, the timing, duration, and severity of jaundice are more suggestive of a physiologic process. For this reason, and because there is no family history of neonatal jaundice, diagnostic evaluation or treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome is not indicated at this point.",

Both conditions can manifest with neonatal jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia. However, since the excretion of bilirubin via bile into the intestine is disrupted, the direct bilirubin would be elevated. In addition, acholic stools (because bilirubin does not reach the intestine to be converted to urobilin and stercobilin) and dark urine (due to excretion of bilirubin via the urine) would be expected in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Hepatomegaly and mild to moderate elevation of the aminotransferases are also usually present. In this neonate with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, an extrahepatic obstruction is unlikely.",

Physiological neonatal jaundice, which is caused by a physiological rise in unconjugated bilirubin, is very common (affecting around half of term infants) and typically occurs between the second and eighth day of life. Because newborns have a higher hematocrit (due to relative hypoxia during the fetal period) and a shorter life span of fetal red blood cells (RBCs), RBC turnover is increased within the first 3 months of life, resulting in higher bilirubin production. In addition, the hepatic conjugation and elimination pathways for bilirubin are still immature due to decreased activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin is also increased because the concentration of bacteria in the neonatal digestive tract is low and therefore only a small amount of bilirubin is converted to urobilinogen and subsequently excreted.\n\nJaundice occurring within the first 24 hours of life or persisting > 1 week should raise suspicion for underlying pathology and warrants further diagnostic tests. Additional symptoms such as poor feeding and drowsiness would also warrant further evaluation.",

However, jaundice is usually severe with total bilirubin concentrations reaching 20–50 mg/dL, which often causes neurological symptoms due to kernicterus (e.g., seizures, cerebral paresis, hearing impairment, vertical gaze palsy). Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I should be suspected in neonates with excessive, persistent jaundice despite adequate treatment.

This newborn is only fed every four hours, which is usually not adequate for proper weight gain and hydration. A newborn should be nursed whenever he appears to be hungry or every three hours since the last breastfeeding session (whichever comes first), resulting in around 8–12 breastfeedings within 24 hours. In the first days of life, a newborn with adequate breast milk intake should have ≥ 1 wet diaper per day of age (e.g., ≥ 4 wet diapers in a 4-day-old) and at least one stool per day.",

Although neonates with HDFN typically present with jaundice, the yellowing of the skin is usually present at birth or develops within the first 24 hours of life. Furthermore, the total serum bilirubin levels would be higher than in this infant. In addition, patients with severe HDFN would have signs of hemolysis and anemia (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly, hypoxia) as a result of the rapid breakdown of antigen-antibody complexes and fetal red blood cells in the spleen.",

Although this patient's findings could be due to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, the absence of a family history of neonatal jaundice makes this diagnosis unlikely.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Insufficient breast milk intake can lead to neonatal weight loss and breastfeeding failure jaundice. The decreased intake of fluid and calories leads to hypovolemia and an increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin (due to decreased frequency of bowel movements), resulting in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, typically within the first week of life. Problems with breastfeeding may be due to inadequate milk production or extraction (e.g., infrequent feeding, ineffective latch-on or suckling, and separation of baby and mother). This newborn is only fed six times per day, which is usually not adequate for proper weight gain and hydration. A newborn should be nursed whenever he appears to be hungry or every three hours since the last breastfeeding session (whichever comes first), resulting in around 8–12 breastfeedings within 24 hours.\n\nBreastfeeding failure jaundice is different from breast milk jaundice. While breastfeeding failure jaundice results from insufficient breast milk intake, breast milk jaundice is directly caused by elevated β-glucuronidase in the breast milk.",

Both conditions may manifest with neonatal jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia. However, since the excretion of bilirubin via bile into the intestine is disrupted, direct bilirubin would be elevated. In addition, acholic stools (because bilirubin does not reach the intestine to be converted to urobilin and stercobilin), and dark urine (due to excretion of bilirubin via the urine) would be expected in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Furthermore, hepatomegaly and mild to moderate elevations of the aminotransferases are usually present. In this neonate with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, an extrahepatic obstruction is unlikely, and therefore, abdominal sonography is not necessary.",

It most often occurs between the second and eighth day of life in term infants with indirect hyperbilirubinemia (< 9 mg/dL) without other concerning signs or symptoms on physical examination. Although this patient has indirect hyperbilirubinemia, her bilirubin concentrations are much higher and she presents later than would be expected with physiologic neonatal jaundice.",

This condition most often causes jaundice that appears within the first 24 hours of life, as the newborn becomes unable to completely clear bilirubin on his or her own after birth (the placenta helps eliminate bilirubin in utero). The hallmark laboratory finding is anemia; this patient, however, has a normal hematocrit.",

When establishing the diagnosis, it is important to identify the absence of concerning signs of dehydration (tachycardia, dry membranes, poor capillary refill; seen in breastfeeding failure jaundice) or anemia (tachycardia, decreased hematocrit; seen in hemolysis causing hyperbilirubinemia). Breastfeeding should be continued in neonates with breast milk jaundice, as bilirubin levels usually normalize spontaneously within 2–3 months. Phototherapy and evaluation for other causes of hyperbilirubinemia may be necessary if total bilirubin levels rise above an age-specific threshold.\n\nIn neonates, a normal liver can be palpated up to 3 cm below the costal margin. Livers larger than this may be considered enlarged and warrant further attention.",

He weighed 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",

Although this patient's mother has a history of Graves disease and the antibodies can pass the placenta, TgAbs are not thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism in Graves disease. Rather, they are believed to be a response to rapid cell destruction/disordered growth and subsequent release of circulating free thyroglobulin into the bloodstream. They are therefore not likely to be the cause of this infant's symptoms.",

Since toxic adenomas produce large amounts of thyroid hormones, independent of normal hypothalamic-pituitary feedback regulation, they also cause hyperthyroidism.

        "explanation_why": "Up to 5% of infants born to mothers with Graves disease develop thyrotoxicosis due to the transplacental passage of maternal stimulatory TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAbs). TRAbs are present in ∼ 90% of patients with Graves disease and cause increased growth and function of the thyroid gland and the subsequent development of hyperthyroidism and goiter. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis is transient and usually resolves within 12 weeks, when maternal TRAbs disappear from the infant's circulation. Although the condition is transient, symptomatic neonatal thyrotoxicosis should be treated as soon as it is diagnosed to prevent complications such as cardiac failure, intellectual disability, and craniosynostosis. Therapy consists of methimazole to achieve a euthyroid state and a beta blocker (e.g., propranolol) to rapidly control the thyrotoxic symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "A lumbar puncture should be performed in suspected meningitis, which may also manifest with high-pitched crying and irritability. There should be a very low threshold for suspecting meningitis in young children since the classic triad of meningitis (i.e., fever, headache, and neck stiffness) is frequently not present. However, this patient is generally well, afebrile, and lacks further symptoms of meningitis such as an altered mental status, vomiting, and/or a bulging fontanelle (due to increased ICP).",

However, new systematic reviews have not demonstrated the efficacy of its use. Excess gas should rather be eliminated by changing feeding techniques such as bottle-feeding in a vertical position using a curved bottle (to allow frequent burping and reduce air-swallowing).",

First-line interventions in patients with infantile colic include parental support, changes to feeding (e.g., changing the volume of feeds, adequate burping), and initiation of soothing techniques (e.g., use of a pacifier, placing the child in a swing, rocking the infant).",

        "explanation_why": "Gestational diabetes mellitus leads to fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, thereby increasing the overall metabolic rate and oxygen demand of the fetus. Placental capacity is exhausted and hypoxemia develops, leading to increased erythropoiesis. Polycythemia develops, which can cause hyperviscosity syndrome after birth and may result in cerebral infarctions that lead to seizures. Hypoglycemia is also common in neonates born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus because of hyperinsulinemia that can persist in infants up to several days after birth. Additionally, hypocalcemia occurs more often in infants of diabetic mothers, although its mechanism is not entirely understood.",

The timing of the recurrent PTB is often similar to the previous one(s). This patient's first child was delivered at 27 weeks' gestation, and she does not have a history of term delivery since then.

Pregnancy and delivery of her first 2 children were complicated by iron deficiency anemia. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. She does not use illicit drugs. She has a history of a seizure disorder controlled by lamotrigine; other medications are folic acid, iron supplements, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 144/96 mm Hg. She recalls that during blood pressure self-monitoring yesterday morning her blood pressure was 140/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies, including serum concentrations of glucose and thyroid-stimulating hormone, are within normal limits. This patient's child is most likely to develop which of the following?",

About 25% of women with chronic hypertension go on to develop preeclampsia during pregnancy. Fetal complications of preeclampsia include intrauterine growth restriction and subsequent small for gestational age neonates, as well as abruptio placentae, premature delivery, and intrauterine fetal death. Pregnant women with hypertension therefore require close surveillance to detect if the condition progresses to preeclampsia.",

Fetal conditions that are associated with polyhydramnios include esophageal or duodenal atresia, CNS anomalies, congenital TORCH infections, and chromosomal aberrations. Oligohydramnios, on the other hand, can occur secondary to preeclampsia.

Hypoaldosteronism causes hypotension and hyperkalemia. Hypocortisolism leads to an increase in the secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland. Stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH results in an increase in the production of adrenal androgens, which cause masculinization of the genital tubercle. The diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia can be established by screening for increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels in fetal blood.",

The patient's blood type is Rh-negative. She received all of her prenatal care for this pregnancy including a dose of anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks' gestation. Four hours after arrival, a healthy 3650-g (8-lb) female newborn is delivered. Delivery of the fetus is followed by placental retention and heavy vaginal bleeding. One hour later, the placenta is manually removed and the bleeding ceases. The mother's temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Examination shows blood on the vulva, the introitus, and on the medial aspect of each thigh. The neonate's blood type is Rh-positive. The rosette test is positive.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "In order to prevent Rh sensitization in nonsensitized Rh-negative mothers, anti-D immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) is administered at 28 weeks' gestation (typically a single standard dose without confirmation of the fetal blood type) and, if the newborn is Rh-positive, within 72 hours following delivery. The risk of Rh sensitization is proportional to the amount of fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The risk of FMH is highest in the peripartum period and is further increased if the mother has antenatal or peripartum hemorrhage. The standard dose of RhoGAM to prevent Rh sensitization can neutralize approx. 15 mL of fetal RBCs (or approx. 30 mL of fetal whole blood volume). The dosage of RhoGAM that should be given in the postpartum period is determined by the amount of FMH. Therefore, fetomaternal hemorrhage tests are indicated before the administration of RhoGAM. The rosette test, which is sensitive in detecting FMH, is used as the initial screening test but it is a qualitative test. If the patient has a positive rosette test, a quantitative test such as the Kleihauer-Betke test (KB test) or flow cytometry should be performed to determine the amount of FMH and the exact dosage of RhoGAM required.\n\nFlow cytometry is more expensive and less readily available than the KB test but is necessary if the mother has a concomitant hemoglobinopathy because the KB test is unreliable in this scenario. If for any reason, laboratory testing to detect and quantify FMH cannot be performed within 72 hours after delivery (the ideal time for RhoGAM administration), blood samples for these tests should be drawn before administering the first dose of RhoGAM.",

RhoGAM has a half-life of 6 weeks and once RhoGAM is administered, as was done here, maternal anti-D antibody screening will yield a false-positive result for approx. 6–7 months. Moreover, anti-D antibody screening does not provide any information in the peripartum period about FMH.",

The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated, which provides only minimal improvement in his symptoms. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this newborn?",

In moderate to severe cases (e.g., inability to sleep or feed, severe diarrhea with dehydration) or if supportive treatment is unsuccessful, as seen here, opioid replacement is indicated to treat the withdrawal and ensure that infants can gain weight. First-line pharmacological treatment options include oral morphine, buprenorphine, and methadone. Second-line treatment includes phenobarbital and clonidine.",

She is exclusively breastfed every 3–4 hours for 15–20 minutes. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not yet been evaluated by a physician. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. The mother had no prenatal care. The infant has not received any immunizations. She is at the 5^th percentile for height and weight. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Physical examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. On pulmonary examination, crackles are heard over the lung fields bilaterally. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

In addition, this disorder is caused by an X-linked recessive defect, but the patient is female, which makes a diagnosis of CGD very unlikely.",

A polymerase chain reaction test (PCR test) is used to diagnose HIV in children < 18 months of age. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) cannot be used in children < 18 months of age, because maternal HIV IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta, possibly leading to false-positive results.\n\nHIV testing is recommended for all pregnant women in the first trimester. In pregnant patients with HIV and an unknown viral load, scheduled cesarean delivery is usually recommended at 38 weeks' gestation to decrease the risk of vertical transmission. In mothers with HIV who have infants without HIV, breastfeeding should be avoided if possible. However, in resource-limited countries, breastfeeding may be considered. Maternal adherence to antiretroviral therapy decreases the risk of HIV transmission from breast milk.",

NADPH is essential for converting oxidized glutathione back to its reduced form (GSH). The reduced glutathione is capable of neutralizing reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) and free radicals, thereby protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage.In G6PD deficiency, glutathione cannot be reduced and erythrocytes become susceptible to oxidative stress, resulting in damage to the erythrocyte membrane, and thus intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.",

        "explanation_why": "Impaired production of erythropoietin (EPO) is the primary cause of anemia of prematurity (AOP). EPO is produced by the fetal liver as well as fetal kidneys and production increases with gestational age. EPO levels and erythropoiesis show a physiological decrease after birth, as the onset of breathing and the closure of the ductus arteriosus increase tissue oxygenation. Preterm children are born with a lower hematocrit than full-term newborns, which is complicated by the physiologically reduced EPO production after birth. This effect results in AOP. Poor oxygen delivery to the tissue leads to clinical signs and symptoms of AOP (e.g., episodes of apnea). Laboratory findings for AOP include normocytic, normochromic anemia with a low-normal reticulocyte count, all of which are present in this patient.\n\nManagement of AOP includes limitation of blood withdrawals, iron supplementation (routinely done in preterm infants), and RBC transfusions if necessary (taking into account restrictive guidelines for transfusions in neonates). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (e.g., recombinant EPO) are not routinely administered due to limited efficacy and severe side effects (e.g., retinopathy of prematurity). Anemia is typically self-limiting and resolves around three to six months of age.",

Higher arterial oxygen tension in a premature infant inhibits the production of VEGF, leading to apoptosis of endothelial cells and cessation of normal retinal vascular formation. Switching to room air results in relative hypoxia due to the lower oxygen concentration, increased metabolic demand of the growing retina, and poor vascular network, leading to the production of proangiogenic growth factors (e.g., VEGF) and uncontrolled neovascularization. The formation of new blood vessels can cause hemorrhages, form fibrovascular membranes, and ultimately lead to retinal detachment or blindness.",

        "explanation_why": "In patients with TOF, the right ventricular outflow obstruction (RVOO) due to central pulmonary valve stenosis and hypoplasia determines cyanosis severity and systolic heart murmur intensity. The higher the degree of RVOO, the more (unoxygenated) blood will bypass pulmonary circulation and shunt straight through the VSD to the left ventricle (LV). The lower the degree of RVOO, the more blood flows through the lungs and becomes oxygenated before reaching the LV, resulting in a reduction of cyanosis. In TOF, the single S_2 can result from an attenuated pulmonary component (P_2) that is often not heard on auscultation.",

RVH is a compensatory mechanism against the outflow tract obstruction, which helps to reduce cyanosis by increasing flow through the stenotic pulmonary vasculature, so that deoxygenated blood does not flow through the VSD and into the systemic circulation. However, RVH can only compensate to a small degree to improve normal circulatory flow and is, therefore, only a minor determinant of cyanosis.",

    "correct_answer": "F",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Echocardiography showing a pulmonary artery arising from the left ventricle and aorta arising from the right ventricle confirms the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) which is an important cause of neonatal cyanosis that will not improve with supplemental oxygen. The continuous machine-like murmur indicates a coexistent patent ductus arteriosus, which is critical for life, as it allows mixing of oxygenated blood and its entry into the systemic circulation. Patients may also have coexistent arterial or ventricular septal defects that allow mixing of blood between the two circuits.",

Neonates with HLHS also have weak peripheral pulses, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis as the hypoplastic left ventricle cannot maintain adequate cardiac output.

Exertion, such as crying or feeding, increases the RVOO. This results in cyanosis (tet spells) due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD instead of the pulmonary valve, which in turn causes the murmur to become softer. The right ventricle hypertrophies because it chronically pumps against high resistance caused by the RVOO.\n\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during a tet spell. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases left ventricular pressure and decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the VSD. Infants who are having a tet spell should be placed with their knees toward their chest to achieve the same effect.",

        "explanation_why": "Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in infants is usually due to a malformed and displaced tricuspid valve in Ebstein anomaly. These infants may develop cyanosis only if there's an associated ASD or PFO that allows for right-to-left shunting of blood. Auscultation would reveal a holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border, like in this patient, with a widely split S2. However, a chest x-ray in Ebstein anomaly will show right atrial enlargement (due to chronic reflux of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium) - not a boot-shaped heart as seen in this infant.",

            "description": "In the Ebstein anomaly, the tricuspid valve is displaced into the lumen of the right ventricle, resulting in atrialization of the right ventricle. The remaining ventricle is small and hypocontractile. Because tricuspid valve regurgitation is also usually present, there is retrograde flow in the right atrium, which is dilated by the volume overload, in addition to antegrade pulmonary blood flow. Blood flows through the patent foramen ovale or (commonly associated) atrial septal defect from the right atrium to the left atrium (right-to-left shunt) and then via the left ventricle into the circulation, resulting in pronounced cyanosis. The pulmonary circulation system may also be perfused through blood from the aorta (via the ductus arteriosus).",

        "explanation_why": "Decreased intrauterine space during pregnancy (e.g., due to fetal macrosomia, multiple gestation, oligohydramnios) is a risk factor for the development of torticollis as it may lead to fetal malpositioning and/or decreased intrauterine fetal movement. In addition, fetal macrosomia, breech presentation, and assisted vaginal delivery can cause perinatal trauma to the sternocleidomastoid muscles, which is another risk factor for the development of congenital torticollis.",

Oligohydramnios can also affect fetal lung development, resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia. This infant's cyanosis and respiratory distress are likely due to pulmonary hypoplasia, which is also the most common cause of death in Potter sequence.",

Although the exact mechanism is not fully understood, this type of hypocalcemia may be due to abnormal maternal calcium-phosphorus metabolism, and/or decreased maternal vitamin D concentrations. Infants of diabetic mothers are also at risk for hypomagnesemia due to maternal renal loss of magnesium from glycosuria. These low levels of magnesium can impair parathyroid hormone release, resulting in hypoparathyroidism that may also contribute to hypocalcemia.",

The toxin reaches the CNS via retrograde axonal transport and blocks the release of glycine and GABA from inhibitory interneurons (Renshaw cells). This causes uncontrolled activation of alpha motor neurons, which results in tonic and clonic spasms (difficulty opening the mouth and feeding due to trismus, clenched hands). The most effective measure to prevent neonatal tetanus is immunization of women who are pregnant or of childbearing age. Vaccinated women produce antibodies against tetanospasmin that can cross the placenta, which provided passive immunity for the neonate.",

Infantile cataracts are caused by accumulation of galactitol in the eye lens. Hypoglycemia develops because galactose cannot be used for glycolysis, and in breastfeeding newborns, lactose (broken down into glucose and galactose) is the main source of nutrition. If galactosemia is left untreated, complications such as cirrhosis, renal failure, hypogonadism, seizures, and brain damage can occur. Another milder form of galactosemia is galactokinase deficiency, which also causes infantile cataracts but does not cause damage to other organs such as the liver damage in this patient. Since these manifestations can be prevented by avoiding milk products, guidelines in the US state that all newborns should be screened for galactosemia.\n\nNeonates with classic galactosemia are at increased risk of developing sepsis due to E. coli.",

A UDP molecule is then transferred to the resulting galactose-1-phosphate. This molecule is provided by UDP-glucose and transferred through Gal-1-P uridylyltransferase; in this process, glucose-1-phosphate is released that can be converted to glucose-6-phosphate and introduced to the glycolysis. Next, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase can transfer UDP-galactosis to the UDP-glucose; then, it can be either directly used for the glycosynthesis or react with another molecule to galactose 1-phosphate.",

Congenital rubella syndrome usually only results if the infection occurs during organogenesis (i.e., during the first 1–8 weeks of gestation). If the transmission occurs after 16 weeks' gestation, the risk of developing congenital rubella syndrome is extremely low.

Hypocortisolism leads to an increase in the secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland. Stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH results in an increase in the production of mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone, deoxycorticosterone). While hyperaldosteronism causes hypertension and hypokalemia, the deficiency of androgens is responsible for male pseudohermaphroditism. Patients with XX genotype are usually diagnosed later because of lack of developing secondary sexual development and primary amenorrhea.",

This shunt leads to volume overload (recirculation) of the blood within the pulmonary vessels, the left atrium, and left ventricle (2). Eventually, because of the increased blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, pulmonary hypertension may develop as well as Eisenmenger syndrome, which involves a shunt reversal. The left-to-right-shunt without cyanosis becomes a right-to-left shunt with cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Pink: structures that contain mixed blood",

    "hint": "Increased nuchal translucency, decreased levels of PAPP-A, shortened femur length, shortened fifth digits with clinodactyly, and a small nasal bone in a fetus with a 47, XX karyotype are features highly suggestive of trisomy 21 (i.e., Down syndrome).",

While Edwards syndrome can also manifest with increased nuchal translucency and decreased PAPP-A during first-trimester screening, as well as a 47, XX karyotype, this patient's shortened femur length, shortened fifth digits with clinodactyly, and hypoplastic nasal bone are indicative of Down syndrome. Ultrasound findings typical of Edwards syndrome include rocker-bottom feet and clenched fists with overlapping of the third and fourth digits by the second and fifth digits, respectively (rather than clinodactyly).",

When there is heteroplasmy in the parental cell (P), levels of heteroplasmy can increase, decrease, or stay the same in subsequent filial generations (F1, F2), resulting in variable disease expression. Severity often correlates with the proportion of mutated mtDNA. In some conditions, the disease phenotype is only expressed once the proportion of mutated mtDNA is above a certain threshold.",

The right ventricular pressure remains unchanged. These hemodynamic changes would not, however, be expected after the closure of a VSD.",

Closure of a VSD would, therefore, increase the amount of blood in the left ventricle and decrease the amount of blood in the right ventricle during each cardiac cycle. This results in an increase in left ventricular pressure and a decrease in right ventricular pressure as well as right ventricular output, which translates to a decrease in the amount of blood flowing into the left atrium and therefore a decrease in left atrial pressure.",

Blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (white arrow) along the pressure gradient (1). This leads to increased RV and LV preload (due to increased end-diastolic volume), ventricular hypertrophy and dilation (double-headed white arrows), and pulmonary hypertension resulting from excessive pulmonary blood flow (2). In end-stage disease, the pressure gradient is reversed because of Eisenmenger syndrome (shunt reversal), leading to the flow of mixed blood to the systemic circulation (white arrow) and subsequent cyanosis (3).Blue: structures that contain deoxygenated blood; Red: structures that contain oxygenated blood; Purple: structures that contain mixed blood",

This mutation leads to cystic dilation of the distal nephron and collecting ducts. ARPKD can cause in-utero renal failure, subsequently leading to maternal oligohydramnios and Potter sequence. ARPKD is also associated with progressive hepatic fibrosis, which can cause portal hypertension and liver failure.",

The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions is thyroid dysgenesis, i.e., thyroid hypoplasia, dysplasia, or aplasia. Early initiation of thyroxine supplementation is essential in this patient to prevent intellectual disability. Most children with congenital hypothyroidism do not display symptoms at the time of birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone. Therefore, neonatal screening is crucial even if children are asymptomatic.\n\nNeonatal screening is mandatory in the US and includes measurement of TSH levels 24–48 hours after birth.",

Therefore, vitamin D supplementation is recommended in all exclusively breastfed infants until the recommended daily vitamin D intake through diet is met. Dietary sources of vitamin D include ≥ 34 oz/day of infant formula, solid foods, and, once the infant is 12 months old, vitamin D-fortified whole milk. This supplementation protects against hypocalcemia and rickets, a disease of bone deformities in children due to a deficiency of vitamin D. Rickets is characterized by impaired calcification of the bones, delayed closure of the fontanelles, frontal bossing, prominence of costochondral junctions (“rachitic rosary”), and genu valgum or genu varum. Children with rickets present with varying degrees of pain, poor growth, motor delays, and an increased risk of infections.",

Maternal use of vasoconstrictive drugs (e.g., cocaine, MDMA, or cigarettes) increases the risk for this malformation.\n\nIntestinal atresia of any origin is suggested by a prenatal history of polyhydramnios, since the fetus cannot drink the amniotic fluid due to the intestinal obstruction.",

While most patients are asymptomatic at birth, half of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have seizures with cerebral foci, a lag of psychomotor development and a musty body odor by 4–6 months of age. Additional features include light, pale hair and blue eyes (due to decreased melanin production). Since most patients are asymptomatic until severe and often irreversible complications have occurred, direct measurement of phenylalanine levels is an important part of newborn screening for metabolic disorders.

        "explanation_why": "Germinal matrix hemorrhage is the underlying cause of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in preterm infants. IVH is a common complication in preterm infants that usually occurs within the first five days after birth. It is typically seen in neonates weighing < 1500 g and born before 32 weeks' gestation due to the fragility of the germinal matrix. Additional risk factors include peripartal chorioamnionitis and hypoxia (as suggested by this patient's low Apgar scores). Most infants with IVH are asymptomatic, but saltatory (over several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible. Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, seizures, bulging anterior fontanelle, cranial nerve abnormalities (e.g., pupil reacting sluggishly to light), and changes in eye movement (e.g., roving eye movements), all of which this patient has.\n\nCranial ultrasonography is the preferred method to diagnose IVH in the newborn. Since most patients are asymptomatic, screening ultrasounds are routinely performed in infants with a birth weight < 1500 g and delivery before 30 weeks' gestation.",

            "title": "Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)",
            "description": "Ultrasound head (top row: coronal plane; bottom row: parasagittal plane) of a newbornThe first column shows bleeding confined to the subependymal germinal matrix (red overlay), which is consistent with grade 1 IVH.\nThe second column shows blood occupying less than 50% of the left lateral ventricle (red overlay), with no enlargement of the lateral ventricles (yellow overlay) or the cavum septi pellucidi (green overlay). In addition, the choroid plexus is clearly demarcated (blue overlay). Together, these findings are consistent with grade 2 IVH.\nThe third column shows blood occupying more than 50% of the lateral ventricles (red overlay) with enlargement of the cavum septi pellucidi (green overlay) and both lateral ventricles (yellow overlay). This appearance is consistent with grade 3 IVH.These features suggest impaired progressive posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) due to associated impairment of CSF circulation, which is a potential complication of high-grade IVH.",

This condition most often causes jaundice and severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia that appear within the first 24 hours of life. Although this newborn's incompatibility with his mother's Rhesus type puts him at risk for HDFN, his normal hemoglobin and low reticulocyte count make hemolysis unlikely.",

This condition is caused by several components of bilirubin metabolism in newborns, including immaturity of the pathways for hepatic conjugation and elimination (due to decreased activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin (due to low bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and certain breast milk components), and the short life span of erythrocytes in newborns. Treatment of neonatal jaundice by phototherapy is indicated if bilirubin levels increase above a defined threshold.\n\nExclusively breastfed newborns are more likely to develop physiological neonatal jaundice.",

This newborn has already surpassed his birth weight and the mother reports breastfeeding him frequently without difficulty, making insufficient breastfeeding an unlikely cause of his jaundice.",

Symptoms usually develop after the neonatal period and include developmental delay and seizures (due to phenylalanine accumulation in the CNS), hypopigmentation (due to a lack of melanin production from low levels of tyrosine), and eczema, all of which are present in this case. In addition, PKU manifests with a characteristic mousy or musty odor due to excretion of phenylalanine metabolites in the urine and sweat. PKU is typically detected by newborn screening for metabolic disorders.",

NADPH is essential for converting oxidized glutathione back to its reduced form (GSH). The reduced glutathione is capable of neutralizing reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) and free radicals, thereby protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage.In G6PD deficiency, glutathione cannot be reduced and erythrocytes become susceptible to oxidative stress, resulting in damage to the erythrocyte membrane, and thus intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.",

In addition, newborns have sterile intestines, and the establishment of gut microflora that synthesizes vitamin K takes approximately 6 months. As vitamin K is necessary for the production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, not supplementing it within a few hours after birth can enable a potentially fatal hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Another risk factor for vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn is prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

The clinical presentation is variable and includes features such as congenital heart defects, craniofacial abnormalities, cleft palate, and thymus/parathyroid aplasia or hypoplasia. Murmurs are attributable to structural heart disease and tetany arises from the hypocalcemia of hypoparathyroidism. This mother presents with signs and symptoms most concerning for maternal Graves disease, which is not associated with neonatal DiGeorge syndrome.",

During pregnancy, TSH receptor antibodies cross the placenta, leading to neonatal Graves disease and thyrotoxicosis. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis is most often self-limiting, but severe disease can result in tachycardia, diaphoresis, failure to thrive, hyperphagia, stridor (due to compressive goiter), and microcephaly (attributable to craniosynostosis).",

Moreover, as this infant's immunizations are reported to be up to date, she must have been vaccinated against influenza virus at 6 months of age. Since RSV lacks neuraminidase, oseltamivir is ineffective in the prevention or treatment of RSV bronchiolitis; in fact, it is thought to inhibit clearance of the virus.",

RSV prophylaxis provides passive immunization by neutralizing and inhibiting the fusion activity of RSV, which decreases viral replication. Nirsevimab is long acting, providing protection for 5 months, and is therefore typically administered during or just before RSV season. Palivizumab can be used as an alternative, but because it is short acting, this drug must be administered monthly during RSV season.\n\nTreatment of RSV bronchiolitis is primarily supportive, but ribavirin may be used in severely affected and/or immunosuppressed children.",

        "explanation_why": "Infection by hepatitis D virus (HDV) can be prevented by hepatitis B vaccination. On its own, HDV is “defective” and unable to cause disease. HDV requires the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for replication (viral complementation). HBsAg, a noninfectious glycoprotein, is the antigen used to make the hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B is spread through sexual activity, via needle sharing, or at birth from the mother to child.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently recommends that all infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth, and subsequently at 1–2 months and 6–18 months of age.",

The newborn is at the 10th percentile for length, 14th percentile for weight, and 3rd percentile for head circumference. Examination shows “punched-out” skin lesions on the scalp, cleft lip, and a small chin. The patient's feet have a convex plantar surface. Auscultation shows a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Some of her intestines protrude through the umbilicus, covered by a thin membranous sac.

Features in addition to those seen in this newborn include microphthalmia/anophthalmia, coloboma, low-set, malformed ears, polycystic kidney disease, and capillary hemangiomata. Approximately 80% of affected children have a congenital heart defect, as suspected in this newborn, whose heart murmur is consistent with a ventricular septal defect. Only supportive treatment is available for infants with trisomy 13, and the prognosis is usually very poor (only 11% of infants survive past 12 months of age).",

        "explanation_why": "Decreased hydrogen ion concentration in the renal collecting duct would not be expected in this patient. As a result of this neonate's vomiting, she is most likely hypovolemic with a contraction alkalosis. In cases of contraction alkalosis, aldosterone acts on the distal tubule to increase secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions in exchange for increased reabsorption of sodium ions. Therefore, she would be expected to have an increased, not decreased hydrogen ion concentration. Cystic fibrosis itself does not affect renal electrolyte concentrations because the CFTR protein is not expressed in the kidneys.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased chloride concentration in alveolar fluid is not expected in cases of cystic fibrosis. Chloride concentration in the alveolar fluid is established through the action of CFTR channels, which actively transport chloride ions into the alveoli. A defect of the CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis impairs the transport of chloride ions into the alveoli and leads to a decrease (not an increase) in alveolar chloride concentration. As a result of the diminished chloride transport, water molecules are not secreted and the resulting mucus is hyperviscous, leading to mucus plug formation.",

Instead, patients with (advanced) cystic fibrosis often present with signs and symptoms of malabsorption, including impaired absorption of vitamin D.

        "explanation_why": "An increase in bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic secretions occurs as a normal response to food intake; it would not be expected in cystic fibrosis. The defective CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis impairs the secretion of chloride, sodium, and bicarbonate ions from the pancreas, decreasing the water content of pancreatic secretions. In newborns with cystic fibrosis, decreased water content of pancreatic secretions contributes to the development of recalcitrant meconium. As patients with this condition age, the hyperviscous pancreatic secretions lead to sclerosis of the pancreatic ducts and, ultimately, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased sodium concentration in sweat is a result of impaired chloride ion transport; chloride transport is mediated by the CFTR channel and the gene for this channel is mutated in cystic fibrosis. In the most common CFTR gene mutation, the membrane transporter misfolds, causing it to be retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, chloride is not properly reabsorbed and remains in the lumen of the apocrine sweat gland. Positively charged sodium ions are also pathologically trapped in sweat by the negatively charged chloride ions in order to balance the net electric charge, resulting in hypertonic sweat.\n\nLevels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) are measured as part of neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis. Elevated levels of IRT in heel-prick blood indicate that it has not been converted to its active form (trypsin), as a result of impaired release of pancreatic enzymes.",

The etiology is not yet fully understood, but risk factors include breech presentation, female sex, and a family history of DDH. Most cases of DDH involve the left hip. Physical examination typically shows leg length discrepancy, hip instability, limited or asymmetrical hip abduction, asymmetrical gluteal folds, and a positive Galeazzi sign.\n\nEarly detection of DDH is important, as the prognosis worsens with increasing age. Hip ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice in all infants younger than 4 months of age. A harness is the treatment of choice for infants with DDH who are younger than 6 months of age.",

They typically have rapid proliferation during the first few weeks of life followed by slow spontaneous involution (70% of IHs involute by 7 years of age). In the vast majority of cases, it is sufficient to reassure the parents and regularly examine the hemangioma to monitor for complications. Treatment (e.g., propranolol therapy, cryotherapy, laser therapy) is only indicated for hemangiomas that can cause functional impairment (e.g., periorbital region hemangiomas, airway hemangiomas) and in the rare case of complications (e.g., ulceration, disfigurement, noninvolution).",

Less commonly, the C7 nerve root is also involved, which results in flexion of the wrist and fingers, as seen in this patient. Erb palsy is typically caused by excessive lateral traction on the fetal head during complex obstetric maneuvers, which are often required to deliver fetuses with macrosomia (which, in this patient, was most likely caused by maternal diabetes). Most cases of Erb palsy resolve spontaneously within the first year of life with conservative management (e.g., immobilization, splinting, and physical therapy); surgical intervention is considered when functional impairment does not improve.\n\nThis neonate also has caput succedaneum, an area of fluctuance on the head that crosses suture lines, as a result of prolonged engagement of the fetal head during delivery.",

Additional manifestations of Klumpke palsy include Horner syndrome (due to the approximation of the sympathetic chain to the T1 nerve root) and the development of muscular atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles, which can lead to a “claw hand” deformity.",

As a confirmatory test, fetal ultrasound will show free-floating bowel without a membranous sac. Risk factors include young maternal age (i.e., under 20 years of age), and tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy.

Risk factors for this condition include fetal macrosomia, maternal obesity, and maternal diabetes mellitus, all of which are present here. However, most cases of shoulder dystocia occur in the absence of identifiable risk factors and are therefore difficult to prevent. Shoulder dystocia puts the newborn at risk of clavicle or humerus fractures, transient or permanent brachial plexus injuries such as Erb palsy (or, less frequently, Klumpke palsy), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to umbilical cord compression. Hemorrhage due to uterine atony/rupture and perineal lacerations are the most common maternal complications associated with shoulder dystocia. Treatment includes obstetrical maneuvers (e.g., McRobert maneuver) and, as a last resort, fracture of the fetal clavicle, Zavanelli maneuver, or symphysiotomy.",

Delivery was complicated by a prolonged second stage of labor and vacuum extraction was performed. He appears lethargic. Physical examination shows yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. There is a swelling in the occipital region. His total serum bilirubin concentration is 21.5 mg/dL. The newborn is placed in an incubator with a non-UV, blue-green light. Two days later, his total serum bilirubin concentration is within the reference range. Which of the following processes best explains the decrease of this newborn's total bilirubin concentration?",

            "description": "(1) Hemoglobin is broken down into heme and globin in the spleen and, to a lesser extent, in the bone marrow.\n(2) Macrophages break heme down into unconjugated bilirubin. Bound to albumin, unconjugated bilirubin is transported in the bloodstream and taken up by the liver.\n(3) Bilirubin is conjugated in the liver and secreted in bile.\n(4) In order to be secreted, conjugated bilirubin enters the blood to reach the hepatocytes with a direct connection to the bile canaliculi. At this stage, conjugated bilirubin is detectable in the blood.\n(5) Bilirubin reaches the intestine via the bile. Intestinal bacteria convert bilirubin to urobilinogen.\n(6) Most of the urobilinogen is converted into stercobilinogen and then stercobilin. Stercobilin is excreted via the stool, giving it its characteristic brown color.\n(7) A smaller portion of urobilinogen is reabsorbed and follows two different paths:\n→ (8) Most of it undergoes hepatobiliary recirculation, while the rest is filtrated in the kidney.\n→ Or: (9) The remainder gets filtrated in the kidneys. in the urine, urobilinogen is oxidized to urobilin, which is responsible for the characteristic yellow color.",

        "explanation_why": "In the type of phototherapy used to treat neonatal jaundice, 420–480 nm light is utilized to convert unconjugated, water-insoluble bilirubin (4Z,15Z-bilirubin) in the skin to water-soluble isomers (e.g., Z-lumirubin, 4Z,15E-bilirubin), which can be eliminated in urine and/or bile without being conjugated by the liver. Photoisomerization is the primary mechanism for the elimination of unconjugated bilirubin during phototherapy. Phototherapy is indicated for newborns with severe unconjugated bilirubinemia because unconjugated bilirubin is lipophilic and can cross the immature blood-brain barrier of newborns, leading to kernicterus. Newborns undergoing phototherapy must receive eye protection to prevent retinal degeneration from bright light, and adequate fluid supplementation to prevent dehydration.",

In newborns, UDP-GT activity is low and does not contribute significantly to the elimination of bilirubin. Phototherapy is required to mitigate low UDP-GT activity, as seen here, but it does not induce glucuronidation.",

Today, he weighs 2900 g (6 lb 6 oz). Physical examination shows dry skin and mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and a sunken anterior fontanelle. During the examination, he cries without tears. Laboratory studies show a serum osmolality of 305 mOsmol/kg H_2O and a urine osmolality of 45 mOsmol/kg H_2O. After the administration of a vasopressin analog, urine osmolality remains decreased. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this newborn's condition?",

However, in central DI, urine osmolality would increase following the administration of a vasopressin analog. Instead, this patient has nephrogenic DI (renal resistance to vasopressin), as evidenced by the failed desmopressin trial (i.e., failure of urine osmolality to increase following the administration of desmopressin). Desmopressin has, therefore, already been proven ineffective.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Indomethacin is used to treat nephrogenic DI because of its ability to inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis, which promotes the action of ADH on the collecting ducts, resulting in decreased diuresis. This male newborn has hereditary nephrogenic DI, most commonly caused by an X-linked mutation in the vasopressin V_2 receptor gene (AVPR2), which results in the failure of principal cells to respond to vasopressin (ADH). Females with a heterozygous mutation are typically asymptomatic because of the presence of a functional gene and lyonization of the mutated gene. However, they may develop polyuria during pregnancy, as seen in this neonate's mother, because of increased clearance of vasopressin by placental vasopressinase. In contrast, males with the mutation present with severe symptoms soon after birth.\n\nOther therapeutic measures to treat nephrogenic DI are adequate hydration, dietary salt and protein restriction (to prevent solute diuresis), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) therapy. Although HCTZ is a diuretic, in patients with nephrogenic DI it paradoxically decreases urine volume by an incompletely understood mechanism.",

        "explanation_why": "Avoiding the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products reduces the risk of contracting Listeria monocytogenes, which can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and increase the risk of stillbirth. However, L. monocytogenes infection in the fetus would typically cause abscess and granulomas of multiple organs including the skin (granulomatosis infantiseptica), which has not been reported here. Moreover, L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacillus, not a virus. Infection with the virus that caused this fetus's condition could not have been prevented by avoiding unpasteurized dairy products.",

Unlike other arboviruses that are only transmitted by an arthropod vector, the Zika virus can also be sexually transmitted. The patient's husband most likely acquired the infection during his travel to an endemic region and subsequently transmitted it to the patient via sexual intercourse. Most patients with Zika virus infection remain asymptomatic. However, in pregnant women, Zika virus can be transmitted transplacentally to the fetus and cause microcephaly and/or stillbirth, as seen here. Individuals who have traveled to endemic regions should use barrier contraception or abstain from sex for at least 2 months for women and 3 months for men (the virus persists in semen for a longer period of time). In the case of pregnancy, both partners should use contraception or abstain from sex for the entire pregnancy.",

Yellow fever virus, which is a mosquito-borne flavivirus endemic to South America, can be prevented by vaccination but yellow fever manifests with hemorrhagic fever, and vertical transmission to the fetus is rare. Moreover, yellow fever can only be contracted by traveling to the endemic region; the patient's husband, not the patient, traveled to an endemic region. Congenital rubella, a TORCH infection that can cause stillbirth and microcephaly, can be prevented with MMR vaccination but the rubella virus is a togavirus, not a flavivirus.

Accordingly, the hernial sac is formed by the amniotic membrane and peritoneum, and the umbilical cord lies at the apex of the hernia.Gastroschisis: a developmental defect of the anterior abdominal wall in the paraumbilical region through which intraabdominal contents prolapse. As it is the anterior abdominal wall that fails to develop correctly, there is no outer peritoneal or membranous covering.Congenital umbilical hernia: herniation of intraabdominal contents through a patent umbilical orifice, which typically closes by 2 years of age. The sac of a paraumbilical hernia is the peritoneum.Diastasis recti: an abnormally wide separation of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles. The abdominal fascia are intact. There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up).",

    "question_text": "A 4-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of nasal discharge and cough. He was born at 39 weeks' gestation to a 23-year-old woman gravida 1, para 1, after an uncomplicated delivery. Two weeks ago, his mother noticed a “thick yellow-green discharge” from his left eye that was treated at home with teabag compressions. The mother has no medical insurance and did not receive prenatal care. The patient appears irritable. He is at the 50th percentile for length and weight. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 65/min, and blood pressure is 80/55 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Physical examination shows short, repetitive episodes of cough with brief inspirations between each cough. Bilateral, diffuse crackles are heard on auscultation of the chest. There is mild swelling of the left eyelid. Polymerase chain reaction tests of nasopharyngeal and ocular secretions are positive for the same pathogen. Which of the following is the most likely causal microorganism?",

He was born at 39 weeks' gestation to a 23-year-old woman gravida 1, para 1, after an uncomplicated delivery. Two weeks ago, his mother noticed a “thick yellow-green discharge” from his left eye that was treated at home with teabag compressions. The mother has no medical insurance and did not receive prenatal care. The patient appears irritable. He is at the 50th percentile for length and weight. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 65/min, and blood pressure is 80/55 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Physical examination shows short, repetitive episodes of cough with brief inspirations between each cough. Bilateral, diffuse crackles are heard on auscultation of the chest. There is mild swelling of the left eyelid. Polymerase chain reaction tests of nasopharyngeal and ocular secretions are positive for the same pathogen. Which of the following is the most likely causal microorganism?",

    "hint": "This patient developed neonatal conjunctivitis and now presents with nasal congestion and features of pneumonia (tachypnea, hypoxemia, cough, and crackles on auscultation). Eosinophilia on a complete blood count is a relatively specific diagnostic clue for this newborn's condition, which could most likely have been prevented with adequate prenatal care.",

In addition to neonatal conjunctivitis, N. gonorrhea infection can cause disseminated gonococcal infection and septic arthritis, but not pneumonia.",

        "explanation_why": "Atrial septal defects (ASD) manifest with a pulmonary flow murmur (systolic ejection murmur) heard best at the left upper sternal border and are often associated with fixed splitting of S2. ASDs are often low-velocity shunts that produce insufficient flow to be audible. Larger shunts may cause diastolic flow murmurs across the tricuspid valve owing to a large left-to-right shunt. However, the continuous machinery murmur would not be seen in patients with an ASD.",

Accentuated and bounding peripheral pulses might also be present.

The murmur can decrease in intensity as the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction worsens because of increased right-to-left shunting of blood.

        "explanation_why": "The murmur of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is generated as blood continuously shunts from the high-pressure aorta through the ductus arteriosus into the low-pressure pulmonary artery. It may envelop the S_2 and is not usually affected by positional changes. Patients with moderate-sized PDAs may present with bounding pulses, widened pulse pressure, and symptoms of heart failure.\n\nThis condition affects infants who are born prematurely and/or have congenital rubella infection (CRI). CRI is likely in this newborn given that the mother had features of rubella infection (e.g., an erythematous exanthem that began on the face, polyarthritis). The most common congenital heart defects associated with CRI are PDA and pulmonary stenosis. Pulmonary stenosis causes a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.",

He was delivered at 35 weeks' gestation because of premature rupture of membranes. Apgar scores were 8 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. His parents refused prenatal screening. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 146/min, respirations are 51/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa. Crackles are heard throughout both lung bases. There is a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border. Insertion of a nasogastric tube is attempted but the tube cannot be passed beyond 6 cm from the gums. An x-ray with contrast shows a blind-ended esophageal pouch; there is abundant gas in the stomach. Screening for which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Coughing and choking spells when feeding, in conjunction with cyanosis, crackles on lung auscultation, and the inability to pass a feeding tube, suggest esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). This diagnosis is confirmed by the x-ray findings. The harsh systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation suggests a cardiac structural anomaly.",

About 50% of esophageal atresia cases are associated with other mesodermal defects, known as the VACTERL association: Vertebral anomaly, Anal atresia, Cardiac anomaly, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Renal anomaly (including agenesis), and Limb malformation. Newborns with esophageal atresia should, therefore, undergo screening for other VACTERL anomalies. Screening typically includes echocardiography and renal ultrasonography.\n\nEsophageal atresia with TEF to the distal esophageal segment is the most common type of esophageal atresia, accounting for > 75% of cases. A fetus with esophageal atresia is unable to swallow amniotic fluid, resulting in polyhydramnios, which can lead to premature rupture of membranes and premature labor, as seen here.",

However, transvaginal transmission mostly occurs in mothers with genital herpes; chorioamnionitis and PPROM are not typical of maternal HSV infection. Infected infants usually also have characteristic diffuse vesicular skin lesions and may develop keratoconjunctivitis. Finally, CNS disease generally manifests in the second or third week of life rather than 3 days after birth.",

Congenital toxoplasmosis may cause premature birth and manifest with fever, seizures, pneumonitis, and hepatomegaly. However, infected mothers are usually asymptomatic or develop a mononucleosis-like disease during pregnancy; chorioamnionitis and PPROM are not typical. The severity of congenital disease decreases with gestational age: while first-trimester infection usually results in a classic triad (chorioretinitis, diffuse intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus) and other nonspecific features (e.g., blueberry muffin rash, jaundice, macrocephaly), second- or third-trimester infections are mostly subclinical or mild.

        "explanation_why": "Consumption of unpasteurized milk products is a risk factor for listeriosis, which typically manifests with self-limiting gastroenteritis in healthy adults. In pregnant women, however, listeriosis can cause complications (e.g., fever, chorioamnionitis, PPROM) and result in preterm birth or spontaneous abortion. Transmission from an infected mother to the fetus can either occur transplacentally or via direct contact with infected vaginal secretions and/or blood during delivery. This patient likely has early-onset neonatal listeriosis (granulomatosis infantiseptica), manifesting with severe systemic infection and disseminated organ involvement (i.e., of the liver and lungs). Signs of meningitis (e.g., fever, seizures, hypotonia, abnormal cerebral ultrasound) may develop as early as seen here, especially in preterm neonates, or have a delayed onset in the 3 weeks after birth, typically in full-term neonates with perinatal infection.

However, this patient's mother reports no features of present or past syphilis. Moreover, while fetal syphilis may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or hydrops fetalis, chorioamnionitis or PPROM are not typical. The majority of newborns with congenital syphilis are asymptomatic at birth; symptoms of early congenital syphilis (e.g., jaundice, rhinorrhea, maculopapular rash on the palms and soles, skeletal abnormalities, lymphadenopathy) and, rarely, syphilitic leptomeningitis develop over several months.

        "explanation_why": "Preterm newborns like this patient are particularly susceptible to postnatal transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV; e.g., through breast milk from an infected mother), and neonatal CMV infection can manifest with fever, seizures, hypotonia, hepatomegaly, pneumonitis, and sepsis. However, CMV infection during pregnancy generally manifests with nonspecific flu-like symptoms rather than chorioamnionitis and PPROM, and transmission is primarily transplacental. At birth, 90% of infected infants are asymptomatic, and those that develop symptoms often also present with a blueberry muffin rash, jaundice, small size for gestational age, microcephaly, and sensorineural hearing loss. Neuroimaging characteristically shows periventricular calcifications and hydrocephalus rather than diffuse hyperechogenicity.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Features of heart failure (e.g., irritability, poor feeding, failure to thrive) with a continuous murmur in the left infraclavicular region are highly suggestive of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), for which premature birth is a risk factor. The echocardiography findings confirm the diagnosis.",

Prostaglandins keep the ductus arteriosus patent, and by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin production and thus promote ductal closure. NSAIDs are only effective in preterm infants.\n\nTranscatheter or surgical closure is the treatment of choice for infants ≥ 6 kg, children, and adults. In preterm infants, procedural closure is generally only used if pharmacological treatment is unsuccessful.",

        "explanation_why": "Bilateral choanal atresia, a congenital condition characterized by complete blockage of the nasal cavity, typically manifests immediately after birth with respiratory distress, grunting breath sounds, and central cyanosis which improves with crying and worsens with feeding and at rest. The best initial test is the passage of a catheter through the nares, which is not possible in bilateral choanal atresia. Contrast rhinography in the supine position or CT scan of the facial bones confirms the diagnosis. After establishing an oropharyngeal airway, transnasal endoscopic resection of the posterior nasal septum is the most appropriate treatment to provide a permanent nasal airway. These procedures help prevent life-threatening cyanotic attacks and aspiration when the newborn's mouth is blocked during feeding. Finally, the newborn should be examined for other congenital anomalies since choanal atresia is often associated with CHARGE syndrome.\n\nSplitting of the second heart sound, as seen in this newborn, occurs physiologically during inspiration, which leads to delayed closure of the pulmonary valve (P_2) due to increased right ventricular ejection time.",

This condition may manifest immediately after birth with respiratory distress and cyanotic attacks, similar to what is seen in this patient. Since newborns with EA are unable to swallow properly, excessive foamy secretions at the mouth would also be expected.

However, infants with TOF and episodic cyanosis (i.e., tet spells) typically have mild RVOTO and only become symptomatic at 2–4 months of age. In contrast, newborns with TOF and cyanosis immediately after birth usually have severe RVOTO with symptoms that do not fluctuate or improve with crying.

Apgar scores were 4 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Pregnancy and delivery were complicated by oligohydramnios and green amniotic fluid. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 175/min, and respirations are 65/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination shows nasal flaring, abdominal breathing, and substernal retractions. On pulmonary examination, diffuse crackles are heard bilaterally. An x-ray of the chest shows increased lung volumes and asymmetric, coarse opacities with bilateral effusions. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Meconium-stained amniotic fluid and respiratory distress immediately after birth suggest meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Postterm delivery, oligohydramnios, and cesarean delivery are risk factors for this condition.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Surfactant therapy is routinely administered in patients with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), which can manifest with signs of increased breathing effort (e.g., nasal flaring, substernal retractions, tachypnea) and hypoxia immediately after birth. However, chest x-ray findings would show diffuse, fine, reticulogranular opacities and decreased rather than increased lung volumes. Moreover, the major risk factor for NRDS is premature birth, while this patient was born at 42 weeks' gestation. This patient most likely has MAS, in which surfactant therapy might be indicated in mechanically ventilated patients but is not part of the initial management.",

        "explanation_why": "Indomethacin therapy is used to induce closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Although large PDAs can manifest with symptoms of respiratory distress (due to heart failure), these symptoms are not seen immediately after birth. Furthermore, PDA would manifest with a characteristic machine-like, loud continuous murmur on auscultation. This newborn most likely has MAS, in which indomethacin is not indicated.",

        "explanation_why": "Combination therapy with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin therapy is used in the treatment of early-onset neonatal pneumonia (i.e., within 6 days of birth), which manifests with features of respiratory distress (e.g., tachypnea, increased breathing effort, hypoxia) and asymmetrical, patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray, similar to what is seen here. Empiric antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin might also be indicated in newborns with MAS, as it is usually not possible to definitively rule out bacterial pneumonia. However, other steps in management (e.g., obtaining blood cultures) should be performed prior to initiating antibiotic therapy.",

        "explanation_why": "The most appropriate step in the management of a newborn with MAS is to provide supportive care, which includes the administration of supplemental oxygen. Aspirated meconium in the tracheobronchial system leads to airway obstruction, chemical irritation, inflammation, and surfactant inactivation, culminating in alveolar collapse. Alveolar collapse results in areas of atelectasis and consequently a right-to-left pulmonary shunt, leading to areas of ventilation/perfusion mismatch with hypoxia and consequent hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This can, in turn, lead to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The administration of supplemental oxygen counters pulmonary vasoconstriction, helping to prevent or reverse PPHN. The management of severe cases should follow the standard steps of neonatal resuscitation.",

Facial nerve palsy caused by forceps delivery usually resolves spontaneously after a few weeks, in which case it does not require further diagnostic workup. Treatment is symptomatic (e.g., artificial tears). Other neonatal complications of assisted vaginal delivery (forceps or vacuum delivery) include injuries to the skin and subcutaneous tissue (e.g., ecchymosis, lacerations), skull (e.g., fractures), and eye (e.g., retinal hemorrhage), as well as subgaleal or intracranial hemorrhage, and, in rare cases, fetal death. External ear trauma (e.g., abrasions, lacerations) is more common in forceps delivery, and cephalohematomas and brachial plexus injuries are more common in vacuum delivery.\n\nMaternal complications of assisted vaginal delivery include injuries to the genital tract (e.g., lacerations, hematomas), urinary tract (e.g., bladder or urethral injury), or anal sphincter (e.g., lacerations).",

Besides maternal age, maternal smoking and late or no prenatal care are the two other most important maternal risk factors associated with SIDS.

Risk factors can also be infant-related (e.g., prematurity, low birth weight, twins, history of apnea, history of sibling loss due to SIDS), pregnancy-related (e.g., placenta previa, placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes), or environmental (e.g., prone sleeping position, overheating, soft toys or blankets in the crib).",

However, rectal examination of patients with HD usually shows a tight anal sphincter, an empty rectal vault, and/or explosive expulsion of the feces after rectal examination (squirt sign). Moreover, HD would not cause macrocytic anemia, bradycardia, or hypothermia.",

If the mother has hypothyroidism, the manifestations of this condition can be apparent at birth, but they most commonly develop a few weeks to months insidiously after birth in the setting of maternal euthyroidism (because maternal T_4 can cross the placenta). Thyroid function tests (serum TSH and free T_4) are used to diagnose hypothyroidism and distinguish between primary and secondary hypothyroidism. The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency worldwide and thyroid dysgenesis in iodine-sufficient regions. Iodine deficiency is a common cause among patients from certain regions (e.g., Central Asia) but is extremely rare in the US due to the iodization of salt. Other causes of congenital hypothyroidism include transplacental transmission of maternal antithyroid antibodies and genetic defects in thyroid hormone synthesis or thyroid hormone receptors. If congenital hypothyroidism is left untreated, organomegaly (e.g., macroglossia, hepatomegaly), impaired skeletal maturation (e.g., delayed fontanelle closure), myxedema, intellectual disability, and/or heart failure can occur.",

Miliaria rubra is the most prevalent form of miliaria and manifests with a pruritic, papulovesicular, erythematous rash, typically on the intertriginous areas of the groin, axillae, and neck. Management of miliaria rubra consists of measures to reduce sweating and occlusion of eccrine glands, such as keeping the patient in a cool environment, wearing breathable clothing (e.g., cotton), lightly scrubbing the skin to remove debris that can clog sweat glands, and, if nonpharmacologic measures fail to reduce the rash, administering topical steroids to decrease inflammation.",

The episodes last 20–30 seconds and are accompanied by desaturation on pulse oximetry and bradycardia. She starts breathing again when the sole of her foot is tapped. She was delivered at 29 weeks' gestation to a 27-year-old woman and weighed 1100 g (2 lb 7 oz). Apgar scores were 6 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient was taken to a tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit immediately after delivery, where she has been monitored since in an incubator with free-flow oxygen. The newborn's skin appears pink. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 124/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 56/29 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Capillary refill time is less than 2 seconds. Cardiopulmonary examination and a chest x-ray show no abnormalities. The results of a complete blood count and serum studies are within normal limits. Blood culture and lumbar puncture results are pending. In addition to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Episodes of apnea that last > 20 seconds or that are accompanied by bradycardia and/or oxygen desaturation in an otherwise healthy premature neonate indicate apnea of prematurity (AOP). This condition occurs as a result of a combination of airflow obstruction at the nasopharyngeal level (obstructive apnea) and decreased respiratory drive (central apnea).",

        "explanation_why": "Few nonsevere episodes of AOP can be managed with supportive measures (e.g., maintaining a physiological neck position and appropriate incubator temperature, avoiding excessive nasal suctioning) as well as nasal CPAP to keep the upper airways open and improve oxygenation. This patient has had multiple episodes accompanied by desaturation and requires tactile stimulation to trigger spontaneous breathing. Therefore, additional therapy is indicated.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "AOP reflects immature respiratory control and is commonly seen in preterm neonates or neonates with very low birth weight, with the incidence inversely proportional to the gestational age. AOP typically manifests during the first few days after birth and is diagnosed clinically. Management includes supportive measures such as maintaining a physiological neck position, appropriate incubator temperature, and avoidance of excessive nasal suctioning. Other causes of apnea (e.g., sepsis) should also be ruled out. Additionally, nasal CPAP is indicated in all infants with AOP to keep the upper airways open and to improve oxygenation by improving the ventilation-perfusion ratio. Methylxanthines, such as caffeine, are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment and stimulate respiration, presumably by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine therapy is the preferred drug and is indicated in patients with recurrent episodes who require tactile stimulation (e.g., tapping the sole of the foot) to trigger spontaneous breathing, or if ventilatory support is necessary.\n\nGiven the high likelihood of developing AOP, caffeine can be administered prophylactically to neonates who are extremely preterm (< 28 weeks' gestation) or have an extremely low birth weight (< 1000 g).",

Although premature neonates have a high risk of NRDS, this patient does not have features that suggest this condition, such as tachypnea, grunting, or nasal flaring. Furthermore, typical findings of NRDS include diffuse ground-glass densities and air bronchograms seen on chest x-ray as well as diminished breath sounds on auscultation. Surfactant therapy has no role in the treatment of AOP.",

All neonates have GERD to some extent because of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. The gastric fluid stimulates the laryngeal chemoreflex response, which is overactive in preterm neonates, resulting in apnea. Although apnea and desaturation may be symptoms of GERD, poor weight gain and feeding intolerance are also expected findings.",

He was born at term to a 26-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, following an uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother's first pregnancy ended in stillbirth with hydrops fetalis at 35 weeks' gestation. She did not receive prenatal care during either pregnancy and refused postnatal screening after the first pregnancy. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She lives in Pennsylvania and there is no history of international travel. The newborn appears pale and lethargic. He is at the 10th percentile for length, weight, and head circumference. He does not move his extremities spontaneously. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and jaundice. His spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin.

        "explanation_why": "Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is an autosomal recessive enzyme defect of the glycolytic pathway that results in extravascular hemolytic anemia. It is the second most prevalent erythrocyte enzyme disorder (after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency). A higher incidence has been observed within Pennsylvania Amish communities, most likely as a result of the founder effect. The severity of the disease is highly variable; PKD can manifest with fetal demise due to hydrops fetalis, symptomatic anemia from birth that requires lifelong transfusions, or chronic compensated hemolysis. A peripheral blood smear typically shows normal erythrocyte morphology, but echinocytes are sometimes seen. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring pyruvate kinase enzyme activity.",

Atopic dermatitis can manifest in infancy with an erythematous rash on the face but more commonly results in scaly, eczematous plaques without pustules. In addition, these lesions are often intensely pruritic and cause discomfort and irritability. Topical tacrolimus is not used to treat neonatal cephalic pustulosis.",

CMN typically manifests as a light to darkly pigmented, smooth, well-circumscribed macule or patch that gradually becomes elevated with a rough surface and irregular pigmentation as the patient gets older. Hair growth on the lesion may be present at birth or develop later as the nevus grows. Because CMN, especially large nevi, are at risk of progressing to malignancy, all patients should be monitored regularly. Surgical excision or laser ablation (depending on the type and size of the lesion) may be performed, particularly for large or giant lesions.",

Other harmful side effects of ACE inhibitors, when taken after the first trimester, include oligohydramnios and its complications (e.g., intrauterine growth restriction, Potter sequence), poor cranial ossification (e.g., hypocalvaria), and fetal death. ACE inhibitors are also associated with cardiovascular and CNS malformations when taken during the first trimester. Therefore, ACE inhibitors should be avoided during pregnancy. Pregnant patients with new or existing hypertension should be treated with an antihypertensive that is safe for use during pregnancy (e.g. methyldopa). Renal hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, and IUGR can already be detected during prenatal ultrasonography.\n\nA healthy newborn must pass urine within 24 hours of birth. Other causes of fetal renal hypoplasia include environmental factors (e.g., maternal nutritional deficiencies, maternal diabetes).",

She was born at 35 weeks following an uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. She was exclusively breastfed and has recently been introduced to solid foods. She has no history of similar episodes and is otherwise healthy. Vaccinations are up-to-date. She is at the 50^th percentile for length and weight and at the 75^th percentile for head circumference. Development is appropriate for age. She is alert and appears well. Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 38/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. ECG shows a regular sinus rhythm and no acute abnormalities.

No further evaluation is warranted for patients with a low-risk BRUE. Caregivers should be provided with reassurance, education, and CPR training. BRUE is a diagnosis of exclusion; an underlying condition is the actual cause of the episode in about half of infants who present with features of BRUE. Patients who do not meet all of the criteria for low-risk BRUE are considered high risk and should be evaluated for underlying causes. When no cause can be established, prolonged hospital admission for monitoring may be required.",

        "explanation_why": "Breastfeeding jaundice is caused by insufficient breast milk intake and manifests with indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first week of life. However, newborns with breastfeeding jaundice usually also have a history of oliguria (e.g., few wet diapers) and weight loss. This newborn has already surpassed her birth weight and the mother reports breastfeeding her frequently without difficulty, making insufficient breastfeeding an unlikely cause of her jaundice. In this newborn, breast milk jaundice rather than breastfeeding jaundice is likely a contributing factor.",

In addition, laboratory studies in patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome show direct hyperbilirubinemia caused by defective excretion of conjugated bilirubin, not the indirect hyperbilirubinemia seen in this newborn.",

        "explanation_why": "Physiological neonatal jaundice is a common condition that manifests between the second and the eighth day of life with jaundice and mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia in an otherwise healthy newborn. This condition is caused by several components of bilirubin metabolism in newborns, including immaturity of the pathways for hepatic conjugation and elimination (due to decreased activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), the short life span of erythrocytes in newborns, and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin (due to low bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and certain breast milk components). Exclusively breastfed newborns are more likely to develop physiological neonatal jaundice. Treatment of neonatal jaundice by phototherapy is indicated if bilirubin levels increase above a defined threshold.",

Although this newborn's incompatibility with her mother's Rhesus type puts her at risk for HDFN, her normal hemoglobin and low reticulocyte count make hemolysis unlikely.",

This disease typically results in mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia and neonatal jaundice. ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn usually becomes evident, however, within the first 24 hours of life and almost exclusively occurs in newborns with blood type A or B whose mother's blood type is O. Since this newborn's blood type is O, her erythrocytes do not express AB antigens that could be bound by maternal antibodies.

Her parents also report that she has recently started having trouble feeding herself and appears to be losing interest in playing. She was born at full term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and her early development was within normal limits. Family history is notable for a paternal aunt who had a progressive neurological disorder and died in her early 20s. On examination, the girl is listless and has difficulty following commands. She has poor head control and generalized hypotonia. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished in all four extremities. Funduscopic examination reveals bilateral optic atrophy. Nerve conduction studies show symmetrically decreased conduction velocities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Symptoms typically appear at 3–6 months of age and include developmental delay, hypotonia, and characteristic ophthalmological findings. In TSD, however, the hallmark ocular feature is a cherry-red spot on the macula, not optic nerve atrophy, and patients have hyperreflexia rather than hyporeflexia. Peripheral neuropathy and decreased nerve conduction velocity are not features of TSD. Additionally, this patient does not have other expected manifestations of TSD, such as hyperacusis and seizures.",

This leads to progressive demyelination in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Childhood onset is characterized by psychomotor regression, impaired memory, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, ataxia, and optic nerve atrophy that can lead to vision loss. Nerve conduction studies reveal decreased velocities due to demyelination. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is diagnosed by finding deficient ARSA enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes or dried blood spots, and/or by identifying pathogenic mutations in the ARSA gene. A positive family history of progressive neurological decline supports the diagnosis of genetic leukodystrophy.",
