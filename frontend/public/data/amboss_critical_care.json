        "explanation_why": "In HUS, endothelial dysfunction leads to the formation of microthrombi in the arterioles and capillaries, especially in the kidney, where it can precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI). Erythrocytes and platelets also undergo mechanical damage as they pass through the microcirculation, as seen in the schistocytes on peripheral smear. Platelet dysfunction manifests as increased bleeding time as a result both of the resultant thrombocytopenia and the negative effects of uremia on platelet function from AKI. PT and PTT are typically normal but may be slightly elevated.",

This constellation of findings can also be seen in liver cirrhosis, although typically there is concurrent thrombocytopenia with resultant increased bleeding time in advanced cirrhosis.

        "explanation_why": "Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is produced in the hypothalamus (supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus). This hormone is then stored in, and subsequently released by, the posterior pituitary gland. Ischemia or direct damage (e.g., major surgery or head trauma) to the pituitary gland can affect ADH secretion and cause transient central DI. Features of central DI include polyuria, polydipsia, and increased serum osmolality in the presence of low urine osmolality. In the majority of cases, patients recover the ability to maintain serum osmolality, and ADH secretion is restored.",

            "description": "The binding of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to V2 receptors (R) promotes the insertion of aquaporin-2 channels into the apical cell membranes of principal cells in the renal collecting duct, thereby facilitating free water reabsorption and concentration of urine.In diabetes insipidus (DI), this mechanism is impaired either due to reduced pituitary ADH secretion (central DI) or defective renal ADH receptors (nephrogenic DI), in both cases reducing the insertion of aquaporin-2 channels. This impairs the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine and results in the production of large amounts of dilute urine (up to 15 L/day).",

    "hint": "This patient initially had respiratory alkalosis on admission. The significant decrease in pH in combination with the decrease in HCO_3^- and an elevated anion gap (20 mEq/L) three hours later suggests metabolic acidosis. Since this patient's PaCO_2 (31 mm Hg) is lower than would be expected from normal respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis (35 mm Hg ± 2 according to Winter's formula), this patient most likely has a mixed acid-base disorder.",

In early toxicity, salicylates directly stimulate the medullary respiratory center and cause tachypnea and hyperpnea, both of which manifest with respiratory alkalosis. Later, the accumulation of organic acids (due to salicylates inhibiting citric acid cycle enzymes) causes a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, which leads to a mixed acid-base disorder. Features of salicylate toxicity include tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, hyperthermia (due to uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation), pulmonary edema, seizures, and, ultimately, coma.",

Although this patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory acidosis due to an opioid overdose, there is, however, no history to suggest an additional metabolic alkalosis (e.g., diuretic use, severe vomiting).\n\nThe measured HCO_3^- is within the range of the expected HCO_3^- for a single chronic respiratory acidosis (24 + [0.4 x (pCO_2  in mm Hg - 40)] +/- 3 = 33–39 mEq/L) but the acute nature of an opioid overdose makes chronic respiratory acidosis unlikely.",

Decreased pH indicates acidosis, increased pCO_2 suggests a respiratory source and, due to the acute nature of an opioid overdose, only minimal metabolic compensation from the rapid action of buffers in blood would be expected. In acute respiratory acidosis, for every 10 mm Hg increase in pCO_2 above 40 mm Hg, the HCO_3^- concentration increases by 1 mEq/L from 24 mEq/L with an expected variability of +/- 3 mEq/L. A slow-onset but more substantial compensation occurs as a result of renal acid-base handling in chronic respiratory acid-base disorders.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for acute respiratory acidosis in the emergency department setting include airway obstruction (e.g., foreign body aspiration, acute exacerbations of obstructive lung diseases), neuromuscular etiologies (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic crisis, botulism), and overdoses with other drugs that can cause CNS depression (e.g., benzodiazepines).",

Therefore, flumazenil is only used to treat benzodiazepine toxicity in patients who are benzodiazepine-naive (e.g., accidental ingestion in children, reversal of toxicity from procedural sedation) or have severe respiratory depression. Note that benzodiazepine toxicity very rarely leads to severe respiratory depression unless associated with the coingestion of other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, barbiturates, and first-generation antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine).",

To maintain tissue perfusion, there is compensatory tachycardia and an increase in SVR. Despite these responses, there is an overall decrease in CVP, PCWP, and reduced stroke volume and cardiac output. On physical examination, these patients typically have cold and clammy skin.

Although this patient has features suggestive of septic shock, the presence of warm skin is not consistent with the decreased cardiac output seen in the late stage of septic shock; in the late stage, cold, pale skin is expected. This profile can also be consistent with neurogenic shock, which is a form of distributive shock that manifests with vasodilation and reduced SVR, as well as relative bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. Without a history or evidence of significant head, neck, or spine trauma, this cause is very unlikely to explain the patient's presentation.",

It is generally characterized either as obstructive shock (due to cardiac tamponade, massive pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, etc.) or nonobstructive shock (due to acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, etc.). In response to the decrease in cardiac output, there is an increase in SVR. Poor forward flow leads to increases in PCWP and CVP. In cardiogenic shock, patients typically have cold, clammy skin on examination. This patient has no history or examination findings that suggest a cardiogenic cause of his presentation.",

        "explanation_why": "This profile suggests distributive shock, which is a collective term for shock that results in pathologic vasodilation, leading to decreased SVR. The most common cause is septic shock (in this case likely due to urinary tract infection), but it can also be caused by neurogenic shock or anaphylactic shock. Circulating cytokines and bacterial toxins cause pathologic vasodilation and lead to decreased SVR (afterload), as well as decreased CVP and PCWP (preload). Consequently, there is an increase in heart rate aimed at increasing cardiac output. Patients with septic shock often have warm, flushed skin as a result of this pathophysiology. In the late stage of septic shock, there may be a decrease in cardiac output; therefore, patients may present with cold, pale skin with a delayed capillary refill (see “Overview of the types of shock” table).\n\nThe most important initial steps in the management of septic shock are measurement of serum lactate, early administration of empiric antibiotic therapy after blood cultures have been obtained, aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids, and additional vasopressor therapy in patients who are refractory to intravenous fluid management (hour-1 bundle for sepsis).",

First-line therapies for HAE focus on antagonizing the bradykinin B2 receptor (icatibant), replacing the defective enzyme with intravenous injection of purified C1-INH, or preventing further generation of bradykinin with a kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide).\n\nTrauma, dental work, and mental or physical stress are common triggers for these acute attacks.",

If hypoglycemia is not present at the time of evaluation, a 72-hour fasting test can be conducted to reproduce hypoglycemic symptoms and reach a definitive diagnosis. Glucose and hypoglycemic studies, including measurement of insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and β-hydroxybutyrate, should be obtained at the beginning of the test and then repeated every 6 hours until the serum glucose falls below 60 mg/dL. C-peptide and proinsulin are measures of the endogenous production of insulin and are decreased in hypoglycemia; hypoglycemia with elevated C-peptide and proinsulin levels should raise concern for insulinoma.",

In conjunction with his history of long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension, these findings indicate pulmonary edema due to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). As this patient is hemodynamically stable, management includes oxygen supplementation, proper positioning (raising the head of the bed), and intravenous loop diuretics such as furosemide. Diuresis results in a decrease in intravascular volume, thereby reducing the cardiac preload, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which, in turn, reduces pulmonary edema. Furthermore, in patients with pulmonary edema, furosemide causes transient venodilation, further reducing pulmonary congestion, even before the onset of diuresis. If respiratory distress persists, treatment with vasodilators for ADHF (e.g., nitroglycerin) may be initiated to further reduce preload.\n\nFor the appropriate management of ADHF, think LMNOP: Loop diuretics (furosemide), Modify medications, Nitrates, Oxygen if hypoxic, Position (with elevated upper body).",

Her pulse is 132/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 88/52 mm Hg. She is at the 72^nd percentile for height (125 cm) and the 70^th percentile for weight (25 kg). Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Examination shows erythematous burn wounds with fluid-filled vesicles and bullae that cover 30% of the body surface area. The burn wounds blanch on applying pressure. There is mild stridor heard at the lung bases bilaterally. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There is no pharyngeal edema or soot in the nostrils. Peripheral pulses are palpable bilaterally. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation with 40% oxygen is begun. Urinary catheterization is performed. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Two large-bore intravenous catheters are inserted and fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution is begun. In addition to fluid resuscitation for replacement of ongoing fluid loss, which of the following is the most appropriate maintenance fluid resuscitation regimen?",

Her pulse is 132/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 88/52 mm Hg. She is at the 72nd percentile for height (125 cm) and the 70th percentile for weight (25 kg). Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Examination shows erythematous burn wounds with fluid-filled vesicles and bullae that cover 30% of the body surface area. The burn wounds blanch on applying pressure. There is mild stridor heard at the lung bases bilaterally. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There is no pharyngeal edema or soot in the nostrils. Peripheral pulses are palpable bilaterally. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation with 40% oxygen is begun. Urinary catheterization is performed. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Two large-bore intravenous catheters are inserted and fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution is begun. In addition to fluid resuscitation for replacement of ongoing fluid loss, which of the following is the most appropriate maintenance fluid resuscitation regimen?",
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "This child with second-degree burns that cover 30% of the total body surface area needs urgent fluid resuscitation, preferably with a balanced electrolyte solution. In pediatric burn patients, the amount of fluid that has to be administered over the first 24 hours is calculated as follows: 3 mL × % total body surface area affected by nonsuperficial burns × body weight. In addition, all children < 30 kg should receive maintenance fluids according to the 4-2-1 rule (4 mL/kg/h for the first 10 kg + 2 mL/kg/h for the next 10 kg + 1 mL/kg/h for the remaining weight).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) is the crystalloid of choice for fluid resuscitation and replacement of ongoing losses in burn patients because it closely resembles extracellular fluid. The lactate in LR also reduces the incidence of metabolic acidosis. The formula used to estimate the daily fluid requirement for the replacement of ongoing fluid loss in this 25 kg child < 14 years old with 30% second-degree burns is: 2250 mL (3 mL x 30 x 25 = 2250 mL) during the first 24 hours. Children < 30 kg should receive an additional sugar-containing solution. Using the 4-2-1 formula, the maintenance rate for this solution is: 65 mL/h (4 x 10 = 40 mL/h + 2 x 10 = 20 mL/h + 1 x 5 = 5 mL/h = 65 mL/h). Therefore, this patient should receive maintenance fluid resuscitation with 5% dextrose in LR at a rate of 65 mL/h.",

Blood pressure is therefore underestimated. If more fluid were administered to the patient based on a misinterpretation of blood pressure, edema in the limb would worsen, and the risk of pulmonary edema would increase. Also, blood pressure may be normal despite decreased intravascular fluid volume and end-organ perfusion in a patient with an intact vasomotor response and would only begin to decrease once shock sets in. Even intraarterial manometry may be unreliable because of peripheral vasoconstriction by stress hormones (e.g., catecholamines).",

Maintaining organ perfusion is the primary goal of IV fluid therapy in burn patients. Initially, the approximate volume of fluid required may be estimated (e.g., based on the total body surface area involved), however, this is merely a starting point, and IV fluid volume should be titrated to maintain a urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/h in adults (1 mL/kg/h in children). Although heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored in patients with burns, these parameters are not good indicators of overall organ perfusion. If urine output falls below 0.5 mL/kg/h, a 500–1000 mL bolus of crystalloid fluid should be given, and the maintenance infusion rate should be increased by 20–30%.",

Insulin deficiency triggers lipolysis, which generates free fatty acids that become ketones, resulting in a high anion gap 135 mEq/L- (98 mEq/L + 9 mEq/L) = 28 mEq/L). The primary acid-base disturbance in DKA is metabolic acidosis and patients, therefore, develop acidemia with decreased bicarbonate. Winter formula, i.e., expected pCO_2 (mm Hg) = (1.5 × HCO_3^‑) + 8 ± 2, is used to identify the presence of a secondary acid-base disorder. In this patient expected 19.5–23.5, which means there is respiratory compensation (from hyperventilation) and no added respiratory acid-base disorder.\n\nIn patients with a hyperglycemic crisis, the measured sodium concentration should be used to calculate the anion gap.

This class of drugs inhibits the Na^+-Cl^- cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, resulting in decreased intracellular Na^+. This, in turn, enhances the activity of the Na^+-Ca^2+ exchanger, and increases the driving force for Ca^2+ resorption, which worsens hypercalcemia. Loop diuretics, not thiazide diuretics, may be considered in patients with hypercalcemia and renal insufficiency (as is the case here) to increase Ca^2+  secretion and prevent volume overload while receiving IV fluids.",

This class of drugs inhibits osteoclast activity, which decreases bone breakdown and calcium release. Dosage adjustment and close monitoring of renal function are recommended during bisphosphonate therapy in patients with renal impairment, as bisphosphonates are potentially nephrotoxic. In addition, calcitonin should be administered in patients with moderate or severe symptomatic hypercalcemia to increase urinary calcium excretion. Patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia are usually also dehydrated and require intravenous normal saline to lower blood calcium levels and achieve adequate urine output and blood pressure.\n\nMost patients with intact renal function and no other preexisting condition for high bone turnover (e.g., Paget disease of bone, malignancy) are able to compensate for increased bone resorption through increased urinary calcium excretion (i.e., hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia). However, this patient's renal insufficiency limits his ability to excrete calcium in the urine, resulting in hypercalcemia.",

Naloxone neutralizes the effects of opioids, restores respiration, and counteracts CNS depression. The drug should be administered slowly to prevent acute withdrawal syndrome. Because naloxone has a dose-dependent duration of action that is shorter than most opioids, repeat administration may be necessary. Following detoxification, naltrexone should be administered in order to prevent relapse of opioid dependence.",

He had a vertebrobasilar stroke 3 years ago and had been living in a nursing home since the stroke. In the emergency department, rapid sequence intubation was performed, the patient was mechanically ventilated, and empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated. Currently, his temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 85% with an FiO_2 of 0.6. On pulmonary examination, scattered crackles are heard bilaterally. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral opacities in all lung fields. This patient's current condition is most likely associated with which of the following pathophysiologic changes?",

        "explanation_why": "ARDS causes noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. In patients with pulmonary edema, the accumulation of fluid and protein in the lungs disrupts alveolar surfactant and increases the force needed to maintain open alveoli. An increase in the pressure required to inflate the lungs is the result of a decrease in lung compliance, which results in severe respiratory distress. In ARDS, the alveolar exudate causes the formation of hyaline membranes, which impair alveolar gas exchange and lead to hypoxemia. In addition, patients with ARDS commonly develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.",

He has no history of skin infections but has type 2 diabetes mellitus and has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Three days after admission, he becomes increasingly hypoxic and tachypneic. He is emergently intubated and ventilatory support is initiated. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m^2. His pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 95/60 mmHg. The ventilator is set at a tidal volume of 540 mL, respiratory rate of 20/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H_2O. On pulmonary examination, there are diffuse crackles. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Hemoglobin concentration is 11.5 g/dL, serum lactate is 4.0 mmol/L, and serum creatinine is 2.5 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas checked 30 minutes after intubation shows a PCO_2 of 50 mm Hg and a PO_2 of 55 mm Hg on an F_IO_2 of 1.0. An x-ray of the chest shows new bilateral infiltrates. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to improve tissue oxygen delivery in this patient?",

This presentation is concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially in the setting of his ongoing infection (wet gangrene). His P_aO_2/F_iO_2 ratio is less than 100, which categorizes his ARDS as severe and carries a high mortality risk.",

However, the high peak pressures and lung distention associated with high tidal volumes in patients with ARDS increase the risk of barotrauma and worsening respiratory distress. Using lower tidal volumes (lung protective ventilation of ∼ 6 mL/kg) improves mortality risk in patients with ARDS, and mild hypercapnia is tolerated in this regard (permissive hypercapnia).",

        "explanation_why": "ARDS is a syndrome with complex pathophysiology characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, leading to pulmonary edema, alveolar collapse, and impairment in gas exchange. Increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) will help distend the alveoli (thereby increasing alveolar ventilation as well as decreasing the work of breathing) and increase oxygen diffusion into the pulmonary capillaries. Patients with severe ARDS often require higher levels of PEEP to help recruit alveoli and improve gas exchange. Since this patient is already at maximum F_iO_2 and is on appropriate lung-protective ventilation settings (tidal volume of 6 mL/kg), increasing PEEP would be the most appropriate next step in management.",

Older patients with underlying heart disease (such as this 63-year-old man with coronary artery disease) are at increased risk of hemodynamic compromise. Signs of hemodynamic instability include hypotension, confusion, symptoms of heart failure (e.g., dyspnea), and chest pain. The goal of synchronized cardioversion is to terminate Afib and thereby restore hemodynamic stability as well as prevent further progression to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Synchronized cardioversion can also be considered for hemodynamically stable patients with acute onset of Afib (within the past 48 hours).",

Preexcitation is discernible on ECG as a shortened PR interval, while the subsequent myocardial conduction leads to a \"slurred\" upstroke in the QRS complex called a delta wave.

He has a history of gout, benign prostate hyperplasia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with allopurinol, tamsulosin, and metformin. Urinalysis shows pyuria, leukocyturia, and WBC casts. Results of blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient is diagnosed with pyelonephritis and admitted for empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 4 days, his symptoms have continued to worsen. He is somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. Temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. He is transferred to the intensive care unit and vasopressor therapy is initiated. The physician informs the patient's wife that her husband has developed urosepsis as a complication of his urinary tract infection and that advanced life support may become necessary. A written advance directive provided by the patient's primary care physician includes a do-not-intubate (DNI) order, which was verbally confirmed by the patient upon admission. There is no medical power of attorney. The patient's wife says she wants full life support in case of cardiorespiratory arrest. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

The patient's wishes should be honored even if family members disagree. This patient's living will includes a DNI order that he confirmed upon admission; therefore, he should not be intubated. Because this patient does not have a DNR order, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other resuscitative measures may be performed if needed. Patients who retain their decision-making capacity may revoke advance directives at any time. If a patient is incapacitated, only a durable medical power of attorney can override an advance directive, living will, DNI, or DNR.\n\nA patient's code status (e.g., the presence of a DNR or DNI) should be confirmed verbally with the patient or their appropriate surrogate and documented at each hospital admission.",

Once the patient is stabilized, the cause of the third-degree AV block should be investigated, followed by a long-term solution (e.g., permanent cardiac pacing) if no reversible cause is found.

    "question_text": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with severe menorrhagia for 3 days. She also reports dizziness. She has hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril. She appears pale. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

It generally occurs within 12 hours of transfusion and is characterized by hypertension, wide pulse pressure, and evidence of volume overload (pulmonary edema, S3 gallop, jugular venous distention). Risk increases with the number of units transfused and can be minimized by increasing time intervals between transfusions and limiting the rate of intravenous administration. Treatment usually involves the use of supplemental oxygen and mobilization of fluid with diuresis.\n\nSee “Differentiating between transfusion-related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated circulatory overload” table.",

Papillary muscle rupture is more common in patients with involvement of the right coronary, which supplies the posteromedial papillary muscle through the posterior descending artery without any collateral blood supply.

She speaks slowly with frequent breaks and has difficulty keeping her eyes open. Over the past three days, she has had a sore throat, runny nose, and low-grade fever. She says her eyes and tongue have been “heavy” for the past year. She goes to bed early because she feels too tired to talk or watch TV after dinner. She appears pale and anxious. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 26/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 118/65 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is bluish discoloration of her lips and around the mouth. Her nostrils dilate with every breath. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The exacerbation of myasthenic symptoms is commonly triggered by infections (evidenced in this patient by the history of a sore throat, runny nose, and fever), surgery, anesthesia, pregnancy, or certain medications.\n\nFollowing respiratory stabilization, further treatment consists of plasmapheresis (to remove acetylcholine receptor antibodies from the circulation) and intravenous immunoglobulin.

The liquid increases the density of the thoracic cavity where the pleural effusion is located, resulting in dullness to percussion, and decreases the transmission of breath sounds, resulting in decreased breath sounds on auscultation.\n\nIn this 62-year-old patient with a 38 pack-year smoking history as well as a history of increased fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and dry cough, a malignant pleural effusion due to a pulmonary malignancy should be suspected. He should undergo further evaluation with a CT scan of the chest and possibly thoracocentesis to assess for pulmonary malignancy.",

No gastric air bubble is seen projecting over the lower left hemithorax to suggest marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm from a large amount of atelectasis, but concave upper lateral borders, or menisci (white dashed lines), help confirm the presence of effusion extending to the mid thorax.The margins of the cardiac silhouette and left hemidiaphragm are obscured. Additionally, the cardiac silhouette is shifted slightly to the right (indicated by blue line and arrow) and the left bronchial tree is slightly elevated (indicated by black lines and arrow).In the right hemithorax, a small meniscus from effusion is seen laterally (indicated by red line). Additionally, increased opacification projects through the right hemidiaphragm indicating effusion in the posterior sulcus (red overlay).",

Central DI may be idiopathic or secondary; other secondary causes include traumatic brain injury, pituitary bleeding, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary ischemia, meningitis, and neurosurgery.\n\nDI is confirmed via the water deprivation test, which would show no change in urine osmolality despite a rising plasma osmolality. After DI is confirmed, desmopressin is administered to distinguish between central or nephrogenic DI. A subsequent increase in urine osmolality after a desmopressin trial indicates intact ADH receptors in the kidneys, confirming central diabetes insipidus.\n\nSee “Primary polydipsia vs. central DI vs. nephrogenic DI” table.",

This impairs the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine and results in the production of large amounts of dilute urine (up to 15 L/day).",

Additionally, weight loss, weakness, nausea/vomiting, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and hypotension would be expected.",

The episodes occur when he climbs stairs or tries to walk briskly on his treadmill. The symptoms resolve with rest. The previous evening he felt dizzy and weak during such an episode. He also reports that he had a cold 2 weeks ago. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 4 years ago but is otherwise healthy. His only medication is glyburide. He appears well. His pulse is 62/min and weak, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 134/90 mm Hg. Cardiovascular examination shows a late systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the second right intercostal space. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following mechanisms is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "In AS, blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta is obstructed by the narrowed aortic valve opening (increased afterload), which, over time, results in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH leads to increased left ventricular oxygen demand, resulting in myocardial ischemia (angina) during periods of strenuous exercise or stress. The inability to maintain cardiac output during exertion causes transient cerebral hypoperfusion and, therefore, presyncope or syncope.\n\nThe presence of symptoms in patients with AS is an indication for surgical repair, as symptomatic AS carries a poor prognosis.",

Common respiratory viruses (as this patient likely had) can cause epithelial damage to the airways, induce inflammation and bronchospasm, and subsequently trigger wheezing in both patients with and without underlying asthma.

The pain is localized to the periumbilical and hypogastric regions. A total of 20 mL of urine has drained from his urinary catheter since the end of the procedure. Temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Physical examination shows a 20-cm vertical midline incision and an ileostomy in the right lower quadrant. There is no fluid drainage from the surgical wounds. The urinary catheter flushes easily and is without obstruction. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show a blood urea nitrogen of 30 mg/dL and a creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "A urine output of < 0.5 mL/kg/hr for > 2 hours in a patient who has recently undergone surgery is consistent with postoperative oliguria. A BUN:creatinine ratio > 20:1 suggests a prerenal cause for the low urine output. This patient's abdominal pain is most likely due to surgery, and his vital signs are reassuring.",

The administration of intravenous crystalloid fluids (lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline) is the best next step in the management of a catheterized patient with postoperative oliguria and azotemia because increasing intravascular fluid volume via a fluid challenge will increase renal perfusion and thereby reverse these processes.\n\nIf the urine output does not increase after adequate fluid resuscitation, or if azotemia persists or worsens, a different cause of acute kidney injury (e.g., acute tubular necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, ongoing fluid losses, or, less likely, abdominal compartment syndrome) should be considered.",

However, the absence of tachycardia and/or hypotension makes intraabdominal hemorrhage very unlikely. An abdominal CT would also be indicated if a deep surgical site infection (e.g., bacterial peritonitis, intraabdominal abscess) or anastomotic leak were suspected.

This imaging technique typically shows an anechoic space between the pericardium and epicardium, indicating fluid accumulation. In a hemodynamically unstable patient like this one, an eFAST examination in the trauma bay is likely to reveal effusion; transthoracic echocardiography is used to evaluate the size and hemodynamic effect of the effusion and determine the best approach for draining the effusion. In patients with hemodynamic instability and evidence of cardiac tamponade on echocardiography, urgent pericardial fluid drainage (e.g., ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis) is indicated.",

The symptoms are worst when she is lying down. She also has swelling in her legs. She has squamous cell lung cancer, for which she has been receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide for the past month. She also has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are mildly decreased and heart sounds are muffled. Extremities are warm and there is pitting edema at both ankles. An x-ray of the chest shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette as well as opacities and cavitary lung lesions in the left middle lung zone. Serum studies show a slightly elevated troponin concentration, a creatinine concentration of 2.2 mg/dL, and urea nitrogen concentration of 45 mg/dL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia with low QRS voltage. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In this surgical procedure, part of the pericardium is removed to continuously drain excess fluid from the pericardial space into the pleural cavity, providing pericardial decompression.

    "question_text": "A 49-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis is brought to the emergency department by his wife because of 2 episodes of vomiting bright red blood over the past 2 hours. His wife reports that he drank 1 bottle of vodka over the past 24 hours. During this time, he has had nausea but no bloody or tarry stool, and no abdominal pain. There is no history of similar episodes. The patient takes no medications. On arrival, he is awake but confused. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 110/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows ascites. On mental status examination, he is not oriented to person, place, or time. During the examination, the patient has another episode of vomiting blood. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.5 g/dL. Two large intravenous catheters are placed, and administration of intravenous fluids is begun. When vital signs are measured again, his pulse is 94/min and blood pressure is 109/80 mm Hg. He does not respond to verbal commands but withdraws appropriately to painful stimuli. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) for NGT lavage was formerly used to help determine whether the bleeding originated from the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract and whether it was ongoing. However, NGT placement is no longer recommended in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding because it has limited diagnostic and therapeutic value, causes significant discomfort, and carries the risk of complications (e.g., aspiration and airway compromise). Furthermore, this patient's ongoing bright red hematemesis suggests ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so NGT placement would provide no additional information. Additionally, patients with suspected esophageal variceal bleeding should not undergo NGT placement, which may exacerbate bleeding and further damage the esophagus.",

A Mallory-Weiss tear is also an important differential diagnosis in this patient, as it is not known whether the hematemesis was preceded by emesis, retching, and coughing.",

PPIs should be administered intravenously to avoid further risking aspiration. The cause of this patient's hematemesis is still unclear, so empiric treatment with a PPI is an important part of initial management, although it is not the next best step for this patient.",

Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that preferentially agonizes alpha-1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction and an increase in systemic vascular resistance. Prolonged alpha receptor agonism can cause distal arterioles and their branches (especially cutaneous branches) to constrict to the point of causing distal ischemia and consequent necrosis. This phenomenon is most commonly observed in the fingertips and distal toes and manifests with symmetrical discoloration and coldness.",

The right and left coronary, the innominate, the left common carotid, and the subclavian arteries originate from the true lumen (green overlay; false lumen is red overlay). Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta. Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen.Additional findings include sternotomy wires, a prosthetic aortic valve, atherosclerotic calcifications, pancreatic calcifications, and a small hiatal hernia.LCA: left coronary artery; RCA: right coronary artery; yellow overlay: azygos vein",

        "explanation_why": "Conservative therapy with observation, blood pressure control, and analgesia is appropriate for most patients with uncomplicated descending aortic dissections (Stanford type B). Blood pressure control is essential in all patients with aortic dissection to prevent further progression of the dissection. Intravenous beta blockers (e.g., labetalol, esmolol) lower the heart rate and reduce the left ventricular ejection fraction, thereby reducing shearing forces within the aorta. If IV beta blocker therapy does not lower systolic blood pressure to 90–120 mm Hg, patients should also receive vasodilators (e.g., sodium nitroprusside). To avoid reflex tachycardia, beta-blocker therapy should be started before vasodilators.\n\nPatients with uncomplicated type B dissections do not require surgical intervention unless they develop complications (e.g., aortic rupture, renal failure, abdominal pain due to intestinal ischemia). Patients treated conservatively who develop worsening pain or features suggestive of complications should have vascular imaging repeated immediately.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Sudden and severe tearing pain, asymmetrical blood pressure readings, and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray are consistent with aortic dissection. Uncontrolled hypertension and chronic smoking are independent risk factors for aortic dissection. The moderate pulmonary hyperinflation in this patient is not the result of aortic dissection but caused by the concomitant COPD.",

        "explanation_why": "Tactile crepitus over the neck is a sign of subcutaneous emphysema. Spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema can occur following spontaneous esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome), which can manifest with acute-onset chest pain and mediastinal widening (due to a pneumomediastinum). However, Boerhaave syndrome is usually preceded by a history of vomiting and/or severe retching, and features such as asymmetrical blood pressure readings are not be expected.",

        "explanation_why": "Muffled heart sounds are a sign of cardiac tamponade, a possible complication of ascending aortic dissection (Stanford type A) due to progression of the dissection beyond the aortic root. If the dissection results in a tear of the tunica externa, aortic blood can leak into the pericardium. Pericardial fluid will decrease the transmission of heart sounds to the precordium.\n\nOther possible complications of ascending aortic dissections include myocardial infarction (due to coronary artery occlusion), aortic regurgitation (extension of the dissection into the aortic valve), and stroke (extension of the dissection into the carotids).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "For initial treatment of ARDS, a high FiO_2 (e.g., 0.9) and PEEP (e.g., 14 cm H_2O) are often chosen to ensure adequate oxygenation. However, while the target pO_2 in ARDS is 55–80 mm Hg, this patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pO₂ of 140 mm Hg, suggesting excessive oxygenation. Sustained oxygen supplementation with a FiO_2 > 0.6 increases the risk of developing oxygen toxicity, which is associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients. Hyperoxemia increases this patient's risk of developing absorption atelectasis and ventilator-associated pneumonia and may exacerbate his lung damage (e.g., pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, fibrosis) and hypercapnia (oxygen-induced hypercapnia). The current PEEP ≥ 5 cm H_2O is adequate to allow for alveolar recruitment; the FiO_2, in contrast, should be reduced to the lowest possible fraction that provides sufficient oxygenation.\n\nPatients without signs, symptoms, or imaging findings of respiratory disease immediately after successful rescue from drowning may develop a submersion injury within hours of the rescue. Aspirated water compromises the function of surfactant, which can ultimately lead to ARDS.",

    "hint": "Altered mental status, jaundice, and asterixis (jerking movement of the outstretched hands on wrist extension) in a patient with a history of chronic hepatitis C and signs of chronic liver disease (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, gynecomastia), are concerning for hepatic encephalopathy (HE).",

        "explanation_why": "Treatment of acute HE begins with correcting the precipitating factors (e.g., hypovolemia, GI bleeding, electrolyte disturbances). In this patient, the use of hydrochlorothiazide with subsequent volume depletion, hypokalemia, and contraction alkalosis are the likely precipitating factors. Prompt intravenous fluid resuscitation and administration of potassium is the most appropriate next step in the management in this patient. In addition, diuretics should be discontinued if possible. Finally, patients with HE should also receive treatment with lactulose to lower the serum ammonia concentration.\n\nHypokalemia, which can be precipitated by the use of diuretics, is accompanied by the intracellular movement of hydrogen ions into cells to maintain electrical neutrality. The resulting intracellular acidosis in renal tubular cells can lead to increased production of ammonia and bicarbonate from glutamine to maintain acid-base balance. Metabolic alkalosis, which can also be precipitated by the use of diuretics, leads to increased conversion of ammonium to ammonia. Ammonia is then able to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in increased neurotoxin accumulation in the brain.",

However, this patient has a normal BUN and mild hypokalemia, with no urgent indication for hemodialysis. Although hypokalemia can cause delirium, mild hypokalemia is unlikely to cause severe altered mental status. Furthermore, this patient's jaundice, asterixis, and altered mental state are more consistent with HE, rather than uremia or severe electrolyte derangement.

        "explanation_why": "Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure (TIPS) is performed in patients with portal hypertension with refractory complications (i.e., esophageal variceal bleeding). TIPS worsens the risk of HE by shunting portal blood (which contains high levels of ammonia and other neurotoxins), to the systemic circulation. As the liver is bypassed with TIPS, these neurotoxins are not metabolized. Therefore, TIPS should not be pursued in this patient.",

            "description": "Portal hypertension (i.e., elevated portal venous pressure), can lead to the backflow of venous blood into portosystemic anastomoses (gastrointestinal varices) through the branches of the portal vein. Increased blood flow in esophageal varices can cause potentially life-threatening variceal hemorrhages.In TIPS, a metallic stent is inserted through the jugular vein to connect a hepatic vein radicle with an intrahepatic branch of the portal vein. TIPS diverts the drainage of blood from the portal to the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver, thus lowering portal pressure and reducing the risk of variceal bleeding. TIPS increases the level of ammonia in the systemic circulation because blood bypasses the liver, increasing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.",

He has sharp right-sided chest pain that worsens on inspiration and coughing. Two weeks ago, the patient was admitted to the hospital after passing out on the street from alcohol intoxication but he left against medical advice. He has coronary artery disease and hypertension. He takes no medications. He drinks 4 cans of beer daily and has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg. Examination shows poor dentition. There is dullness to percussion at the base of the right lung. Crackles and markedly decreased breath sounds are heard over the right middle and lower lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows a right-sided loculated pleural effusion and consolidation of the surrounding lung with visible air bronchogram; there are no rib fractures. Thoracocentesis is performed. Examination of this patient's pleural fluid is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

        "explanation_why": "Postoperative atelectasis is one of the most common pulmonary complications in the first 72 hours after surgery. After chest or abdominal surgery, inadequately controlled postoperative pain discourages deep breathing (which is important for alveolar recruitment at the lung bases) and impairs coughing (which can lead to mucus plugging in an airway and absorption atelectasis). Patients subsequently develop regional alveolar collapse and hypoxemia from a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch as well as a right-to-left pulmonary shunt in the area of atelectasis.\n\nTo compensate for the resulting hypoxemia, the patient hyperventilates to increase ventilation of the noncollapsed alveoli and often develops respiratory alkalosis (high pH, low pCO_2). Hypoxemia due to a right-to-left pulmonary shunt cannot be improved by 100% O_2 delivery; instead, alveolar recruitment needs to be facilitated using adequate analgesia and lung expansion maneuvers.",

The pain started suddenly after he got out of bed in the morning and is worse on inspiration. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic nephropathy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 37 years. Current medications include metformin and sitagliptin. Temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. The left lower extremity is swollen and erythematous. Auscultation of the lungs discloses mild bibasilar crackles. Arterial blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia and decreased PCO_2. Urinalysis shows 4+ protein. ECG shows a new right bundle branch block; there are no ST abnormalities. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

    "hint": "This patient's presentation with sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxemia, hypocapnia, signs of right heart strain (right bundle branch block on ECG), and features of deep venous thrombosis (asymmetric lower extremity swelling) is concerning for pulmonary embolism (PE). Nephrotic-range proteinuria occurs in severe cases of diabetic nephropathy and increases the risk of thromboembolic events.",

        "explanation_why": "Decreased left ventricular contractility can be seen following a myocardial infarction, which can manifest with sudden chest pain, dyspnea, and bibasilar crackles on auscultation. However, an ECG would show other findings (e.g., ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversion). This patient's findings are more suggestive of PE, which does not affect left ventricular contractility. Although cardiac output might be decreased in patients with PE, this is usually secondary to decreased right ventricular output caused by the embolic obstruction.",

A decreased PaO_2/FiO_2 ratio is also used as a diagnostic criterion for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); it is associated with increased mortality in both ARDS and PE.",

This patient's new-onset dyspnea, smoking history, and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation could indicate an acute COPD exacerbation. However, patients with COPD have an increased rather than decreased PCO_2. Moreover, other features of COPD, such as cough and wheezing on pulmonary examination, are not seen here.",

Patients with PE have an increased A-a gradient due to mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary artery, which results in segments of the lung being ventilated but not perfused (i.e., ventilation-perfusion mismatch). In these segments, oxygen is not effectively transferred from the alveoli to the arteries, causing the alveolar oxygen concentration to be higher than the arterial oxygen concentration (i.e., increased A-a gradient).\n\nHypoxemia with an increased A-a gradient is also seen in patients with impaired pulmonary diffusion capacity (e.g., due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) or right-to-left cardiac shunt.",

Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender and the uterus is soft. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 g/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration.

        "explanation_why": "Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare, life-threatening complication of childbirth in which amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation. AFE typically manifests during or shortly after labor or vaginal/cesarean delivery with abrupt onset of severe respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological compromise. Most patients progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation, which manifests with severe bleeding (e.g., from intravenous lines) and multiorgan dysfunction. AFE is mainly a clinical diagnosis. Treatment is supportive and involves respiratory and hemodynamic support, including the transfusion of blood products, to ensure adequate oxygenation and perfusion for both the mother and fetus. Up to 50% of patients with AFE die within an hour of onset.\n\nThe exact pathophysiology of AFE is not fully understood but likely involves an immune response (e.g., mast cell degranulation, complement system activation to fetal antigens that enter the maternal circulation). Risk factors for AFE include multiparity, age > 35 years, and complicated labor (e.g., placenta previa/abruption, forceps delivery, eclampsia).",

Afterwards, the patient reports shortness of breath and chest pain with deep inspiration. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit prior to admission to the hospital. He does not drink alcohol. He is in distress and appears ill. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 135/min and weak, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Physical examination shows jugular venous distention. Cardiac examination shows a regular, rapid heart rate and a holosystolic murmur that increases during inspiration. His abdomen is soft and mildly tender to palpation around the surgical site. Examination of his extremities shows pitting edema of the left leg. His skin is cold and clammy. Further examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

A massive pulmonary embolism (PE) causes elevation of pulmonary artery pressures, leading to right ventricular pressure overload and dilation (right heart strain). Right ventricular dysfunction ultimately leads to decreased left atrial filling and left ventricular cardiac output, and eventually to obstructive shock. This patient shows evidence of hemodynamic instability from PE, so a dilated right ventricular cavity and tricuspid regurgitation would be expected findings on echocardiography.\n\nFurther findings on echocardiography in patients with massive PE include dilation of the inferior vena cava and decreased contractility of the right ventricular free wall with normal apical movement (McConnell sign).",

Conditions that result in biliary stasis and/or hypoperfusion of the gallbladder such as trauma, surgery, total parenteral nutrition, multiple transfusions, which are also seen here, are risk factors for acalculous cholecystitis. The presence of RUQ tenderness and laboratory evidence of biliary stasis (i.e., elevated bilirubin, and ALP) further support the clinical diagnosis of AC.",

Inflammation also involves the adjacent duodenum (blue hatched overlay) and hepatic flexure. The liver shows heterogeneous enhancement with reactive hyperemia (examples indicated by red overlay) adjacent to the gallbladder. The gallbladder is not dilated, and no calculi are seen. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.Additional CT findings include free peritoneal fluid (blue overlay), colonic diverticula (examples indicated by green arrowheads), small hypodense liver lesions, fat-containing umbilical (green arrow) and left inguinal (white arrow) hernias, and bilateral atelectasis or scarring (examples indicated by red overlay) in the lower lungs.",

        "explanation_why": "Emergency revascularization is the most important step in the management of patients with acute STEMI because it restores the patency of the occluded coronary artery, limiting a further increase in the size of the infarction. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA) is the preferred method of revascularization. Since early reperfusion is associated with improved clinical outcomes, door-to-balloon time should be < 90 minutes. Fibrinolytic therapy may be considered if PCTA fails or cannot be performed within 120 minutes of the patient arriving at the hospital.\n\nOral dual antiplatelet therapy (P2Y12 receptor inhibitor and aspirin) and intravenous anticoagulation therapy (heparin or bivalirudin) are also indicated for patients with STEMI and may be initiated during or prior to transportation to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, but definitive treatment should not be delayed. Beta-blocker therapy is associated with improved outcomes for patients and must be initiated within the first 24 hours of admission unless there are contraindications. Patients should also be started on high-intensity statin therapy regardless of baseline cholesterol levels.",

Patients typically present with signs of a unilateral maxillofacial infection such as retro-orbital headache, facial pain, nasal discharge, and fever. Severe cases can also lead to altered levels of consciousness (indicative of cerebral involvement), eschars (due to microvascular occlusion and resulting tissue necrosis), and cranial nerve palsies. The presence of eschar is particularly concerning for this condition. This patient has several of these early and late signs and symptoms. Moreover, diabetic ketoacidosis is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of this infection. The history of missed insulin doses combined with urine and serum ketones is diagnostic of ketoacidosis.",

The most common sites of K. pneumoniae infection are the urinary tract (cystitis and pyelonephritis) and the lower respiratory tract (pneumonia). This patient is certainly at risk of developing an infection with this agent but the current presentation of necrotizing maxillofacial infection would be very unusual for K. pneumoniae.",

The most common presentations are isolated skin abscesses in an adult or impetigo in a child. A necrotizing infection of the face would be very uncommon for this pathogen. Moreover, the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis and a newly formed eschar is more concerning for infection from a different organism.",

It is implicated in many infectious conditions and can be especially difficult to treat in cases of nosocomial or multidrug-resistant infections. With regard to the subpopulation of diabetic patients, Pseudomonas classically causes malignant otitis externa. This condition leads to severe ear pain, discharge from the ear canal, facial nerve palsy, and local extension to periauricular structures. Examination may show granulation tissue (often described as “sand-like”). Besides poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, other risk factors include advancing age and general immunosuppression.

Radiation to the area between the scapulae is also very common. Aortic dissection is associated with asymmetrical blood pressure in the upper extremities and can progress to cardiac tamponade (ascending dissection), which leads to hypotension and cardiogenic shock. This patient has none of these symptoms. Furthermore, the presence of ST elevations on ECG would be a rare finding with aortic dissection, making a different cause much more likely. In rare cases in which aortic dissection propagates all the way to the aortic root and the coronary ostia are occluded by the false lumen of the dissection, ST elevations may be present.

        "explanation_why": "Early initiation of a high-intensity statin (e.g., atorvastatin) regardless of baseline cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels, is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI). Statins stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, lower lipid levels, and play an important role in both acute and long-term management. Initiation of oral atorvastatin during hospitalization is a critical step in comprehensive STEMI management and secondary prevention. In addition, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker should be started early to reduce mortality and prevent adverse remodeling.\n\nPatients with STEMI should undergo emergency coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The ideal door-to-PCI time is less than 90 minutes, and the procedure should start no later than 120 minutes after first medical contact. If PCI cannot be initiated within this time frame or if the procedure is unsuccessful, thrombolytic therapy is indicated.",

        "explanation_why": "This set of findings is consistent with metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap, e.g., due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In DKA, the accumulation of acidic ketone bodies leads to a marked decrease in pH. Serum bicarbonate (HCO_3^-) is low because it is consumed as a buffer. Despite actual total body potassium deficits, most patients with DKA present with normal potassium levels due to the shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space. Evacuation of gastric contents, however, removes acid from the body, which in turn leads to metabolic alkalosis.",

        "explanation_why": "This set of findings is consistent with metabolic alkalosis caused by a loss of gastric acid (e.g., due to nasogastric suction or vomiting). Since gastric acid mainly consists of hydrogen chloride (HCl), hypochloremia is expected. Although small quantities of potassium chloride (KCl) are also lost with the gastric fluid, volume depletion, which leads to secondary hyperaldosteronism and, consequently, stimulation of renal potassium excretion is the main cause of hypokalemia associated with continuous nasogastric decompression. Moreover, renal loss of hydrogen ions leads to an increased formation of bicarbonate (HCO_3^-). See “Acid-base disturbances associated with GI disorders” table.",

        "explanation_why": "This set of findings is consistent with partially compensated respiratory alkalosis, as may be seen in hyperventilation. Hyperventilation leads to an increase in pH due to a CO_2 washout (i.e., hypocapnia). As a compensatory response, renal bicarbonate (HCO_3^-) reabsorption is reduced, leading to decreased serum levels. Respiratory alkalosis is usually associated with hypokalemia due to a potassium shift from the extracellular space into cells. Although continuous nasogastric decompression also leads to an increase in pH, the loss of gastric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and, thus, an increase in bicarbonate.",

Increasing the preload optimizes left ventricular filling and reduces hemodynamic instability.\n\nIf blood pressure cannot be maintained with a fluid bolus, vasopressors and/or an intra-aortic balloon pump can be used.",

He has not had fever, nausea, headache, or diarrhea. His mother reports an episode of severe pain and swelling of his hands and feet when he was 12 months old, which self-resolved after 2 weeks. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. Examination shows marked weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. An MRI scan of the brain shows signs of an evolving cerebral infarction on the patient's left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "In a young patient, ischemic stroke, a history of dactylitis (pain/swelling of the hands and feet), and low O_2 saturation suggest sickle cell disease (SCD). Sickled red blood cells are rigid and tend to clump along the walls of arteries, which can lead to thrombosis, infarction, and end-organ ischemia (cerebral infarction in this case).",

        "explanation_why": "Immediate exchange transfusion is the first-line therapy in SCD patients with an acute ischemic stroke. During exchange transfusion, erythrocytes with HbS are removed and exchanged with HbS-free erythrocytes, reducing both the concentration of HbS and the rate of vasoocclusion, as well as increasing oxygen delivery. Although exchange transfusion improves outcomes, it does not reverse pre-existing vasoocclusion. In this patient, supplemental oxygen should also be administered to maintain a saturation above 95%.\n\nPrevention of stroke in children with SCD includes screening with transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Identified high-risk patients, as well as children who have already had an ischemic stroke, should receive chronic blood transfusions to lower the proportion of HbS.",

Most ischemic strokes are caused by thrombi, but this patient's symptoms are most likely due to the clumping of sickled red blood cells, for which tPA therapy is not effective. In addition, this patient is only 5 years of age, and tPA is not FDA-approved for the treatment of stroke in individuals < 18 years. A different therapy that has a rapid effect and allows for the control of HbS levels is more appropriate.",

As it functions primarily by raising fetal hemoglobin levels, which can take several months to increase significantly, hydroxyurea would not be helpful in the management of an acute ischemic stroke.

The proximal convoluted tubules reabsorb HCO_3^-, improving the buffer capacity of the serum against lower pH. The distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys also increase excretion of H^+ (in the form of H_2PO_4^‑ and NH_4^+), raising the blood pH to compensate for respiratory acidosis.",

This patient's metabolic acidosis is most likely caused by diarrhea, which commonly leads to loss of bicarbonate, although metformin and dapagliflozin can also cause lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, respectively. In patients with metabolic acidosis, the expected pCO_2 concentration is calculated according to the Winter formula to check if the patient has developed the expected respiratory compensation. Patients with a pCO_2 higher than expected, as seen here, have concomitant respiratory acidosis. The failed respiratory compensation and consequent mixed acid-base disorder in this patient with morbid obesity are most likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome.",

It is not a common finding in acute anterior MI. A more common auscultatory finding in a patient with acute MI would be the holosystolic (not diastolic) murmur associated with mitral regurgitation. This valvular dysfunction is due to papillary muscle rupture and is more commonly seen in a right coronary artery occlusion causing infarction of the posteromedial papillary muscle.",

It is frequently heard in the acute phase of an MI because of impaired relaxation of the ischemic left ventricle. An S_4  may also be heard in conditions that cause ventricular hypertrophy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, or hypertension. Older patients can have an S_4 as a normal finding because ventricular compliance decreases with age.\n\nA ventricular gallop (S_3), on the other hand, is caused by a sudden deceleration of blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle during early diastole. This finding can be normal in young adults (< 40 years) or pregnant women, but it is abnormal in older adults. An S_3 may be heard in dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or valvular diseases such as chronic mitral or aortic regurgitation. It is not a common finding in acute MI.",

Blood shifts from the left atrium to the right atrium, which increases right ventricular preload across all phases of the respiratory cycle.

As a compensatory mechanism, the myocardium undergoes concentric hypertrophy to maintain cardiac output. Over time, the compensatory response of LV thickening is associated with the maladaptive change of interstitial myocardial fibrosis, which leads to an increase in LV stiffness and impaired myocardial relaxation. As a result, patients develop an increase in left ventricular filling pressures and reduced ventricular filling with normal ventricular contraction (i.e., diastolic dysfunction). Severe myocardial fibrosis can ultimately impair myocardial contractility and result in systolic dysfunction but in such a scenario, the patient will have a low ejection fraction.\n\nNote that impaired myocardial relaxation could have also been correct for restrictive cardiomyopathy, in which the ventricular walls harden without myocardial hypertrophy.",

        "explanation_why": "Opiates such as morphine can reduce patient anxiety and the work of breathing by decreasing central sympathetic output. They also cause peripheral vasodilation and venodilation, decreasing ventricular filling pressure. However, there is not enough available evidence regarding the benefits or potential risks associated with morphine administration (e.g., hypopnea, nausea) in patients with congestive heart failure. Therefore, morphine is not considered standard treatment in the management of acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure and would not be the most appropriate initial step in this patient who does not report significant anxiety.",

Loop diuretics are a first-line treatment for symptomatic relief in acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure in patients with normal or elevated blood pressure. To assess the response to therapy and prevent excessive diuresis and preload reduction, it is important to monitor for adverse effects such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia as well as weight changes and volume status. Intravenous vasodilators (e.g., nitroglycerine, nitroprusside) can be considered as an adjunct treatment. These agents cause peripheral vasodilation, resulting in pooling of blood in the venous system, which rapidly reduces ventricular filling pressures and improves cardiac function.",

This blockage results in blood “backing up” into the right atrium, resulting in increased CVP. Low cardiac output results in hypotension, which induces peripheral vascular constriction and thus increases SVR. However, PCWP is decreased in obstructive shock caused by PE because insufficient blood is delivered to the left atrium (LA), causing a decrease in LA pressure.\n\nIn certain cases of obstructive shock (e.g., due to cardiac tamponade), PCWP can also be increased.",

Myocardial infarction causes an acute reduction in cardiac function that usually affects the left ventricle (95% of patients). Loss of left ventricular function leads to an increase in left atrial pressure, which is measured as an increase in PCWP. Progressive loss of cardiac function further impedes venous return to the heart, leading to a high CVP. In addition, there is a decrease in cardiac output and cardiac index, which is countered by systemic vasoconstriction in an attempt to maintain central perfusion. This vasoconstriction leads to an increased SVR and cool extremities with delayed capillary refill.\n\nSee “Hemodynamic parameters in shock” table.",

She has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she takes verapamil. Following stent placement, the patient was started on aspirin and clopidogrel. She appears to be in acute distress and is disoriented. Respirations are 22/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 80%. Diffuse crackles are heard on auscultation of the chest. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is started. Shortly afterwards, she becomes unresponsive. Heart sounds are inaudible and her carotid pulses are not palpable. The cardiac monitor shows normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Indications include respiratory acidosis, as seen here, severe dyspnea with signs of increased work of breathing and/or respiratory muscle fatigue, and persistent hypoxemia despite supplemental oxygen. As the name implies, noninvasive ventilation provides positive pressure ventilation through a noninvasive interface (e.g., facemask). Compared to endotracheal intubation, NIPPV carries a lower risk of complications (e.g., barotrauma, airway trauma) and is associated with decreased hospital length-of-stay, lower mortality, and a decreased risk of complications such as infections.\n\nInvasive mechanical ventilation is indicated only if a trial of NIPPV fails (e.g., poor patient tolerance, worsening hypoxemia), if NIPPV is contraindicated (e.g., altered mental status, high risk of aspiration), or if the patient has severe hemodynamic instability.",

This damage results in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, a V/Q mismatch, intrapulmonary shunting, increased pulmonary artery pressure (due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction), and increased work of breathing (due to decreased lung compliance), and ultimately leads to respiratory distress with type 1 respiratory failure. The left atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remain unaffected in ARDS.\n\nSepsis is the most common cause of ARDS and is likely present in this patient as evidenced by the fever, tachycardia, hypotension, warm extremities, and leukocytosis.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "All patients with suspected acute cyanide poisoning should receive antidotal treatment in addition to supportive measures (e.g., 100% oxygen therapy) and body surface decontamination. Cyanide poisoning is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and antidotal treatment should not be delayed for further diagnostic testing. Intravenous hydroxocobalamin is the first-line antidote because it acts rapidly, does not affect tissue oxygenation, and has minimal adverse effects. Hydroxocobalamin binds cyanide directly, forming cobalamin, which is then excreted in urine. This drug can be coadministered with sodium thiosulfate to enhance cyanide elimination.\n\nAlternative treatment for patients with cyanide poisoning includes nitrites (e.g., amyl or sodium nitrite), which induce methemoglobinemia. Cyanide preferentially binds to methemoglobin, forming the compound cyanomethemoglobin and freeing cytochrome complex IV to resume oxidative phosphorylation. Because of the risk of worsening tissue hypoxia, this therapy should not be used in patients with inhalation injury unless concomitant carbon monoxide toxicity has been excluded.",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "A combination of antimuscarinic effects (e.g., sedation, dry flushed skin, hyperthermia, pupillary dilation, decreased bowel sounds, sinus tachycardia) with α_1 receptor blockade (hypotension) is suggestive of intoxication with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which are used in the treatment of major depressive disorder and for migraine prophylaxis.

Serotonin syndrome manifests with tachycardia, hyperthermia, and altered mental status, as seen here. Given that this patient has major depressive disorder and migraine, she may have been prescribed one or more of the aforementioned drugs.

        "explanation_why": "TCAs directly inhibit fast sodium channels and cause an intraventricular conduction delay, which manifests as wide QRS complexes. Wide QRS complexes correlate positively with the risk of seizures and ventricular tachyarrhythmias from TCA toxicity. A QRS complex > 100 ms in duration is, therefore, an indication for initiating sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO_3) therapy in patients with TCA overdose. NaHCO_3 therapy, which increases extracellular Na^+ concentration, leads to an increased Na^+ concentration gradient across the cellular membrane and thereby attenuates the Na^+ channel blockade. In patients with CNS depression, avoidance of respiratory acidosis is important because acidemia increases the release of lipid- and protein-bound TCA as well as the binding of TCA to Na^+ channels. NaHCO_3 therapy as well as early intubation and mechanical ventilation is helpful in this regard.",

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous administration of 0.9% saline, an isotonic fluid, is the best initial step in the management of this patient with severe hypovolemia and hypernatremia. Although normal saline only increases extracellular fluid volume and has a minimal effect on lowering the serum sodium concentration, it should be administered first in a patient with hypovolemic shock to prevent severe complications of volume depletion, such as myocardial and/or cerebral ischemia. After adequate expansion of the extracellular fluid volume, the next step in management is to correct the hypernatremia with a gradual infusion of 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline. Hypotonic saline is preferred in patients with subacute or chronic mild hypovolemic hypernatremia because it corrects the free water deficit without rapidly decreasing the serum osmolality, which can cause cerebral edema.",

The pain is dull and diffuse over her abdomen and radiates to her lower back bilaterally. Three weeks ago, she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and started on warfarin. Her only other medication is 1 g of acetaminophen three times daily for osteoarthritis of her knees. Her pulse is 87/min and blood pressure is 112/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness to palpation at both lower quadrants. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a retroperitoneal mass and hazy margins of the surrounding structures.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "This patient presents with dull abdominal pain radiating to her lower back, which, in combination with the abdominal CT findings, suggests retroperitoneal hemorrhage. High-dose acetaminophen can interact with warfarin, resulting in increased warfarin activity, which affects the extrinsic coagulation system.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's history of taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation and high-dose acetaminophen for osteoarthritis likely contributed to the retroperitoneal hematoma. Acetaminophen metabolites inhibit vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and thereby the formation of coagulation factors in the extrinsic pathway. This patient should receive intravenous prothrombin complex concentrate to replenish the vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X) and intravenous phytonadione, a vitamin K produced by plants, to aid in factor activation.\n\nSee “Overview of anticoagulant reversal” table.",

Platelet dysfunction usually manifests with mucosal bleeding (e.g., bleeding gums, epistaxis, petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis).

Because of its side effect profile, which includes volume overload and transfusion reactions, a different reversal agent is preferred. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent mainly used for treating severe blood loss due to severe trauma, surgery, and post-partum hemorrhage, but it is not classically used for warfarin reversal.",

It is indicated for excessive bleeding in patients on thrombolytics (e.g., streptokinase, tPA), but it would not be used to counteract the effects of warfarin in the case of hemorrhage. Packed red blood cells (pRBC) are classically indicated in severe blood loss due to acute hemorrhage (with or without hypovolemic shock) or symptomatic anemia (e.g., G6PD deficiency). However, in a patient without signs of hypoxia (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, dyspnea) or anemia (e.g., exertional dyspnea. fatigue, pallor), pRBC should not be administered.

Dimercaprol chelates several heavy metals, including arsenic, to form more stable, nontoxic, soluble compounds that are then excreted in the urine.\n\nIn cases of recent arsenic ingestion (within an hour), additional therapies include gastric lavage and activated charcoal (to absorb arsenic in the gastrointestinal tract).

        "explanation_why": "This profile suggests septic shock, most likely due to a urinary tract infection, which is the most common type of distributive shock. Septic shock involves an excessive inflammatory response to a disseminated infection, triggering the release of circulating cytokines and bacterial toxins. Consequently, these mediators induce pathological vasodilatation, resulting in decreased systemic vascular resistance (afterload), as well as decreased central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). The drop in afterload, together with a compensatory increase in heart rate, leads to elevated cardiac output (CO). Although CO may decrease in the decompensation stage due to myocardial ischemia, this is unlikely in a patient with new onset of symptoms. Patients with septic shock often present with warm, flushed skin as a result of this pathophysiology (see “Typical hemodynamic parameters of types of shock” table).\n\nThe most important initial steps in the management of septic shock are aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids and the early administration of empiric antibiotic therapy. Vasopressors should be added if there is no improvement with intravenous fluid management.",

In response to the decrease in cardiac output, there is increase in SVR. Poor forward flow leads to increases in PCWP and CVP. In cardiogenic shock, patients will have cold, clammy skin on exam.

However, aortic stenosis produces a mid-to-late systolic murmur instead of the early murmur in this patient and it does not explain this patient's loud S_1.

        "explanation_why": "Dyspnea, tachycardia, and evidence of hyperdynamic circulation (e.g., loud S_1/S_2, systolic ejection murmur due to increased blood flow) are features of severe anemia. In patients with anemia, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P_aO_2), which reflects dissolved oxygen content, and the arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (S_aO_2) remain normal. However, the total arterial oxygen content (C_aO_2), which is given by the formula [1.34 x S_aO_2 x hemoglobin concentration] + [0.003 x P_aO_2]), would be decreased because the total hemoglobin concentration is decreased. Therefore, the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues (DO_2) is decreased and tissues extract more oxygen per gram of hemoglobin in order to meet the metabolic demands (VO_2). This results in a decreased hemoglobin oxygen saturation in venous blood, which is measured by S_vO_2.",
        "explanation_but": "Other causes of decreased S_vO_2 include decreased DO_2 due to hypoxemia caused by a lung disease, increased tissue O_2 extraction due to decreased cardiac output (e.g., heart failure, hypovolemic shock), increased VO_2 (e.g., exercise, high fever, seizures), and an inability of hemoglobin to bind to O_2 (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning). If S_vO_2 is decreased as a result of decreased cardiac output or increased VO_2, S_aO_2 would usually be normal. However, pulse oximetry may erroneously show a decreased oxygen saturation in the case of decreased cardiac output because of poor peripheral circulation. If S_vO_2 is decreased as a result of lung disease or carbon monoxide poisoning, S_aO_2 would also be decreased. However, pulse oximetry may erroneously show a normal oxygen saturation in the case of carbon monoxide poisoning because carboxyhemoglobin has a cherry red color.

    "hint": "This patient presents with acute encephalopathy, signs of tetany (muscle spasms), and hyperventilation. His laboratory studies are notable for an elevated anion gap AG = 137 - (99 + 8) = 30 and an elevated osmolar gap (32 mOsmol/kg H_2O). The presence of oxalate crystals in the urine indicates that he ingested a substance that is metabolized to oxalate.",

Although methanol poisoning would explain many of this man's symptoms (anion gap, altered mental status, increased serum osmolar gap), the key distinguishing feature in this patient is the formation of urine oxalate crystals, which is not seen with methanol toxicity.",

        "explanation_why": "Ethylene glycol is enzymatically oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase, then aldehyde dehydrogenase, to form oxalate, glyoxylate, and glycolate. These metabolites collect in the renal system and are detectable in the urine as oxalate crystals, which can cause flank pain, hematuria, oliguria, and acute kidney injury. Hypocalcemia, the cause of this patient's tetany, is a result of calcium being consumed by oxalate to form calcium oxalate. Other signs of ethylene glycol poisoning include altered mental status and tachypnea (due to respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis). Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning consists of fomepizole to competitively inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase, as ethylene glycol itself is not nearly as toxic as its metabolites.",

Although this patient's altered mental status and vomiting may also be seen in organophosphate poisoning, oxalate crystals would not be seen. Additionally, he lacks the other classic symptoms of cholinergic toxicity (e.g., miosis, bradycardia, and diaphoresis), which makes this an unlikely cause of his symptoms.",

Patients present with dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia. However, this syndrome would manifest 2–10 weeks after an MI rather than 72 hours as seen in this patient. Furthermore, fever is usually present, cardiac auscultation would reveal a pericardial friction rub, and ECG would show ST elevations in all leads.",

This patient's localization of Q waves in the anteroseptal leads (e.g., V1–V4) suggests an infarction of the left anterior descending artery, which supplies the anterolateral papillary muscle. Acute mitral regurgitation can lead to signs of heart failure, as seen in this patient. The posteromedial papillary muscle is supplied only by the posterior descending artery and is at especially high risk of ischemia due to lack of collateral supply.",

The patient here is unstable with hypotension and tachycardia, so the pneumothorax should be decompressed as quickly as possible. Since the neurovascular bundle runs below each rib, the upper edge of the rib is the preferred puncture site to help mitigate the risk of excessive bleeding and nerve damage. Emergency needle thoracostomy should be followed by chest tube placement in the 5^th intercostal space along the midaxillary line.\n\nAccording to the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, the 2^nd left intercostal space along the midclavicular line is no longer the preferred needle insertion site for emergency decompression of a tension pneumothorax in adults. This location is associated with high failure rates because of increased anterior chest wall thickness. Instead, placing the needle in the 5^th left intercostal space along the midaxillary line is preferable.",

Cirrhosis is caused by chronic damage to the liver parenchyma and manifests with impaired liver function, which can cause decreased production of coagulation factors. As a result, patients can develop a bleeding diathesis (e.g., blood oozing around IV sites, prolonged PT and PTT). However, cirrhosis typically also causes other manifestations, such as jaundice, asterixis, spider angiomata, and ascites.

        "explanation_why": "These serum findings are most consistent with DIC as evidenced by increased prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and D-dimer. DIC is a disorder characterized by systemic activation of the clotting cascade with microthrombi formation, which results in the exhaustion of all clotting factors. Microthrombi precipitate microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which results in schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. The depletion of clotting factors prolongs the PT and PTT. Fibrinogen is activated in the clotting cascade to become fibrin; thus, a decrease in fibrinogen is expected in patients with DIC.",

However, this patient has additional clinical manifestations that are not caused by complications of heparin therapy, including acute-onset fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.

    "hint": "Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, inhibit the Na^+/K^+/2Cl^- cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and stimulate prostaglandin E (PGE) release (prostaglandins maintain renal blood flow by inducing vasodilation of the afferent arterioles).

Asexual budding spores (blastospores; example indicated by red overlay) arise along the sides of the pseudohyphae. Thick-walled solitary circular chlamydospores (resting stage of Candida; example indicated by green overlay) arise from the tips of the pseudohyphae.This coexistence of different morphological types (yeast cells, pseudohyphae, budding blastospores, and resting chlamydospores) is typical of Candida albicans.",

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a significant risk factor that predisposes to this condition, which typically manifests as a unilateral, invasive, maxillofacial infection with headache, facial pain, nasal discharge, and fever, as seen in this patient. Severe infections can lead to altered mental status (due to cerebral involvement), eschars (due to microvascular occlusion and resulting tissue necrosis), and cranial nerve palsies.\n\nThe diagnosis of mucormycosis is confirmed via identification of characteristic fungal organisms on histopathologic examination of biopsy tissue. Treatment involves surgical debridement and intravenous antifungal agents (e.g., amphotericin B).",

        "explanation_why": "Patients in an HHS typically present with marked hyperglycemia (serum glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL), which causes increased serum osmolality (> 320 mOsmol/kg H_2O). Ketone formation is usually negligible due to the presence of endogenous insulin. By contrast, in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), there is no endogenous insulin, and ketones are formed. If access to fluids is not restricted, sodium levels will remain low because of increased extracellular fluid volume caused by the hyperosmolar state. While bicarbonate is consumed rapidly in DKA, individuals with HHS often present with normal or mildly decreased serum bicarbonate levels (≥ 15 mEq/L). Treatment of HHS consists of electrolyte and fluid replacement, as well as insulin for hyperglycemia.",

Although the mechanism underlying this association is not entirely understood, chronic infection with H. pylori disrupts the physiology of the stomach mucosa, leading to increased stomach acid secretion and decreased expression of protective factors such as mucin. Although it is very possible that this patient's stomach was colonized by H. pylori, sudden gastrointestinal bleeding occurring after extensive burns suggests a different cause.",

Conditions that result in biliary stasis and/or hypoperfusion of the gallbladder such as trauma, surgery, total parenteral nutrition, multiple transfusions, which are also seen here, are risk factors for acalculous cholecystitis.\n\nImaging (ultrasonography or abdominal CT scan) would show a distended gallbladder with thickened walls, hyperdense bile (sludge), and pericholecystic fluid. Treatment includes antibiotics (with gram-negative and enteric coverage) and cholecystostomy for drainage, which is a less invasive approach for this critically ill patient.

NSAIDs that inhibit peripheral COX 1 activity (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) can injure the gastric mucosa and result in a peptic ulcer. Acetaminophen is not an NSAID but a nonopioid analgesic that selectively inhibits COX in the CNS. Acetaminophen is inactivated peripherally and does not affect peripheral COX activity.",

LVH subsequently results in increased LV oxygen demand, leading to myocardial ischemia, which manifests as angina, especially during periods of strenuous exercise or stress. The reduction in cardiac output during exertion also causes transient cerebral hypoperfusion, which explains her presyncopal symptoms.\n\nThe presence of symptoms with aortic stenosis (AS) is an indication for surgical repair, as symptomatic AS carries a poor prognosis.",

Her temperature is 40.4°C (104.7°F), pulse 174/minute, and blood pressure is 62/44 mm Hg. Examination shows oropharyngeal hyperemia and diffuse macular erythroderma. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

This patient should also receive antihypertensives (e.g., hydralazine) to control her blood pressure, and immediate delivery of the fetus following stabilization of the mother is indicated. The patient should also be monitored for signs of magnesium sulfate toxicity, including profound hyporeflexia, oliguria, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmia or arrest. In the event of magnesium toxicity, calcium gluconate can be given.

The ferrous ion is the site of oxygen binding in hemoglobin, so it is necessary to restore the correct oxidation state of iron for effective delivery of oxygen to peripheral tissues.

Nitrites oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin, which binds cyanide (forming the compound cyanomethemoglobin), thereby resuming oxidative phosphorylation and improving symptoms. Other important treatments include hydroxocobalamin, which binds cyanide to form the harmless compound cyanocobalamin, and sodium thiosulfate, which converts cyanide to thiocyanide, allowing for safe excretion.\n\nNitrite therapy is not recommended in patients with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, as inducing methemoglobinemia can worsen tissue hypoxia.",

Citrate is an anticoagulant that is central to the storage of blood products. During transfusion, citrate prevents activation of the clotting cascade by chelating free extracellular calcium (a necessary cofactor for many steps in the coagulation cascade), resulting in transient hypocalcemia post-transfusion. In patients with symptomatic hypocalcemia, as seen here, calcium replacement therapy must be administered.",

However, ionized (or free) calcium concentrations are regulated hormonally and thus will not be affected.

Symptoms include fever, flushing, pruritus, flank pain, dyspnea and a burning pain at the IV site; none of which are present in this patient.

Most antimalarial drugs act on the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite, especially the blood schizonts.

Fundoscopic examination shows bilateral optic disc swelling. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. A CT scan of the brain shows hypoattenuation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery with surrounding edema and a 1-cm midline shift to the right. Which of the following interventions is most likely to result in a decrease in this patient's intracranial pressure?",

    "hint": "Patients with large strokes are at increased risk of developing cerebral edema in the early post-stroke period. An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema can cause impaired consciousness, papilledema, and an increase in blood pressure with a reduction in heart rate (Cushing reflex).",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), depends on the ICP and the mean arterial pressure (CPP = MAP – ICP). In acute strokes, vasoregulation is often lost and adequate cerebral oxygenation depends directly on the mean arterial pressure. Aggressive blood pressure reduction in this patient should be avoided as it may result in reduced perfusion and increased secondary neurologic injury.",

        "explanation_why": "Cerebral perfusion is regulated by pCO_2  and patients with raised intracranial pressure who are mechanically ventilated can be managed with therapeutic hyperventilation. Hyperventilation leads to a reduction in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO_2) which leads to vasoconstriction with subsequent reduction in cerebral blood flow and fall in intracranial pressure. Current guidelines recommend titrating the respiratory rate to achieve a target pCO_2 of between 28–32 mm Hg.",

The underlying mechanism of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a delay between ventilatory changes and the detection of resultant changes in PaCO_2, which leads to cyclical hyperpnea and hypopnea due to inappropriate overcompensation of the perceived oxygen saturation state. This is depicted in the graph as episodic hyperpnea in response to low oxygen saturation and episodic hypopnea in response to high oxygen saturation. In addition to advanced heart failure, neurologic disorders that damage the respiratory center of the brain (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury) can also cause this pattern of breathing.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the delay between ventilatory changes and the detection of resultant changes in PaCO_2, including prolonged circulation time between the lungs and brain (which delays the detection of oxygenation changes by central chemoreceptors) and a decreased ability of the body to store CO_2 and O_2.",

Although naloxone has the highest affinity for the μ-receptor, it is a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist and binds all major opioid receptors (μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors). As naloxone binds and displaces opioids from opioid receptors, it reverses the symptoms of opioid intoxication, as seen by this patient's almost immediate improvement in breathing and level of consciousness after drug administration. Because naloxone has a shorter half-life than most opioids, patients should be monitored for the ongoing effects of opioid intoxication as naloxone is metabolized.",

The aortic arch and descending aorta are not affected. The right and left coronary, the innominate, the left common carotid, and the subclavian arteries originate from the true lumen (green overlay; false lumen is red overlay). Facial swelling is the result of venous congestion from compression of the superior vena cava (blue overlay) by the dilated ascending aorta.

In cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability (e.g., SBP < 90 mm Hg), thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) such as alteplase is indicated. Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment. Anticoagulation with heparin, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or apixaban is also appropriate treatment for patients with PE.

In addition to features of sympathetic overactivity, acute cocaine overdose can also cause hallucinations (including tactile hallucinations such as formication) and paranoid ideation. Benzodiazepines are used to treat acute cocaine overdose and alpha-1 blockers (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) are recommended to treat the associated hypertension. The use of beta blockers, especially nonselective beta blockers, in suspected cocaine overdose is controversial due to concerns about unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which can worsen hypertension and coronary vasospasm. Chronic use of cocaine can cause nasal septal perforation (if used intranasally), periportal hepatitis, acute pulmonary toxicity and crack lung (if inhaled), myocarditis, and pulmonary artery hypertension.",

Chronic mercury toxicity manifests with neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, erethism mercurialis (abnormal irritability), ataxia, and tremor. Various degrees of polyneuropathy may also be observed. Another common sign is gingival and/or buccal inflammation with a characteristic blue‑violet discoloration. This patient's history of working in a metal refinery further supports this diagnosis. Finally, treatment includes administering dimercaprol, a chelating agent used to reduce serum mercury levels. The chelating agents 2,3 dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) can also be used to lower mercury levels.\n\nLead poisoning would manifest with symptoms very similar to the ones in this case, including neuropsychiatric disturbances and anorexia. Dimercaprol is also the first-line treatment. However, this patient's prominent excess salivation, odynophagia, and gingival inflammation would not be expected in cases of lead poisoning.",

Chronic toxicity most often causes non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, chest pain, and headache. Neither acute nor chronic exposure cause gingivobuccal inflammation, tremor, or ataxia.

They most often occur in patients with known atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries or patients with atrial fibrillation in which an atrial thrombus has formed. An arterial embolus to the brain resulting from a pulmonary artery clot is unlikely, as the embolus must first traverse the small capillary beds of the lungs or pass through a patent foramen ovale (paradoxical embolism) before entering systemic arterial circulation.",

While the thrombolysis adequately dissolved the thrombus, it resulted in hemorrhagic stroke and increased intracranial pressure, as evidenced by her change in mental status and papilledema. In scenarios such as this where intracranial hemorrhage is suspected, thrombolytic therapy should immediately be discontinued, an emergent CT scan of the brain performed, and neurosurgery and/or neurology consulted. Thrombolysis reversal agents (e.g., antifibrinolytics, FFPs, cryoprecipitate) may also be considered.",

A drug is administered via a peripheral intravenous line that works primarily by increasing inositol trisphosphate concentrations in arteriolar smooth muscle cells. Eight hours later, the patient has pain at the right antecubital fossa. Examination shows the skin around the intravenous line site to be pale and cool to touch. After discontinuing the infusion, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent further tissue injury in this patient?",

The resulting arterial bleed is managed with a tourniquet prior to transport to the military treatment facility. On arrival, he is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His armor and clothing are removed. His pulse is 145/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 95/52 mm Hg. Pulmonary examination shows symmetric chest rise. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. There are multiple shrapnel wounds over the upper and lower extremities. A tourniquet is in place around the right upper extremity; the right proximal forearm has been amputated. One large-bore intravenous catheter is placed in the left antecubital fossa. Despite multiple attempts, medical staff is unable to establish additional intravenous access. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

This patient's airway (A) and breathing (B) have been assessed and are stable (conscious patient with symmetric chest rise, lungs clear to auscultation). Although hemorrhage control has been achieved with the application of a tourniquet, this patient's vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia) indicate circulatory (C) failure. Immediate administration of intravenous fluids in order to restore and maintain adequate tissue perfusion is vital. The standard trauma protocol of establishing intravenous access via two large-bore lines is not possible; one intravenous line is not sufficient for large-volume fluid resuscitation in this patient with life-threatening hemorrhage. Therefore, establishing intraosseous access is the most appropriate next step in management. Then, disability (D) is assessed via evaluation of the patient's neurological status, and exposure (E) of the patient is performed to allow a thorough evaluation.",

In this patient, blood loss has resulted in hypovolemia and decreased stroke volume. The heart rate increases (as a result of intracardiac and arterial baroreceptor reflexes) to help maintain cardiac output. Initially, this mechanism may be sufficient to compensate for volume loss; patients in class I hemorrhagic shock may be otherwise asymptomatic. As shock progresses, compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed by volume loss, resulting in further derangements in vital signs (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, hypoxemia) and damage to multiple organ systems.\n\nSee “Classification of hemorrhagic shock” table.",

            "description": "Baroreceptors are stretch receptors that are located in the carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch of the aorta. Baroreceptors sense minute blood pressure (BP) changes and send afferent signals to the brain stem (nucleus tractus solitarius) via the vagus nerve from the aortic arch and the glossopharyngeal nerve from the carotid sinus. The brainstem modulates autonomic outflow to alter the heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance to normalize BP (i.e., ↓ BP → sympathetic stimulation → ↑ HR, ↑ peripheral vascular resistance → ↑ BP; ↑ BP → parasympathetic stimulation → ↓ HR and ↓ peripheral vascular resistance → ↓BP). This pathway is known as the baroreflex.A prolonged decrease in BP also stimulates long-term homeostatic mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway (RAAS) and ADH secretion (↑ ADH release → ↓ water excretion by the kidneys → ↑ intravascular volume → ↑ BP).Chemoreceptors detect minute changes in pH and partial pressures of respiratory gases. Peripheral chemoreceptors, located in the carotid body and aortic body, are stimulated by a fall in pH and pO_2 or a rise in pCO_2, which occurs in hypoxia. Chemoreceptors send afferent signals to the brain stem (dorsal respiratory group) via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, which stimulates the respiratory centers of the brain, resulting in an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. Chemoreceptor stimulation also increases the sympathetic outflow to the heart.",

This occurs in the later phase of shock; it is not the first physiologic response. Blood loss in hemorrhagic shock results in poor tissue perfusion. Consequently, cells are unable to maintain aerobic metabolism and revert to anaerobic metabolism, a less efficient mechanism that causes increased production of lactic acid. Blood is simultaneously shunted away from the extremities to more vital organs, such as the heart and brain, thereby further decreasing the supply of oxygen to peripheral tissues.",

Myocarditis and myocardial infarction are known complications of this condition that can manifest with chest pain and features of cardiac decompensation (e.g., dyspnea, bilateral rales, distended neck veins). However, a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease requires further specific symptoms, such as erythema and edema of the hands and feet, polymorphous rash, conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and oropharyngeal mucositis. Moreover, this condition most commonly affects children under the age of 5 years, so it is an unlikely diagnosis in a 55-year-old man.",

Once the pericardial effusion becomes sufficiently pronounced, either due to the rate of fluid accumulation or the amount of fluid, the heart can become compressed, which decreases cardiac output and ventricular diastolic filling. This patient presents with the classic symptoms of cardiac tamponade: hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds (i.e., Beck triad) as well as a characteristic ECG finding of low-voltage QRS complexes and fluctuating R wave amplitude (i.e., electrical alternans).",

This leads to a rapid increase in antibodies that bind to donor RBCs and causes extravascular hemolysis.

Activation occurs after exposure to soluble factors (anti-leukocyte antibodies or lipids) in the donor blood. The result is diffuse damage of pulmonary endothelial cells, which leads to leakage of interstitial fluid into the alveoli, causing an ARDS-like reaction with respiratory distress, fever, hypoxemia, and diffuse infiltrates on chest x-ray, as seen in this patient.",

Alpha-1 blockade causes peripheral vasodilation, which decreases blood pressure. Beta-1 receptor blockade decreases cardiac contractility and renin secretion, which further lowers blood pressure. In addition, beta-1 blockade decreases heart rate by causing sinoatrial and AV node depression.\n\nCarvedilol and the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker diltiazem can cause a similar decrease in both blood pressure and heart rate. Antihypertensives that only have a vasodilatory effect (e.g., hydralazine, nitroprusside, nicardipine, fenoldopam) cause an increase in heart rate (reflex tachycardia).",

    "hint": "This patient has an aortic dissection, a condition that is typically precipitated by systemic hypertension and manifests with sudden-onset tearing or stabbing chest pain that radiates to the back. Aortic dissection may result in aortic regurgitation (due to involvement of the aortic valve), which causes an early diastolic murmur that is heard best at the right upper sternal border.",

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous sodium nitroprusside therapy can be used to control hypertension in patients with an aortic dissection. However, the first-line medical therapy for aortic dissection is an intravenous beta blocker, which decreases shearing forces in the aorta by lowering the heart rate and the left ventricular ejection fraction. Intravenous sodium nitroprusside therapy alone will induce reflex tachycardia (via activation of the sympathetic nervous system), which increases shearing forces in the aorta and may worsen the dissection.",

The next most appropriate step in management is an aortic imaging study to establish the diagnosis and classify the dissection.

On arrival, he is unresponsive to painful stimuli. Physical examination shows fixed and bilaterally dilated pupils and an open head wound with visible brain matter in the left occipital region. After transfer to the neurocritical care unit, two full neurological examinations and an apnea test are performed, and brainstem reflexes are absent. The patient is declared brain dead. The attending neurosurgeon speaks to the family and explains the meaning of brain death and that the patient will not recover. His family members say they are hopeful because the patient still moves his fingers when they speak to him or touch his hand. Despite a thorough explanation by the physician that the movements do not indicate brain function, the family believes the patient will recover. Life support is continued while the health care team and the family attempt to reach an agreement. After further argument, the family threatens legal action and says they will physically prevent staff from withdrawing life support, if necessary. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

Recommendations also emphasize an empathetic approach that meets the family's emotional needs and tries to reach a mutual understanding.\n\nAlthough it is medically appropriate to discontinue life-supporting measures after brain death, and the physician is not obligated to obtain the family’s permission, life support may be continued briefly to allow the family time to visit the patient and come to terms with the diagnosis. If disagreement persists despite these accommodations, further steps (e.g., consulting the ethics committee) may be necessary.",

She has a history of bronchial asthma with frequent hospitalizations for status asthmaticus. During her last hospitalization 2 months ago, she was mechanically ventilated for 10 days in the intensive care unit. When she was discharged from the hospital 4 weeks ago, she felt well. Since then, she has developed slowly worsening dyspnea on exertion and is now dyspneic at rest. Her symptoms continued to worsen despite the administration of nebulized bronchodilators and oral corticosteroids. Her temperature is 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 22/min and labored, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Physical examination shows accessory respiratory muscle use. There is inspiratory stridor. Pulmonary examination shows bilaterally diminished breath sounds and no wheezing. Cardiac and abdominal examinations show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

Pressure from the endotracheal tube causes local tissue ischemia, inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis, leading to laryngeal stenosis, while an overinflated cuff will cause tracheal stenosis through a similar mechanism. Pulmonary function testing may demonstrate fixed upper airway obstruction, but definitive diagnosis requires laryngoscopy.",

        "explanation_why": "Progressively worsening dyspnea in a patient with a history of poorly controlled asthma now presenting with signs of respiratory distress (tachypnea, accessory muscle use, low oxygen saturation) should raise suspicion for an exacerbation of asthma. However, asthma is a lower airway disease; it manifests with wheezing rather than the inspiratory stridor seen here, which indicates upper airway obstruction. Moreover, although total serum IgE concentration has been shown to correlate with disease activity, it is not routinely used to diagnose exacerbations. This patient's lack of response to nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids further reduces the likelihood of an asthma diagnosis; her recent history of prolonged intubation suggests another condition.",

However, angioedema causes acute and rapidly worsening dyspnea and inspiratory stridor due to laryngeal edema, while this patient presents with slowly worsening dyspnea. Moreover, abdominal-related symptoms (e.g., colicky pain, vomiting, diarrhea) and swelling of the face, extremities, and genitalia, would be expected.

He is mechanically ventilated with supplemental oxygen. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Examination shows reduced breath sounds and absent tactile fremitus over the left hemithorax. An x-ray of the chest shows loss of lung volume, a moderate mediastinal shift to the left, and a wedge-shaped opacity in the left lower lobe. Positive end-expiratory pressure is increased to 8 cm H_2O. Three days later, an x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. Which of the following best explains this patient's pulmonary findings?",

His improvement, as visualized by the normal chest x-ray days after increasing PEEP, further supports this diagnosis. Postoperative pain can interfere with spontaneous deep breathing and coughing, which can lead to hypoxemia and airway collapse. Further, airway obstruction (due to retained pulmonary secretions) leads to resorption of gas by pulmonary capillaries, which can cause the collapse of nonventilated alveoli distal to the bronchial occlusion (i.e., resorptive atelectasis). However, increased positive pressure can reopen the collapsed alveoli by stenting open the airways, providing the lung expansion that the patient is unable to achieve by themself. Patients who smoke and/or have COPD, like this patient, are particularly at risk for postoperative atelectasis. Preoperative smoking cessation and medical optimization are key to prevention.\n\nOther types of atelectasis include nonobstructive and rounded.",

This condition is characterized by AV dissociation, in which the atria (P waves) and the ventricles (QRS complexes) beat independently of one another. Third-degree AV blocks occur due to impaired conduction at the level of the AV node (∼ 20%), bundle of His, or below the His bundle (most common; ∼ 60%). A block above the His bundle is associated with narrow QRS complexes (< 120 ms), while a block below the His bundle is characterized by wide QRS complexes. Additionally, the atrial rate is greater than the ventricular rate (i.e., more P waves than QRS complexes) and both atrial and ventricular rates are constant.\n\nThird-degree AV block may complicate an inferior MI (because the AV node and His bundle are primarily supplied by the right coronary artery) or an anterior MI (because the His bundle may receive blood from the septal branches of the left coronary artery). Other causes of third-degree AV block include infections (e.g., Lyme disease, bacterial endocarditis), cardiomyopathy, hyperkalemia, and iatrogenic effects (e.g., cardiac interventions, drugs such as beta-blockers).",

Immediately after being knocked over, he had pain in his right lower thoracic region. Twenty minutes later, he became dizzy. His wife says he has no history of previous illness and takes no medications. On arrival, he barely responds to painful stimuli. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 76/62 mm Hg. No source of bleeding is seen besides small lacerations on his extremities. There is a significant ecchymosis in the right lower thoracic region and the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Chest auscultation shows no abnormalities. Peripheral venous access is established, blood samples for crossmatching and blood gas analysis are drawn, and rapid infusion of Ringer lactate (RL) solution is initiated. The patient is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. A FAST scan of the abdomen discloses blood in the hepatorenal recess. After the administration of 1000 mL of RL solution, the patient's blood pressure is 80/64 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

If available, fully crossmatched pRBCs are preferable for this purpose. Early resuscitation with blood reestablishes hemoglobin levels and, therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the intravascular volume. The reestablished capacity prevents organ ischemia and associated metabolic acidosis, both of which can complicate shock. If hemorrhage is extensive and the patient continues to be hemodynamically unstable, plasma and platelets should be transfused in addition to pRBCs at a 1:1:1 ratio. Transfusion of these blood products counters the risk of developing coagulopathy, which is another complication of shock associated with acidosis, hypothermia, trauma itself, fibrinolysis, and dilution due to fluid transfusion. In addition to transfusion of pRBCs, management of this patient should include immediate transfer to the operating room for laparotomy.",

During the CUF phase, the priority is to return suppression fire and take cover. The only medical intervention indicated in this phase is the application of a combat tourniquet if there is ongoing hemorrhage. The TFC phase is entered when the military unit is not (or no longer) under hostile fire, which is the case here; the medic provides care according to the MARCH algorithm (Massive hemorrhage, Airway, Respiration, Circulation, and Head injury/Hypothermia) because the most common cause of death on the battlefield is uncontrolled hemorrhage. The first step in the management of this patient is to control hemorrhage  (e.g., with a combat tourniquet). The TEC phase includes care provided during the transport from the battlefield to the nearest medical facility. TEC includes the continuation of interventions initiated during TFC, assessment for additional life-threatening injuries, pain control, fluid resuscitation, and initiate antibiotic therapy.",

    "question_text": "A 68-year-old man with bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes is brought to the emergency department by his wife because of altered mental status. The wife says that he is “not his usual self” and responded with nonsensical phrases when she awoke him for breakfast. She adds that, after both nephrostomy tubes were exchanged 4 days ago, the urine output from the right nephrostomy bag was relatively low, and that he complained of right flank pain yesterday. He has prostate cancer and receives leuprolide injections every 3 months. He appears uncomfortable and diaphoretic. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 124/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 76/50 mm Hg when supine. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. The right nephrostomy bag contains a small amount of cloudy urine; the left nephrostomy bag contains clear urine. Hemoglobin concentration is 12 g/dL, leukocyte count is 22,000/mm^3, platelet count is 180,000/mm^3, and serum lactic acid concentration is 4.2 mmol/L (N < 2). In the emergency department, a central venous catheter is placed and hemodynamic monitoring shows:\n\nPulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)\n\n4 mm Hg (N = 5–16)\n\nSystemic vascular resistance (SVR)\n455 dynes.sec/cm^5 (N = 900–1400)\n\nCardiac index\n5.3 L/min/m^2 (N = 2.5–4.2)\n\nMixed oxygen venous saturation (SvO_2)\n81% (N = 65–70)\n\nThe results of blood and urine cultures are pending. Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy are initiated. After 2.5 L of 0.9% saline infusion, his blood pressure is 78/54 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?",

He has prostate cancer and receives leuprolide injections every 3 months. He appears uncomfortable and diaphoretic. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 124/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 76/50 mm Hg when supine. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. The right nephrostomy bag contains a small amount of cloudy urine; the left nephrostomy bag contains clear urine. Hemoglobin concentration is 12 g/dL, leukocyte count is 22,000/mm3, platelet count is 180,000/mm3, and serum lactic acid concentration is 4.2 mmol/L (N &lt; 2). In the emergency department, a central venous catheter is placed and hemodynamic monitoring shows: Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 4 mm Hg (N = 5–16) Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) 455 dynes.sec/cm5 (N = 900–1400) Cardiac index 5.3 L/min/m2 (N = 2.5–4.2) Mixed oxygen venous saturation (SvO2) 81% (N = 65–70) The results of blood and urine cultures are pending. Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy are initiated. After 2.5 L of 0.9% saline infusion, his blood pressure is 78/54 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?",

    "hint": "This patient meets the qSOFA criteria for septic shock (≥ 2 of the following: altered mental status, systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mm Hg, respiratory rate ≥ 22/min) and has persistent hypotension (i.e., failure to maintain a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mm Hg during or after fluid resuscitation). The underlying etiology is likely urinary infection of the right nephrostomy tube secondary to obstruction.",

However, neurogenic shock typically results in bradycardia with low cardiac output and low SvO_2 (due to higher O_2 extraction rate because of slower peripheral blood flow). Moreover, this patient does not have a history of traumatic brain or spinal cord injury, which would be expected in neurogenic shock. In septic shock, phenylephrine may be used as a second-line pharmacotherapy.",

However, it is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment for septic and cardiogenic shock because of the higher risk of tachyarrhythmia and possible mortality.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Norepinephrine (NE) is the vasopressor of choice in patients with septic shock and persistent hypotension. In septic shock, circulating cytokines and bacterial toxins cause pathologic vasodilation and lead to decreased SVR (afterload) and PCWP (preload). Consequently, there is an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. High SvO_2 can occur in 2 out of 3 forms of distributive shock (i.e., septic and anaphylactic shock) due to peripheral microcirculatory shunting and a subsequent lower O_2 extraction rate. NE causes α1-mediated vasoconstriction, which results in increased SVR (afterload). However, cardiac output is typically maintained because of β1-mediated inotropy balancing this increase in afterload.\n\nThe absence of fever in this patient does not rule out sepsis. Patients with sepsis are often normothermic (especially if elderly or very young). In fact, if patients meet the sepsis criteria (i.e., ≥ 2 of the qSOFA criteria are present) and have normothermia or hypothermia, they should be treated more aggressively since the prognosis is poorer in these patients.",

However, the onset of anaphylactic shock is typically within minutes to hours of exposure to a likely antigen, and other findings (e.g., urticaria, abdominal pain) are typically present.

Inhibition of cardiac fast sodium channels due to an overdose of TCAs can result in cardiotoxicity. The width of the QRS complexes, which corresponds to the likelihood of developing ventricular arrhythmias and seizures, indicates the severity of intoxication. Sodium bicarbonate is used to counter the cardiotoxic effects of TCAs and is indicated in patients with QRS ≥ 100 ms or ventricular arrhythmias. If an airway is established, activated charcoal can be administered within 2 hours of ingestion to prevent further absorption of TCAs. When TCA overdose is suspected but medications are unknown, a urine immunoassay can help establish the diagnosis. This test should not delay further management (e.g., airway establishment, fluid resuscitation, ECG).\n\nTo rule out hypoglycemia, measuring capillary blood glucose levels is indicated in all patients with altered mental status.

The patient and her partner were at a techno rave party before her symptoms started and they both took ecstasy. She works as a sales manager at a pharmaceutical company; she has been under a lot of stress lately and has been sleeping poorly. She reports that she “just wanted to blow off some steam”. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 127/71 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mydriasis and mild diaphoresis. ECG shows absent P waves. The patient is admitted to the hospital for observation. Follow-up ECG 2 hours later shows normal P waves and narrow QRS complexes. She says that she feels better but still feels occasional palpitations. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

While controlling rate and/or rhythm, as well as providing anticoagulation (according to CHA_2DS_2-VASc score), are the key therapeutic principles in this condition, the patient's spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm and her CHA_2DS_2-VASc score of 1 indicate that no further management (i.e., medical or electrophysiological intervention), aside from observation, is necessary at this time. Nonetheless, underlying causes of Afib (such as structural heart disease, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalances) should be investigated.",

She sustained burns after spilling boiling hot water on herself while cooking. She was admitted for fluid resuscitation, nutritional support, pain management, and wound care; she was doing well until today. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition via a central venous catheter. She has no other medical conditions. She is oriented to person only. Her temperature is 35.1°C (95.2°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 31/min, blood pressure is 96/59 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 93% on 5 L oxygen/min via face mask. Examination shows extensive partial-thickness burns across her lower abdomen and legs and some full-thickness burns. The lesions are tender and have violaceous and edematous borders. The skin around the central venous catheter site appears normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

Patients with burns have an increased risk of infection and subsequent bacteremia due to impaired barrier function of the skin and immunosuppression; the risk increases with the severity of the burn and the amount of body surface area involved. In addition, this patient's burn consists of necrotic tissue, which is a protein-rich media that encourages bacterial growth. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus are the most common organisms associated with sepsis in hospitalized burn patients, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be initiated.",

Furthermore, pheochromocytoma can be associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF type 1), which can manifest with skin depigmentation. However, patients with NF type 1 typically develop hyperpigmented macules of patches (café au lait spots), rather than diffuse (salt-and-pepper) hypopigmentation. Moreover, pheochromocytoma is typically associated with diaphoresis, palpitations, and pallor, none of which are seen here.

        "explanation_why": "Antihypertensive therapy is the most appropriate initial approach for patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) because blood pressure control stabilizes and improves renal function. SRC can rapidly progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), so therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are the first-line therapy given their antihypertensive efficacy and nephroprotective effects. Captopril is the most commonly used ACEI because it has a rapid onset and short duration of action, which allows for rapid dose titration. Serum creatinine should be monitored and captopril therapy should be continued despite an initial increase in serum creatinine, which is expected and typically transient. Given their associated increase in survival, long-acting ACEIs (e.g., ramipril, enalapril) should be continued indefinitely in patients who have developed SRC, regardless of their blood pressure values. Patients who develop ESRD despite ACEI therapy may require temporary or permanent renal replacement therapy.",

She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Preadmission medications include candesartan, salmeterol, budesonide, and pravastatin. Upon admission, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated because she was unconscious. Over the past 12 hours, her end-expiratory airway pressure was increased to ensure adequate oxygenation. Her current temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 114/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 140/92 mm Hg. An x-ray of the chest shows new alveolar infiltrates and air bronchograms in the right lower lobe. Which of the following measures is most likely to have prevented this patient's current condition?",

    "hint": "Tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and new infiltrates on chest x-ray after being intubated for more than 48 hours indicate ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is most often caused by microaspiration of bacterial flora from the oral cavity or stomach.",

Therefore, a change in the ventilator circuit is recommended if it is visibly soiled, malfunctioning, or if a new patient is ventilated. However, frequent changes of the ventilator circuit for the same patient increase rather than decrease the risk of VAP because manipulation of the ventilator circuit increases the risk of microaspiration of subglottic secretions.",

        "explanation_why": "Sedatives are used in mechanically ventilated patients to relieve discomfort and anxiety and, if a spontaneous ventilatory mode is unavailable, to prevent complications arising from patient-ventilator asynchrony. However, excessive sedation impairs the patient's airway protective reflexes and allows oropharyngeal secretions or gastric reflux to pass beyond the glottis. In intubated patients, these collections can pool in the subglottic region and drain around the endotracheal tube cuff, as microaspirates, into the lower respiratory tract. Using sedation assessment tools and daily titration of the patient's depth of sedation to the minimum necessary level (sedation vacation) can prevent the subglottic pooling of secretions and subsequent VAP. Sedation vacations also prevent VAP by facilitating spontaneous breathing trials and early ventilator weaning.\n\nVAP can also be prevented by measures that decrease oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal bacterial colonization (e.g., oral chlorhexidine rinses, avoiding unnecessary acid suppression therapy), decrease subglottic pooling (e.g., oropharyngeal and subglottic suctioning, semirecumbent positioning of the patient), and decrease the risk of microaspiration (e.g., minimizing patient transport, avoiding frequent ventilator circuit changes for the same patient).",

While avoiding overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff prevents airway injury (e.g., ischemia, ulceration, and necrosis of the tracheal wall), it does not prevent VAP.",

She is in the military reserve and was involved in active combat 2 weeks ago, during which she sustained multiple gunshot wounds to her left lower leg resulting in irreversible limb ischemia. She is currently taking oral acetaminophen, which has provided minimal pain relief. The patient has a history of bronchial asthma for which she uses an albuterol inhaler. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 123/75 mm Hg. Physical examination of the residual limb shows mild erythema and drainage of a scant amount of serous fluid from the sutured wound. Muscle strength in the hip and upper leg is normal bilaterally. Sensation to pain and temperature is normal in the left upper leg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He was brought to the emergency department 4 hours ago after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, he was oriented to person, place, and time. During the procedure, he received 6 units of packed red blood cells, 1 unit of platelets, and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma. On admission to the postoperative ward, his vitals were within normal limits. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Now, his temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 78%. Bibasilar crackles are heard on auscultation. Chest x-ray shows diffuse, bilateral infiltrates. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's deterioration?",

        "explanation_why": "Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a transfusion reaction caused by the activation of the recipient's granulocytes by soluble factors (e.g., antibodies) in the donor's blood. Activated granulocytes release proinflammatory mediators that increase the vascular permeability, resulting in plasma transudation into the pulmonary interstitium and consequent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. TRALI typically occurs during or within 6 hours of transfusion. Patients usually present with hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, features of pulmonary edema (e.g., crackles, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray), and signs of hypovolemia (hypotension, tachycardia). Signs of hypovolemia distinguish TRALI from transfusion-associated circulatory overload, which, in contrast to TRALI, characteristically manifests with findings of volume overload (e.g., elevated blood pressure, S3 gallop, jugular venous distension). Immediate cessation of any ongoing transfusion followed by supportive treatment with respiratory and circulatory support is recommended.",

No pleural effusions are visible (indicated by red overlay). The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. A right central line is present (yellow outline). The radiopaque line on a nasogastric tube (blue overlay) can be traced into the mid-thorax, beyond which it is not well seen.Nonspecific homogeneous or heterogeneous opacities may become visible on chest radiographs in various locations about 24–48 hours after an insult that results in pulmonary fat embolism. A normal cardiac silhouette size and absence of Kerley lines, pleural effusions, and pulmonary venous hypertension can help exclude a diagnosis of cardiogenic edema.",

    "hint": "The onset of fever and hemodynamic instability ≥ 48 hours after the insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC) and the growth of the same organism on blood cultures from the CVC and a peripheral vein with a differential time to positivity ≥ 120 minutes indicate a central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), even if the CVC's exit site does not show evidence of infection (e.g., tenderness, purulence).

        "explanation_why": "Maintenance of negative ambient air pressure is an example of an airborne precaution, which is effective in preventing in-hospital airborne transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, or varicella. P. aeruginosa is spread via contact transmission; standard precautions and contact precautions are effective in preventing nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections but airborne precautions are not. Moreover, in intensive care units, especially ones caring for immunosuppressed patients, a protective environment with a positive rather than negative ambient air pressure is usually maintained (neutropenic precautions).",

        "content": "Implementation of real-time feedback loops for hand hygiene compliance",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The most common mechanism for CLABSI is microbial spread (via surface motility and/or biofilm formation) to the CVC exit site from the patient's skin and/or the CVC hub. The hands of health care providers (HCPs) are often colonized by pathogens, resulting in HCPs cross-contaminating patients, other HCPs, and inanimate objects (leading to contact transmission), thereby facilitating nosocomial infections. Strict adherence to hand hygiene measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial infections such as CLABSI. Despite high numbers of hand hygiene stations and visual reminders at hospitals, the level of hand hygiene compliance among HCPs remains low because of lapses (due to work overload), poor situational awareness, and/or intolerance or aversion to certain disinfectants. An effective measure to increase compliance is a real-time feedback loop, in which hand hygiene observers or electronic hand hygiene systems monitor compliance and provide immediate feedback (e.g., verbal feedback on improper technique, data visualization of each hospital floor's hand hygiene process measures). Additional steps to increase hand hygiene compliance include staff training and providing alcohol-based foam rubs (which are quicker to use, more effective, and no more irritating to the skin than soap and water) at hand hygiene stations.\n\nCLABSI bundles (a collection of measures to prevent CLABSI) include proper site identification and technique for CVC insertion (e.g., avoiding the femoral region whenever possible), standardized checklists, and aseptic precautions (e.g., sterile glove use, disinfection with chlorhexidine) for CVC insertion as well as CVC site care, CVC removal as soon as possible, and champions-led rounding. These measures are important adjuncts but not substitutes for hand hygiene.",

Moreover, femoral CVCs are more likely to result in CLABSIs with gram-negative bacilli and Candida because the groin area has high levels of colonization by these microbes (due to factors such as moisture in intertriginous areas and proximity to the anogenital region) and is harder to keep clean.

However, antibiotics are ineffective in the primary prevention of CLABSI and do not have a role before or during CVC insertion (e.g., through the introducer needle).

The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, and not receiving any paralytic or sedative medications. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows dilated, nonreactive pupils and absent corneal, gag, and cough reflexes. There is no eye movement upon irrigation of the external auditory canal with cold water. She does not respond to painful stimuli applied to the shins, sternum, and temporomandibular joint. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the right ankle and 2+ in the left biceps. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference range. Urinary toxicology screening is negative. The apnea test is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The absence of the pupillary reflex, vestibuloocular reflex, corneal reflex, gag reflex, and cough reflex indicate brainstem areflexia, which is one of the criteria for brain death. The presence of cardiac activity and spontaneous or reflex motor responses as a result of bioelectrical activity restricted to the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and muscles (e.g., deep tendon reflexes, Babinski sign, fasciculations, myoclonus) should not be interpreted as evidence against brain death.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "To determine brain death, a physician must first identify evidence of a known cause for irreversible brain damage (e.g., a massive epidural hematoma on imaging) and exclude confounders (e.g., sedative/paralytic use, drug intoxication, severe metabolic derangements, hypotension, hypothermia). The physician must then demonstrate via examination that the patient is comatose, does not have brain-mediated motor responses (e.g., decorticate or decerebrate posturing, facial grimacing) to noxious stimuli applied above and below the neck, has brainstem areflexia, and has a positive apnea test. Finally, the evaluation must be independently repeated by another physician and the findings on reevaluation must be in concordance with the first physician's findings. For children and patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, an observation period is required before the reevaluation. If all of these criteria are met, brain death can be declared without performing any ancillary testing.\n\nAncillary testing using a brain blood flow study (e.g., cerebral angiography, cerebral scintigraphy, transcranial Doppler) or an electrophysiological study (e.g., electroencephalography, evoked potentials) is indicated if any of the aforementioned criteria are not met, if any of the steps of the examination cannot be performed or yield inconclusive results, and for children below 1 year of age. If organ procurement from the patient is being considered, none of the physicians involved in determining brain death can be involved in the organ transplantation process or care of the organ recipient.",

    "hint": "This patient presents with persistent vomiting and dehydration (e.g., decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, increased serum osmolality) following chemotherapy. His blood gas analysis is consistent with metabolic alkalosis (increased pH and HCO_3^-) with respiratory compensation (increased pCO_2). The metabolic alkalosis is the result of volume depletion (contraction alkalosis) and loss of gastric H^+.",

        "explanation_why": "Hyponatremia can occur in patients with protracted vomiting if the net sodium loss exceeds the net free water loss, typically due to alterations in renal Na^+ handling induced by persistent contraction alkalosis. However, in such a scenario, serum osmolality would be decreased (hypotonic hypovolemic hyponatremia). The increased serum osmolality in this dehydrated patient indicates a free water loss in excess of sodium loss, so hypernatremia would be expected. Hypernatremia occurs following vomiting because gastric secretions have a lower Na^+ concentration (approx. 20–100 mEq/L) when compared to plasma.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The characteristic finding associated with persistent vomiting or excessive nasogastric (NG) suctioning is hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia in contraction alkalosis is caused by several mechanisms. The primary driver is hypovolemia-induced RAAS activation and aldosterone release, which promotes renal K^+  and H^+ excretion and thereby further contributes to both hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Furthermore, in alkalemia, extracellular K^+ is driven into the cell in exchange for intracellular H^+ (via Na^+/H^+ antiporter and Na^+/K^+-ATPase) to compensate for high blood pH levels. Persistent vomiting or excessive NG suctioning also causes loss of K^+ in excess of free water loss; gastric secretions have a higher concentration of K^+ (approx. 10–15 mEq/L) when compared to plasma due to K^+ leakage via KCNE2/KCNQ1 channels on the lumen of parietal cells.\n\nTreatment of contraction alkalosis (a chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis) consists of fluid therapy with 0.9% NaCl to correct the extracellular volume loss and replete chloride, thereby ensuring adequate Cl^- delivery to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Adequate Cl^- delivery to the DCT is necessary for the activity of the pendrin exchanger, which reabsorbs Cl^- in exchange for excreting HCO_3^- into the lumen of the DCT. Correction of the volume status usually also corrects any mild electrolyte disturbances, but for moderate to severe electrolyte disturbances, it may be necessary to take further measures (e.g., repletion with potassium chloride for severe hypokalemia). See “Acid-base disturbances associated with GI disorders” table.",

The storage of 1:1000 preparations of epinephrine (only used in anaphylaxis and for intramuscular injection) in epinephrine autoinjectors guarantees the correct route of administration of this highly concentrated epinephrine preparation. This forcing function would have prevented the medication error that resulted in a lethal complication in this scenario (i.e., a never event) by making it impossible to administer this epinephrine preparation via the intravascular route.\n\nOther examples of forcing functions include design features that only allow one health care record to be open on a computerized physician order entry system to prevent wrong-patient errors and providing different hub fits for intravenous injections of high-risk medications (e.g., opiates) to prevent administration of the wrong drug.",

    "question_text": "A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance 30 minutes after having fallen from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. Emergency medical technicians arrived at the scene of injury 10 minutes after the fall and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) en route to the hospital. On arrival, he is unconscious and has a Glasgow coma score of 3. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F) and he has nonpalpable pulses with asystole on ECG. CPR is continued and the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest auscultation discloses clear lung fields with bilateral air entry and absent heart sounds. Point of care ultrasound shows visible sliding of the pleura and no cardiac wall motion. There is no evidence of fluid in the pericardium, ventricular dilation, or inferior vena cava collapse. Arterial blood gas analysis on 100% oxygen shows a pH of 7.36 and an oxygen saturation of 99%. Despite continuing CPR for another 20 minutes, the ECG recordings persistently show asystole. The pupils are 9 mm and nonreactive to light. End-tidal carbon dioxide is 8 mm Hg (N = 35–45) and serum electrolyte concentrations are within normal limits. Two emergency medicine residents in their first postgraduate year ask the attending physician if they can practice femoral vein catheterization and scalpel cricothyroidotomy on the patient. There are no advance directives or emergency medical contacts in the patient's electronic health record. At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate instruction by the attending physician to the team treating the patient?",

    "hint": "In this patient, reversible causes of posttraumatic cardiac arrest (e.g., tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, exsanguination, asphyxiation) have been excluded. Before making a decision, the attending physician must consider the following scenario-specific features: high-energy trauma, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, late initiation of CPR, a cumulative CPR time > 30 minutes without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or a rhythm change at any point, end-tidal CO_2  < 10 mm Hg, and an examination finding suggestive of brainstem areflexia.",

Performing procedures on newly deceased patients can provide valuable hands-on training for inexperienced health care providers. However, consent from the next of kin is required for each procedure if the deceased's preferences are not known. According to the Uniform Anatomical Gifts Act, in the absence of an advance directive or emergency medical contacts in the patient's records, emergency physicians and medical technicians are allowed to search through the patient's belongings and may share their personal information (e.g., social security number) with authorities to identify them.\n\nIf the next of kin cannot be located within a reasonable time frame, it is ethically inappropriate to use the body of a deceased patient for training purposes, regardless of the degree of invasiveness of the procedure. If consent is obtained, the training procedures should be organized systematically and conducted under close supervision while ensuring a respectful environment for the deceased and their family.",

His only medication is primidone for essential tremor. During the past year, he drank five alcoholic beverages daily but stopped 6 months ago. On arrival, he appears lethargic. Temperature is 35.2°C (95.4°F), pulse is 65/min, respirations are 10/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 100/59 mm Hg. On examination, he does not open his eyes and makes incomprehensible sounds. He pushes the examiner's hand away when a painful stimulus is applied. Pupils are 3 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in all extremities.

    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "This patient's respiratory depression, hypotension, sluggish pupillary light reflex, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 8 (Eye opening response = 1, Verbal response = 2, Motor response = 5) is consistent with barbiturate overdose. Primidone is a long-acting barbiturate.",

However, it should be administered within two hours of ingestion, and this patient's ingestion time is unknown. Furthermore, there is debate over whether it is effective even when administered immediately after ingestion of medicine. Moreover, flumazenil is used in the treatment of overdose with benzodiazepines, not barbiturates.",

Overdose of opioids can also manifest with altered consciousness, lethargy, respiratory depression, and hypotension. However, the absence of other clinical features consistent with opioid overdose (e.g., miosis) in this patient combined with his history of barbiturate use makes another etiology likely. A different step in management is therefore needed.",

This patient's GCS of 8 and respiratory depression indicate the need for respiratory assistance (e.g., oropharyngeal airway, laryngeal mask, or endotracheal intubation). Urine alkalinization with intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO_3), which increases renal elimination of weak acids such as barbiturates, is indicated for emergent management of barbiturate intoxication. Patients with barbiturate intoxication should also receive further supportive measures, including fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability, immediate ECG followed by telemetry to monitor for arrhythmias, and arterial blood gas analysis to assess for metabolic acidosis and increased serum lactic acid. There is no specific antidote for barbiturate overdose.",

He had a similar episode 3 hours ago, which resolved spontaneously after 10 minutes. Both episodes began shortly after he was repositioned in his bed. One week ago, he was brought to the emergency department in an unresponsive state after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hematoma and the patient was transferred to the operating room for an emergency craniotomy with hematoma evacuation. Since his arrival to the intensive care unit after the procedure, he has remained intubated and mechanically ventilated, and his vital signs have been stable. His medical history is unavailable. He appears diaphoretic. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 155/min, and blood pressure is 160/94 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. The pupils are equal and reactive bilaterally. The cranial surgical site is dry. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is a complication of TBI that is thought to be caused by the loss of inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system due to cortical injury. It usually manifests about one week after the inciting event with recurrent episodes of hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, diaphoresis, muscle spasms, and possibly dystonia with posturing. PSH episodes can occur spontaneously or be triggered by external stimulants, such as patient repositioning or extraction of the endotracheal tube. Episodes typically last up to 30 minutes and are self-limiting.\n\nPSH is a clinical diagnosis. Other diagnostic tests (e.g., EEG, head CT/MRI) can be considered to rule out other diagnoses. Management is conservative and varies according to the constellation of symptoms. Opioids (e.g., morphine, fentanyl), sympatholytics (e.g., clonidine, propranolol), benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam), and myorelaxants (e.g., dantrolene, baclofen) are commonly used to reduce symptoms of PSH.",

The siblings were playing outside in the garden of their grandparents. The brother reports that he went inside to get something to drink and discovered his sister floating in the pool when he returned. The grandfather took her out of the pool and called an ambulance. On arrival, paramedics found that the girl was somnolent but spontaneously breathing. On route to the hospital, they initiated bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 34.2°C (93.5°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 34/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen administered via a nonrebreather mask shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. There is no evidence of trauma to the head or neck; the lips appear bluish. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. The airway is clear. Pulmonary auscultation shows diffuse crackles and wheezing. Femoral pulses are palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Ensuring oxygenation is the most important goal in the management of submersion injury because aspirated fluid can damage the alveolar membranes and wash out surfactant, leading to hypoxia. In this patient who is tachypneic, somnolent, and unable to maintain an SpO_2 of 90% despite the use of a nonrebreather mask, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated to improve oxygenation and protect the airway. After intubation, an orogastric tube should be placed to relieve gastric distention caused by water that may have entered passively during submersion. Continuous ECG monitoring is necessary to assess for arrhythmias. Finally, wet clothes must be removed and the patient rewarmed.\n\nFor asymptomatic patients, continuous observation is required as submersion injuries can manifest with a delayed onset of symptoms. Submersion injuries in children can be prevented by safe practices and interventions (e.g., fencing off pools, use of life jackets, swimming lessons, adult supervision, lifeguards).",

On arrival, he is alert and oriented to person and place, but not time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a knife in situ that enters the thoracic wall just above the 7^th rib in the left midaxillary line. The right lung is clear to auscultation; auscultation of the left lung and cardiac examination remain inconclusive as the patient does not tolerate being examined near the entrance wound. Abdominal examination shows mild diffuse abdominal pain without guarding or rebound. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Five minutes later, the patient becomes unresponsive. Repeat vital signs are temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 120/min, respirations 28/min, and blood pressure 88/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In cases of hemodynamic instability where there is a strong clinical suspicion of cardiac tamponade (e.g., muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins) or tension pneumothorax (e.g., absent breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion on the ipsilateral side), emergency pericardiocentesis or tube thoracostomy, respectively, should not be delayed by imaging.",

    "question_text": "A 75-year-old man who is being treated in the hospital for new-onset congestive heart failure alerts his nurse because he is feeling unwell. He reports feeling dizzy and nauseous and that he had to lie down again after trying to stand up to go to the bathroom. He says that his symptoms began 30 minutes after he was brought back to the ward from the radiology department, where he underwent a CT scan of the chest to evaluate an incidental pulmonary nodule found on chest x-ray. Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease and hypertension. After admission, bisoprolol therapy was temporarily discontinued and he was started on furosemide. His other medications are aspirin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. The physician on call takes the patient’s vital signs and measures a pulse of 138/min and blood pressure of 95/70 mm Hg. Further investigation reveals that the changes in the patient's pulse and blood pressure were not detected despite continuous cardiac telemetry being a part of the patient's admission orders. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the error that occurred in this scenario?",

        "explanation_why": "When humans interact with medical equipment, three types of errors occur: human errors, device errors, and errors at the level of the device-human interface. Failure at the level of the device-human interface (e.g., disconnection of the patient from or improper connection of the patient to the telemetry device) is the most common cause of inpatient cardiac telemetry-related errors (approx. 50% of cases) and typically occurs after patients are shifted (e.g., for a test). Less common causes of inpatient cardiac telemetry-related errors are equipment malfunction (25%), communication breakdown (20%), and alarm fatigue (5%). Cardiac telemetry-related errors rarely cause patients to be harmed, but when they do, the consequences are dire with death as the most frequent outcome. Measures that can be taken to prevent such errors include checklists and standardization for inpatient transfers, regular telemetry equipment checks, forcing functions that prevent alarms from being turned down, and redirection of low-level alarms to telemetry technicians to prevent alarm fatigue in nurses.",

However, poor communication is not the most common cause of inpatient cardiac telemetry-related errors. A different cause is much more likely in this scenario, in which the cardiac event occurred soon after the patient returned to the ward.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "A churning sound in the precordial region (also known as the mill-wheel murmur) is consistent with air in the heart chambers. This finding is characteristic of venous air embolism. Other common features of this condition include sudden hypotension, tachycardia, jugular vein distension, signs of respiratory distress, and, in patients who are being mechanically ventilated, a sudden fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Venous air embolism develops when air enters the venous circulation. This can occur during neurosurgical procedures, especially those that require the patient to be in a sitting position. In this position, the negative (subatmospheric) pressure of the cranial veins due to them being at a higher level than the heart can result in air being sucked into the cranial veins. Other causes of venous air embolism include vascular interventions (e.g., insertion or removal of central venous catheters), penetrating lung injuries, and barotrauma. Management procedures depend on the suspected site of embolism and include compression of the suspected entry site, correction of hypoxia and hypotension, and placing the patient in a head-down position (e.g., Trendelenburg position) or in the left lateral decubitus position (Durant maneuver), both of which help trap the air emboli in the right ventricular apex and therefore prevent further obstruction of the pulmonary outflow tract. If the patient remains unstable following these procedures, direct aspiration of air through a central venous catheter may be considered.",

        "explanation_why": "Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a common complication of ischemic stroke and typically manifests with neurologic deterioration (e.g., new confusion, worsening neurological deficits) within 24–48 hours of the inciting ischemic event. The risk of hemorrhagic transformation is significantly increased in patients who have received thrombolytic medications (e.g., alteplase), antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel), and/or thrombosis prophylaxis (e.g., heparin, enoxaparin). Other risk factors for HT include hyperglycemia, hypertension, advanced age, delayed initiation of reperfusion therapy, and large infarct size. Measures that can reduce the rate of HT include neuroprotective measures (e.g., tight blood pressure and glycemic control, targeted temperature management) and careful preselection of patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy.",

On arrival, he is unresponsive. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial hemorrhage. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated and not receiving any paralytic or sedative medications. Temperature is 34.9°C (94.8°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 105/62 mm Hg after intravenous administration of norepinephrine. Neurological examination on admission shows dilated, nonreactive pupils and absent corneal, gag, and cough reflexes. There is no eye movement upon irrigation of the external auditory canal with cold water. A subsequent independent evaluation by another physician is concordant with these findings. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate action at this time?",

Core body temperature must be > 36.0°C (> 96.8°F) for a minimum of 24 hours because hypothermia may impede neurological assessment and delay the increase in pCO_2 in apnea testing. Normothermia can be achieved by covering the patient with warming blankets and/or administering warm intravenous fluids. Other causes of impaired brain function, such as poisoning, drug intoxication, electrolyte imbalances, and hypotension as well as conditions that can mimic brain death (e.g., locked-in syndrome) should be ruled out and corrected if possible. Systolic blood pressure must be > 100 mm Hg, which may require the administration of vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine). If these prerequisites are met and patients still present with coma and brainstem areflexia, apnea testing can be performed for a definitive diagnosis of brain death.",

PFO occurs in ∼ 25% of individuals and is typically asymptomatic until complications due to right-to-left shunting arise. Transient increases in right atrial pressures allow emboli originating from the venous system (e.g., DVT) to pass directly from the right atrium into the left atrium, and then into the systemic and cerebral arterial circulation. Management of PFO after an embolic stroke includes surgical or percutaneous closure of the defect, antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation, and evaluation for other potential causes of stroke (e.g., arrhythmia, hypercoagulability, endocarditis).\n\nParadoxical embolism can also be caused by a small atrial septal defect (ASD), which can be asymptomatic but typically manifests with a wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound on auscultation. Echocardiography is also the first-line modality in the diagnosis of ASD.",

In cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability (e.g., SBP < 90 mm Hg), thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) such as alteplase is indicated. Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment. Anticoagulation with heparin, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or apixaban is also appropriate treatment for patients with PE. However, these agents are typically used in patients who remain hemodynamically stable.",

    "question_text": "A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after sustaining multiple injuries in a motor vehicle collision. On arrival, he is responsive only to painful stimuli. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 132/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 78/49 mm Hg. Physical examination shows cool, clammy skin and absent radial pulses. Lung examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is initiated, but the patient's blood pressure remains low. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma shows a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen. The decision is made to intubate the patient for airway protection. Shortly after endotracheal intubation and initiation of positive pressure ventilation, the patient's blood pressure drops to 62/38 mm Hg, and his pulse rises to 148/min. Airway pressures are consistent, and lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical deterioration after intubation?",

        "explanation_why": "This patient with severe hypotension, tachycardia, cool clammy skin, and absent radial pulses is in hypovolemic shock, likely due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage resulting from the motor vehicle collision. Hypovolemia causes low preload, so the heart relies on high venous return to maintain cardiac output. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) increases intrathoracic pressure, which further impedes venous return to the right heart. In a patient who is already volume-depleted, this can cause a precipitous drop in cardiac output and blood pressure, manifesting with acute worsening of hypotension and tachycardia after intubation.\n\nAdequate volume resuscitation before and during intubation, using the lowest possible mean airway pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure, and close hemodynamic monitoring are essential when performing intubation and PPV in patients with shock.",

He was found at the scene with altered mental status and significant bleeding from a deep laceration on his left thigh. His medical and social history are unknown. On arrival, he appears pale and diaphoretic. He is unable to answer questions appropriately. His temperature is 36.2°C (97.2°F), pulse is 142/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 78/42 mm Hg. Examination shows a large, actively bleeding wound over the left thigh with exposed muscle tissue.  Peripheral pulses are weak, and capillary refill is delayed. There are no other signs of external bleeding. Two large-bore intravenous lines are placed, and initial laboratory studies are drawn. In addition to intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for hemodynamic support in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Vasopressors and inotropes are contraindicated as first-line therapy for hemorrhagic shock because they can worsen tissue perfusion and increase the risk of ischemic complications, and they do not address the primary problem of inadequate circulating volume. Hemorrhagic shock is characterized by profound hypovolemia leading to decreased preload and cardiac output. The most crucial intervention for hemorrhagic shock from acute trauma is immediate hemostatic control and rapid restoration of intravascular volume with transfusion of packed red blood cells and other blood components. Early transfusion improves outcomes and increases survival rates in trauma-related hemorrhagic shock.",

However, in hemorrhagic shock, vasoconstrictors can further decrease tissue perfusion and do not correct the underlying hypovolemia. Without volume resuscitation, norepinephrine may worsen organ ischemia and is therefore inappropriate as initial management in trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock.",

However, in hypovolemic shock, the primary problem is inadequate circulating volume rather than pump failure. Increasing contractility without restoring volume will not improve perfusion and may precipitate arrhythmias or worsen hypotension.",

This drug is indicated in anaphylactic shock and sometimes in cardiac arrest. In trauma-related hemorrhagic shock, epinephrine does not address the underlying hypovolemia. Although epinephrine can transiently elevate arterial pressure, the drug may exacerbate tissue ischemia by increasing systemic vascular resistance and myocardial oxygen consumption, without improving perfusion or oxygen delivery to vital organs.",

The OPO is responsible for evaluating medical suitability and discussing organ donation with the family. Physicians and hospital staff should not initiate the process for donation themselves (e.g., by obtaining consent), as this may result in conflicts of interest and reduce consent rates. OPO staff are specially trained to provide support, address questions, and facilitate the process ethically and sensitively. Early notification preserves organ viability and ensures that the process respects medical, ethical, and legal standards.",

He was intubated for airway protection and is admitted to the neurointensive care unit. Past medical history is unremarkable. His driver's license identifies him as an organ donor, and his name appears on the state donor registry. On hospital day 2, two attending physicians independently complete a brain death examination; pupils are fixed and nonreactive, corneal and gag reflexes are absent, and apnea tests confirm absence of respiratory drive. He is not receiving sedatives or paralytics, and he does not have hypothermia. He remains on mechanical ventilation with stable hemodynamics. The hospital has notified the regional organ procurement organization (OPO) per policy. The patient’s father states that the family’s religious beliefs prohibit organ donation and asks the team to “stop this process.” Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The patient's next-of-kin cannot override a valid first person authorization for any reason (e.g., religious beliefs). Clinicians should offer compassionate support and give clear information to the family but are otherwise obligated to follow the patient’s documented wishes.\n\nStandard protocol requires notifying an OPO as soon as a patient is near death with a severe neurological injury and again within 1 hour after brain death.
