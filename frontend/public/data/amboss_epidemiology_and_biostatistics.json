Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest.",

Because study B's 95% confidence interval of the HR excludes 1.0, this study had sufficient statistical power to detect a difference between the groups.

    "hint": "The abstract describes a randomized, controlled trial (RCT). Results from RCTs only apply to individuals with baseline and clinical characteristics similar to those of the population enrolled in the study and may not be generalizable to other populations. With this in mind, take a look at the relative risk and p-values in the table.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "The relative risk for the development of major depressive disorder among those in the afterschool programming group is 0.69, i.e., the investigated intervention produces a 31% risk reduction compared to the control treatment. The risk ratio for the development of ADHD among those in the afterschool programming group is 0.80, which means that the investigated intervention produces a 20% risk reduction compared to the control treatment. This indicates that afterschool programming has a greater effect on reducing the risk of depression (31%) than of ADHD (20%).",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Although at first glance it may appear that children who receive afterschool programming may have a decreased risk of developing bipolar disorder (with a relative risk of 0.64), this finding was not statistically significant because the p-value is 0.34 and the confidence interval includes 1.0. This suggests that the observed difference is likely due to random error.",

A relative risk >1 indicates increased risk, and a relative risk <1 indicates decreased risk in the intervention group compared to the control group. For example, in a clinical trial comparing a new treatment to a placebo, a relative risk of 0.80 for a particular outcome suggests that the risk of experiencing the outcome is 20% (1-0.80) lower in the treatment group compared to the group receiving the placebo.",

He conducts a study in 100 patients with a volume overloaded state confirmed by a Swan Ganz catheter in his hospital's cardiac critical care unit. He also recruits 100 patients with euvolemic state confirmed by Swan Ganz catheter. He subsequently examines all patients in the unit for rales and finds that 80 patients in the hypervolemic group have rales in comparison to 50 patients in the euvolemic group.

The specificity is calculated as TN/(TN + FP) or TN ÷ all patients without the condition. In this case: specificity = 50/(50 + 50) = 50/100 = 50%. Based on this study, there is a 50% chance for euvolemic patients to have rales on auscultation, making this test inappropriate to effectively exclude this condition in euvolemic patients. A test with such a low specificity causes high rates of false positives (e.g., rales due to pneumonia, ARDS).",

        "explanation_why": "The PPV is calculated as TP/(TP + FP) or TP ÷ all patients who tested positive. In this case PPV = 80/(80 + 50) = 80/130 ≈ 62%. Based on this study, the PPV suggests that if an individual in the study has rales on auscultation, the likelihood of that patient truly being in a hypervolemic state is approx. 62%.\n\nIt is important to note that PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) are posttest probabilities (PoTPs), which are dependent on the condition's prevalence (i.e., pretest probability). In order to calculate the true PoTPs, the condition's prevalence in the sample population must be identical to its value in the general population in consideration but this might not be feasible in all study designs. This study's PoTPs will not have external validity because the researcher selected 100 patients with hypervolemia and 100 with euvolemia for the sample population. In such a situation, the researcher can use test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity), which are independent of prevalence, and the true prevalence (obtained from medical literature) to calculate the true PoTPs.",

This study investigates the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. The exposure is the diabetic status of a patient as determined by fasting plasma glucose levels (binary variable: either with or without diabetes). The outcome is the onset of open-angle glaucoma. Association is evaluated using relative risk. Therefore, the null hypothesis for this study is that there is no significant difference in the risk of developing open-angle glaucoma in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.",

As a measure of the probability that observed results occurred by chance, p-values help determine the statistical significance of a relationship between two variables (e.g., a p-value of 0.05 indicates the probability of seeing the observed results by chance is 5%, assuming the null hypothesis is true). The magnitude of relative risk (not the p-value), however, is a measure of how strongly a risk factor is associated with a given outcome.",

    "correct_answer": "F",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "In the crude analysis, high cART adherence was associated with a decreased risk of developing DLBCL. After stratification of the data for CD4^+ cell counts at time of diagnosis, this association is only seen in patients with low CD4^+ cell counts, while the association can no longer be found in patients with high CD4^+ cell counts. Therefore, the impact of cART adherence appears to be affected by CD4^+ cell count.",

In this case, the association between the exposure (cART) and the outcome (DLBCL risk) is modified by a third variable (CD4 count). Consequently, stratification of the patients by CD4+ cell count reveals that the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is present for CD4^+ cell count < 200/mm^3 but not CD4^+  cell count > 200/mm^3. In other words, low CD4 count acts as an effect modifier, as it increases the risk of DLBCL in patients with poor cART adherence.\n\nEffect modification is often confused with confounding. These two concepts can be differentiated by performing a stratified analysis: when the population is stratified according to a factor that is thought to be a confounder or effect modifier, different results will be seen if it is a confounder (no significant difference between strata) or if it is an effect modifier (significant difference between the strata).",

Some of these patients had been scheduled to receive annual abdominal CTs while other patients had not been scheduled for such routine imaging surveillance. The medical student then identified a subgroup of patients who have developed recurrent metastatic disease despite their previous complete clinical response to chemotherapy and surgery. She compared patients who were diagnosed with metastatic cancer during routine follow-up imaging with patients who were diagnosed with metastatic cancer based on clinical symptoms at routine follow-up history and physical exams. She found that the average survival of patients who underwent routine imaging was four months longer than the survival of their peers who were diagnosed based on history and physical exam.

In other words, survival may appear longer if measured from the time of diagnosis to the time of death, even though it remains the same if measured from the time of disease onset to the time of death. Lead-time bias can be overcome by measuring the back-end survival, i.e., adjusting the survival according to the severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis.\n\nSee “Potential sources of bias in screening tests” table.",

        "explanation_why": "There is generally a longer period of time between disease onset and clinical manifestation in patients with slowly progressing disease compared to those with rapid disease progression. Therefore, the opportunity for detecting disease is greater in cases where the disease progress more slowly. Subsequently, a disproportionately high number of slowly progressing diseases are detected through screening, which is known as length-time bias. This may create a false impression that a screening test improves outcome or prognosis. A classic example is a cancer screening test that is assumed to improve survival rate but actually detects a higher number of asymptomatic, slow-growing tumors, i.e., the calculated survival rate is higher than the actual survival rate due to disproportionally more study participants with less aggressive disease.",

He was concerned that his patients had developed agranulocytosis, a relatively rare but dangerous adverse event associated with clozapine. When the psychiatrist checked the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of both patients, one was 450/mm^3, while the other was 700/mm^3 (N = 1500/mm^3). According to the clozapine REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program, severe neutropenia in clozapine recipients has often been defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/mm^3.

For this test, raising the cutoff value to 750/mm^3 broadens the inclusion criteria for agranulocytosis, increasing the rate of true and false positives while decreasing the rate of true and false negatives. Broadening the inclusion criteria in this test also increases sensitivity and decreases specificity. In addition, broadening inclusion criteria in a low cutoff value test decreases the test's positive predictive value while increasing its negative predictive value.\n\nBe aware: In tests for which a high cutoff value is diagnostic, raising the cutoff value increases specificity and decreases sensitivity. By contrast, in agranulocytosis, a low cutoff value is diagnostic; therefore, raising the cutoff has the opposite effect.",

The study compared patients who had PTSD with those who did not have PTSD in order to determine if PTSD is associated with worse asthma control. During a follow-up period of 12 months, the researchers found that patients with PTSD had a greater number of hospitalizations for asthma exacerbations (RR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.4–2.5) after adjusting for medical comorbidities, psychiatric comorbidities other than PTSD, and sociodemographic variables. Results are shown:\n\n≥ 1 asthma exacerbation\nNo asthma exacerbations\n\nPTSD\n80\n80\n\nNo PTSD\n50\n150\n\nBased on these results, what proportion of asthma hospitalizations in patients with PTSD could be attributed to PTSD?",

The RR can be calculated by dividing the incidence of asthma exacerbations in PTSD patients by the incidence of asthma exacerbations in patients without PTSD: (80/160)/(50/200) = 0.5/0.25 = 2. A relative risk > 1.0 indicates a positive association and increased likelihood of asthma exacerbations in patients with PTSD. However, the RR does not measure the magnitude of the excess risk attributable to PTSD. To estimate the proportion of asthma hospitalizations attributable to PTSD in patients with PTSD, the ARP needs to be calculated.",

To determine the attributable risk here, the incidence of asthma exacerbations in patients with PTSD is subtracted from the incidence of asthma exacerbations in patients without PTSD.

Increased amounts of exposure (in this case, prior episodes of DKA) leading to an increased risk of the outcome (in this case, readmission) is one of the criteria required to establish causality in epidemiological studies. Dose-response relationships are quite common in the epidemiologic literature. Other examples include the relationship between the amount of tobacco smoked and mortality from lung cancer, an incremental increases in blood pressure or left ventricle hypertrophy correlating with increased myocardial infarction risk, and an incremental increases in clozapine doses correlating with increased risk of seizures in patients with schizophrenia.",

During chart review, it is found that a history of cesarean birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk (RR) of placenta accreta for patients with a history of cesarean birth is 1.23, with a P value of 0.03 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.12–1.46. In the context of this study, which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the observed association between cesarean birth and placenta accreta?",

During chart review, it is found that a history of cesarean birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk (RR) of placenta accreta for patients with a history of cesarean birth is 1.23, with a P value of 0.03 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.12–1.46. In the context of this study, which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the observed association between cesarean birth and placenta accreta?",

        "explanation_why": "A CI is a range of values in which the true population parameter is likely to lie, based on the sample data. In this study, the 95% CI for the RR of placenta accreta in patients with a history of cesarean birth is 1.12–1.46. In other words, with repeated sampling, 95% of calculated CIs would contain the true RR. The Cl is determined by the alpha value, which is typically set at 5%, using the following formula: 100% - alpha = Cl. The CI does not guarantee that the true RR has a 95% probability of lying within a given observed interval but rather reflects the reliability of the estimation process. The reported interval of 1.12–1.46 indicates a statistically significant association between a history of cesarean birth and increased risk of placenta accreta because the CI does not contain the null value (i.e., RR = 1.0). Reporting both the point estimate (RR = 1.23) and the CI allows for assessment of the strength and precision of the observed association; a narrower interval indicates greater precision.",

        "explanation_why": "The P value is the probability that the result of a given statistical test will be at least as extreme as the result actually observed on repeat testing, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Accordingly, the P value of 0.03 in this study signifies that there is a 3% probability that the observed sample RR will be at least as extreme as 1.23, assuming that a prior cesarean birth does not increase the risk of placenta accreta. In this case, if there were no association between prior cesarean birth and placenta accreta (i.e., RR = 1.0) and the study was repeated 100 times, a relative risk of ≥ 1.23 would only be found 3 times (i.e., 3% of the repeated studies). However, this does not mean that there is a 3% probability that the observed RR is due to chance. The P value quantifies the probability of the data given the null hypothesis rather than the probability of the hypothesis given the data.",

The variability originates from the sample data and the calculated CI, not from the parameter itself. For this study, it is incorrect to say there is a 95% probability that the true RR is higher than 1.12, because the true RR is a fixed parameter that either does or does not fall within this specific calculated interval.",

The comparison to a control group without anti-NMDA encephalitis helps determine the presence of risk factors that might be associated with the disease. To assess the strength of association between a risk factor and disease, the odds ratio is reported. Unlike cohort studies, case-control studies identify patients with or without the suspected outcome first (here: anti-NMDA encephalitis) and then evaluate the prevalence of the risk factor (here: ovarian teratomas) in each group retrospectively.\n\nOn a side note, case-control studies have actually found a strong association between the occurrence of ovarian teratomas in young women and anti-NMDA encephalitis. Encephalitis is considered a paraneoplastic syndrome in these patients.",

Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest.",

This researcher has already determined the outcome (i.e., anti-NMDA encephalitis) and now wants to see what risk factors are associated with it. Furthermore, while a rare disease as this subtype of anti-NMDA encephalitis could theoretically be studied in a retrospective cohort study, its low incidence would make it time-consuming and impractical to find a group of patients with ovarian teratomas and determine via chart review how many of these eventually developed anti-NMDA encephalitis.",

Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest.",

The investigators examined the correlation between income and rates of syphilis in neighborhoods of New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. Data on the annual number of notified syphilis cases in a neighborhood and the number of individuals in a neighborhood who are beneficiaries of welfare programs during the same time were provided by each city's health agency. Data on each neighborhood's total population for the same time could not be obtained and approximations from the last census were used. This study is best described as which of the following?",

Individuals are then assessed retrospectively to see if they have or have not developed a certain disease or outcome. Retrospective cohort studies are time-saving and relatively inexpensive, as they involve the analysis of data that has already been collected. Cohort studies are well suited to determining the incidence of a disease and allow for the relative risk (RR) of developing a disease of interest to be calculated. Here, the RR of developing syphilis is 1.3 in active cocaine users compared to patients without this risk factor.\n\nSee “Types of cohort studies” table.",

Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population.

    "question_text": "The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a commonly used nine-question diagnostic test for major depression. A medical student is collecting data on the test's sensitivity and specificity to validate the PHQ-9 questionnaire for his summer project. The student plots the data, forming the green line in the figure. A total score of 20 out of 27 on the PHQ-9 questionnaire, which is generally used as a cutoff for a high likelihood of severe depression, is represented by point A on the graph. If the PHQ-9 questionnaire were administered in such a way that a score of 15 out of 27 was diagnostic instead, which of the points on the graph would most accurately represent the new PHQ-9 cutoff?",
    "content_preview": "The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a commonly used nine-question diagnostic test for major depression. A medical student is collecting data on the test's sensitivity and specificity to validate the PHQ-9 questionnaire for his summer project. The student plots the data, forming the green line in the figure. A total score of 20 out of 27 on the PHQ-9 questionnaire, which is generally used as a cutoff for a high likelihood of severe depression, is represented by point A on the graph. If the PHQ-9 questionnaire were administered in such a way that a score of 15 out of 27 was diagnostic instead, which of the points on the graph would most accurately represent the new PHQ-9 cutoff?",

In ROC curves, the y-axis represents the sensitivity (true positive rate) and the x-axis corresponds to 1 - specificity (false positive rate). By lowering the cutoff from 20 to 15 out of 27 points, more people will be diagnosed as severely depressed. Thus, the sensitivity of the PHQ-9 test slightly increases (more true positives). At the same time, however, the specificity will decrease (more false positives).\n\nIdeally, the cutoff point is on a curve in the upper left corner, where sensitivity and specificity are 100% (the highest rate of true positives together with the lowest rate of false positives).",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "In a standard contingency table, the odds ratio is calculated as OR = (a/c)/(b/d) = (a/b)/(c/d), while the relative risk is calculated as RR = (a/(a + b))/(c/(c + d)). Normally, RR cannot be calculated from case-control studies. However, when the values representing the diseased population, a and c, become insignificant compared to the values representing the nondiseased population, b and d, RR approximates the OR: RR ≈ (a/b)/(c/d).",

        "explanation_why": "The rare disease assumption is the most important prerequisite that allows for this surgeon's conclusion. This concept assumes that if the incidence of a study's outcome (in this case, hypertensive crisis during pheochromocytoma resection) is low (i.e., the disease is rare), the odds ratio approximates the relative risk. Usually, the relative risk cannot be established in case-control studies because subjects are not tracked over time. Instead, the odds ratio is calculated to determine whether there is an association between an exposure and outcome (in this case, MEN 2 syndrome and intraoperative hypertension, respectively), although the OR does not provide a quantitative estimate of the risk. Because intraoperative hypertension during pheochromocytoma resection is rare, the rare disease assumption holds that OR is approximately equal to RR. It can thus be assumed that the risk of intraoperative hypertension during pheochromocytoma removal is 3.4 times greater in patients with MEN 2 syndromes than in patients without MEN 2 syndromes.",

They decide to implement a free patient navigation program to encourage more individuals to obtain colonoscopies in accordance with US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines. Individuals were recruited at a community center and randomly assigned into two groups. The first group was enrolled in a patient navigation program and attended monthly meetings, where they were given regular reminders that their adherence to screening guidelines was being evaluated. The second group did not participate in the patient navigation program. Colonoscopy rates were assessed via chart review and showed that 90% of participants in the first group and 34% of people in the second group adhered to screening guidelines. Which of the following most likely contributed to the observed disparity in colonoscopy screening rates?",

If this study's researchers did not consider the role of the Hawthorne effect, they could have overestimated the success of the patient navigation program. Although there are methods for reducing the Hawthorne effect, such as withholding the aim of a study from its subjects and/or concealing the fact that they are being monitored, these strategies are not considered ethical. Conducting a study over a prolonged period of time can make subjects accustomed to being studied and is therefore an ethical strategy for reducing the Hawthorne effect.\n\nHigh degrees of random errors, biases (e.g., Hawthorne effect), and confounding variables can limit the validity (i.e., accuracy) of a study.",

Severe hyponatremia, often defined as < 120 mEq/L, is associated with altered mental status, coma, and seizures, and warrants treatment with hypertonic saline. Because some patients are chronically hyponatremic, with serum levels < 120 mEq/L, but remain asymptomatic, the physician is considering decreasing the cutoff value for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L. Changing the cutoff value to < 115 mEq/L would affect the validity of serum sodium in predicting severe hyponatremia in which of the following ways?",

    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "Remember that this is a test in which a low cutoff value is diagnostic. Lowering the cutoff value to < 115 mEq/L narrows the inclusion criteria, resulting in fewer positive results (i.e., diagnoses of severe hyponatremia).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Be aware: The effect of lowering a cutoff value depends on whether the test has a high or low original cutoff. In diagnostic tests with a high cutoff value (e.g., CA 125 for ovarian cancer, lipase for pancreatitis), lowering the cutoff broadens the inclusion criteria and therefore increases sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) while decreasing specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). In diagnostic tests with a low cutoff value, lowering the cutoff has the opposite effect, decreasing sensitivity and NPV while increasing specificity and PPV.\n\nBecause this test for severe hyponatremia already has a low cutoff value, lowering the cutoff further narrows the inclusion criteria and decreases the number of positive results while increasing the number of negative results. Lowering the cutoff therefore decreases the false positives (FP) and true positives (TP) and increases the true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN).\n\nSpecificity = TN/(TN + FP). Because TN increase and FP decrease, the numerator increases by more than the denominator, and the result (value of the fraction) increases. Therefore, lowering the cutoff value in a test that already has a low cutoff increases specificity, making it more likely that a patient without the condition correctly gets a negative test result. This leads to a tradeoff in the test's sensitivity. Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN). Because TP decrease and FN increase, the numerator decreases by more than the denominator, and the result decreases. Therefore, lowering the cutoff value in this test decreases sensitivity, making it less likely that a patient with the condition correctly gets a positive test result.\n\nNPV = TN/(TN + FN). Because both TN and FN increase, the numerator increases by less than the denominator, and the result decreases. Therefore, lowering the cutoff value in this test decreases NPV, making it less likely that a patient with a negative test does not have the condition. PPV = TP/(TP + FP). Because both TP and FP decrease, the numerator decreases by less than the denominator, and the result increases. Therefore, lowering the cutoff value in this test increases PPV, making it more likely that a patient with a positive test has the condition.",

A PhD student in the research group evaluates the performance of the test depending on different cutoff values of the serum protein. All patients in the study population are > 50 years of age, and each has a history of smoking of at least 30 pack years. The researcher plots the new test's sensitivity and specificity data on a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The test has the best performance in identifying lung cancer in patients with a serum protein cutoff value of > 50 U/mL, for which the sensitivity of the test is 93% and the specificity is 88%. A fellow PhD research student decides to repeat the study using the same screening test with the same cutoff value in patients aged < 50 years without a history of smoking. In this patient group, significantly fewer patients have lung cancer. Which of the points on the graph best represents the performance of the test in this patient group?",

Because the prevalence of a disease does not affect the sensitivity or specificity of a test, and the cutoff value remains unchanged (i.e., > 50 U/mL), the point on the ROC curve depicting the sensitivity and specificity of the test also remains unchanged (i.e., point B with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.88, or 1 - specificity of 0.12).",

Increased power also leads to a lower likelihood of falsely accepting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (type II error).\n\nMost studies aim to achieve 80% statistical power (by convention). Power depends mainly on the magnitude of the association (if there is one) and the size of the sample population. If the researchers have an idea of how strong the magnitude of the association is, they can use power calculations to estimate how big a sample population they would need in order to achieve 80% power.",

She recently had sexual intercourse for the first time and had used a condom with her long-term boyfriend. She has no history of serious illness or sexually transmitted infections. However, the patient is still worried about the possibility she has HIV despite the negative HIV test. She states that the package insert of the HIV test shows that of 100 patients who are found to be HIV-positive on PCR, 91 tested positive via the HIV test. Later in the day, a 23-year-old woman with a history of genitourinary chlamydia infection also comes to the urgent care center after testing negative for HIV. She states that she recently had unprotected intercourse with “someone who might have HIV.” If the test is conducted on the 23-year-old patient, how will its performance compare to the test conducted on the 17-year-old patient?",

        "explanation_why": "High sensitivity is the most important characteristic for a screening test. The priority of a screening test is to detect as many affected patients as possible. The risk of a false positive result (which is related to specificity) is, therefore, less important than minimizing the number of false negatives. In a test with high sensitivity, a negative test result helps to rule out disease. High specificity, on the other hand, is the most important characteristic for a confirmatory test.\n\nSensitivity and specificity, which are test characteristics, are independent of prevalence in the general population (pretest probability). A high sensitivity correlates with a high negative predictive value (NPV) and a high specificity correlates with a high positive predictive value (PPV). However, NPV and PPV, which are posttest probabilities, are also dependent on the condition's prevalence. If the prevalence of a condition in the general population is not represented in the sample population, the NPV and PPV calculated for the sample population do not have external validity.",

    "question_text": "A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for treatment of aortic stenosis in adults 65 years of age and older. Three hundred patients who received TAVR and another 300 patients who received SAVR were followed for 5 years and monitored for cardiovascular symptoms and all-cause mortality. The study found that patients who received TAVR had a higher risk of death at the end of a 5-year follow-up period (HR = 1.21, p < 0.001). Later, the researchers performed a subgroup analysis by adjusting their data for ejection fraction. After the researchers compared risk of death between the TAVR and SAVR groups among patients of the same ejection fraction, they found that TAVR was no longer associated with a higher risk of death. They concluded that ejection fraction was a potential confounding variable. Which of the following statements would be most supportive of this conclusion?",

The study found that patients who received TAVR had a higher risk of death at the end of a 5-year follow-up period (HR = 1.21, p &lt; 0.001). Later, the researchers performed a subgroup analysis by adjusting their data for ejection fraction. After the researchers compared risk of death between the TAVR and SAVR groups among patients of the same ejection fraction, they found that TAVR was no longer associated with a higher risk of death. They concluded that ejection fraction was a potential confounding variable. Which of the following statements would be most supportive of this conclusion?",

At a departmental grand rounds she recently attended, one of the presenters claimed that smokers are only at increased risk for Barrett esophagus in the presence of acid reflux. She decides to design a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between smoking and Barrett esophagus. After comparing 400 smokers to 400 non-smokers identified via chart review, she finds that smokers were at increased risk of Barrett esophagus at the end of a 10-year follow-up period (RR = 1.82, p < 0.001). Among patients with a history of acid reflux, there was no relationship between smoking and Barrett esophagus (p = 0.52). Likewise, no relationship was found between smoking and Barrett esophagus among patients without a history of acid reflux (p = 0.48).

If a statistically significant relationship existed between smoking and Barrett esophagus in patients with acid reflux, but the relationship did not hold in patients without acid reflux, this would be an example of effect modification. Instead, the relationship between smoking and Barrett esophagus is no longer statistically significant after adjusting for acid reflux.",

The correlation between smoking and Barrett esophagus is no longer statistically significant after stratification (controlling for acid reflux). Acid reflux is a confounder because it affects both the dependent variable/outcome (Barrett esophagus) and independent variable/exposure to a risk factor (smoking). Rather than a true association existing between smoking and Barrett esophagus, the results of this study suggest that the increased prevalence of acid reflux among smokers may explain the apparent association between smoking and Barrett esophagus in the unadjusted analysis. To minimize confounding during study design, stratification, randomization, and/or matching can be used. Good study design includes anticipating potential confounders.",

He has no involuntary leakage of urine and no history of serious illness. He takes no medication. His younger brother was diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 35 years. Rectal examination shows a smooth, symmetrical prostate without nodules. The remainder of the examination and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Bladder ultrasonography discloses a postvoid residual volume of 10 mL (N < 50). The physician offers to discuss the advantages and limitations of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in screening for prostate cancer. He mentions that a serum PSA of 4 ng/mL is generally used as a cutoff value. At this cutoff, the test has a sensitivity of 21% for detecting any prostate cancer and 51% for detecting high-risk prostate cancer, with a specificity of 91%. In patients without urinary retention, hematuria, back pain, or incontinence, the positive predictive value (PPV) for PSA > 4 ng/mL is estimated at 30%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) for PSA ≤ 4 ng/mL at 85%. Based on this information, what is the probability that this patient does not have prostate cancer if his PSA is 4.3 ng/mL?",

Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",

By matching cases and controls based on potential confounders, this technique may help detect exposures (history of feeding problems, history of URI) that are relevant to the outcome of interest (BRUE). Matching does not completely eliminate confounding and may in fact introduce confounding if the investigators match by factors that are not matched in the source population. Matching may also introduce a bias by rendering the controls and the cases more similar to each other not only with regard to the factor the investigators seek to match but also for the exposure under investigation.",

The clinic serves largely uninsured low-income patients in a New York City neighborhood with a large African American and Latino population. Two weeks ago, the patient was treated in the local emergency department where she presented with an altered mental state and dysuria. The medical student had recently read about a study that described a strong relationship between cognitive impairment and UTI hospitalization risk (RR = 1.34, p < 0.001). The attending physician at the medical student's free clinic is also familiar with this study and tells the medical student that the study was conducted in a sample of upper-middle-class Caucasian patients in the Netherlands. The attending states that the results of the study should be interpreted with caution. Which of the following concerns is most likely underlying the attending physician's remarks?",

Alternatively, total person-time observation = (number of people observed) × (mean followup period).\n\nThe IR in study A is (30 cases)/(3000 persons × 10 years) = 1 case per 1000 person-years. The IR in study B is (9 cases)/(300 persons × 30 years) = 1 case per 1000 person-years. The IRs in both studies are the same and the risk is therefore equivalent.\n\nAbsolute risk (AR), which is the likelihood of an event occurring under specific conditions, is equivalent to cumulative incidence or incidence proportion (IP).

        "explanation_why": "Precision is the reproducibility of a study's results on the same sample under comparable conditions. Pooling the sample population of individual studies into one larger sample population increases precision by decreasing random error, the values of certain measures of dispersion (e.g., standard deviation) associated with the measured outcomes, and the confidence intervals of the effect size.",

This is a predetermined parameter. Pooling studies together into a new study can change the type 1 error probability, i.e., alpha value, for the new study (it can increase or decrease it depending on the type of studies pooled together and the meta-analysis methodology) but does not affect the new study's alpha criterion.",

A total of 125 participants with autism and mean age of 12 years were recruited for the study and took part in weekly social skills training sessions for 3 months. Participants were recruited from support groups in a large US city for parents with autistic children. Parents in the support group were very eager to volunteer for the study, and over 300 children were placed on a waiting list while the study was conducted. At baseline and at the end of the 3-month period, participants were observed during a videotaped social play exercise and scored on a social interaction rating scale by their parents. Social interaction rating scores following the 3-month intervention were more than twice as high as baseline scores (p < 0.001). During exit interviews, one parent commented, \"I knew from the start that this program was going to be life-changing for my son!\" This sentiment was echoed by a number of other parents. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the study's result?",

The quote, “I knew from the start that this program was going to be life-changing for my son” suggests cognitive bias. The expectation that social interactions would improve after the social skills training sessions may have unconsciously led to higher ratings of social behavior, thus contributing to the two-fold increase in social interaction scores. The high demand for the social skills training program among the parents, culminating in the waiting list, may also indicate a potential cognitive bias in many of the parents of the participants.",

In this scenario, 50% of patients received surgery, and 50% followed a nonsurgical weight loss program. Still, the variable is categorical because it reflects group membership rather than a continuous measure. The percentage of weight loss at the end of the study, on the other hand, is a continuous variable.

An epidemiologist is working to identify possible reasons for this. After analyzing a series of nationwide health surveillance databases, the epidemiologist finds that the incidence of PBC has remained stable over the past 20 years. Which of the following is the most plausible explanation for the increased prevalence of PBC?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The increased prevalence of PBC is unlikely to be attributable to increased incidence of PBC, given the stable number of new PBC cases over the past 20 years. More people are being documented as having PBC, while the number of new cases has remained the same.",

        "explanation_why": "In a stable population, the prevalence is approximated as the incidence multiplied by the average duration of the disease. An increased prevalence of disease with a stable incidence can be explained by an increase in the average duration of the disease. This occurs as a result of factors such as an improvement in the quality of care of patients with a disease, which decreases mortality from the disease and increases the duration for which people survive with the disease.",

Water entering the tub represents incident cases (new cases of disease). The proportion of the tub that is filled with water (prevalence of disease) is affected by both the amount of water entering the tub (incidence) and the amount of water leaving the tub (when people no longer have the disease because they died or because they recovered).",

        "explanation_why": "The odds of a patient with unprovoked seizure having a history of major depressive disorder (i.e., exposure odds) is the ratio of the number of patients with MDD who develop an unprovoked seizure (a = 20) to the number of patients without MDD who developed an unprovoked seizure (c = 16). Similarly, the odds of patients without seizures having a history of MDD is 35  (= b) divided by 70 (= d). The odds ratio of exposure is calculated as: (a/c) / (b/d) = ad/bc = (20*70)/(35*16) = 2.5. Based on this study, the odds of a patient with an unprovoked seizure having a history of MDD is 2.5 times higher when compared to patients without seizures.\n\nThe odds of an unprovoked seizure in a patient with MDD, i.e., event odds (disease odds), is the ratio of the number of patients with MDD who develop an unprovoked seizure (a = 20) to the number of patients with MDD who did not develop an unprovoked seizure (b = 35). Similarly, the odds of a seizure in a patient without MDD is 16 (= c) divided by 70 (= d). Consequently, the odds ratio of disease is calculated as: (a/b) / (c/d) = ad/bc = (20*70)/(35*16) = 2.5. As one can see, the odds ratio of disease and the odds ratio of exposure have the same value and are often used interchangeably in practice.",

        "explanation_why": "[20/(20 +35)] - [16/(16 +70)] = 0.17 would represent the difference between the risks of unprovoked seizures of patients with MDD and without MDD (attributable risk) if this was a cohort study. However, since case-control studies only sample a subset of all possible disease-free people as controls, the actual incidence of disease and, therefore, also the attributable risk cannot usually be calculated. The appropriate way to compare odds, which should be used instead of risks in a case-control study, is through a ratio (division) rather than a difference (subtraction).",

    "hint": "To answer this question correctly, first calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) (i.e., the number of individuals that must be treated for one person to benefit from treatment), which is the inverse of absolute risk reduction (1/ARR). Then, as the second step, consider that the question asks for the number of persons who would benefit if 200 patients were treated!",

The relative risk reduction, RRR = 1 - RR, thus equals 1 - 0.6 = 0.4, which indicates a 40% reduction in the risk of hip fracture due to the pharmacologic therapy compared to control.\n\nDrug advertisements often use measures of relative risk because they tend to overestimate the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention. In the case of this new bisphosphonate analog, the drug company is likely to promote the 40% reduction in relative risk rather than the 2% reduction in absolute risk.",

Both procedures were conducted so that patients experienced the same sensations while receiving treatment. After 2 weeks of treatment and neuropsychiatric testing to assess recognition memory and 1 week of observation during which no treatments were delivered, the treatment in each group was changed to the one used in the other group.

In the study described in this vignette, all the participants sequentially received tDCS and sham tDCS (i.e., the groups crossed over). A washout period between treatments is commonly included in crossover studies to enable any effects of the first treatment to wear off prior to starting the sequential treatment. Crossover designs are best suited to study interventions with a temporary effect for chronic diseases with a stable state during the study period. They are not suitable for studying acute conditions or interventions with a permanent or long carry-over effect (e.g., vaccinations, surgery).\n\nWhen compared to other RCT variants, the advantages of a crossover study design include a low risk of confounding bias, high recruitment rates (because each participant knows that they will be in the nonplacebo arm at some point), and increased statistical power (due to doubling of the sample size with the same number of participants). The disadvantages include a long study period (due to the crossover phase and the need for a washout period) and the resulting increase in the dropout rate.",

At the conclusion of the study, the investigators found that patients who underwent combined therapy lost a mean of 8.2 kg (18.1 lb), whereas patients counseled on lifestyle modification alone lost a mean of 4.3 kg (9.5 lb) (p < 0.001).

This apparent benefit results from a higher detection rate of disease (rather than a true delay of death) that is longer in duration but lower in severity. Patients with aggressive forms of a disease develop the disease and die within a timespan that is shorter than the screening interval and may never be screened.

An observation period of 8 years is unlikely to be long enough to observe a statistically significant difference in rates of mesothelioma between those exposed and those not exposed to asbestos. Malignancies and other chronic diseases typically have very long latency periods. It can therefore take years to study disease pathogenesis and the influence of factors that may modify the risk (e.g., a new treatment). Infectious diseases, on the other hand, have a very short latent period (incubation period).",

        "explanation_why": "1.4 is the positive likelihood ratio (LR^+) of the clinical presentation that suggests active TB in this scenario. Positive likelihood ratio is the likelihood that an individual with a given condition will have a positive prediction (e.g., positive screening test or clinical presentation suggesting the condition) compared to the likelihood that an individual without the condition will have a positive prediction. LR^+ is the true positive rate (TP rate) divided by the false positive rate (FP rate). This formula is expressed as LR^+   = (TP rate)/(FP rate) = sensitivity/(1 - specificity). LR^+ = 0.70 /(1 - 0.50) → 0.70/0.50 = 1.4.",

PPV is calculated by dividing the number of true positives (TP) by the total number of positives, which includes both true and false positives (FP). This formula is expressed as PPV = TP/(TP + FP).\n\nIn this scenario, TP = 700 and FP = 2100. Therefore, PPV = 700/(700 + 2100) → 700/2800 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nPPV increases as the prevalence of a disease increases in a population.",

All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys.

Therefore, its +LR is 6 or 0.66/(1 - 0.89)= 0.66/0.11. A +LR of 6 for this test means that there is a 6-fold increase in the odds of renal cell carcinoma in a patient with a positive test result.

    "hint": "Prevalence is calculated by dividing the number of individuals with fasting hyperglycemia by the total population: 500/2500 = 0.2.

Inserting the values for P and T into the formula results in 0.2/(1 - 0.2) = IR x 25; solving for IR results in 0.01. The best estimate of the number of individuals who will develop fasting hyperglycemia in one year is IR × population at risk or 0.01 × (2500 - 500) = 20.",

            "description": "This image of a bathtub filling with water with a leak metaphorically represents the relationship of incidence, prevalence, and mortality (or recovery). Water entering the tub represents incident cases (new cases of disease). The proportion of the tub that is filled with water (prevalence of disease) is affected by both the amount of water entering the tub (incidence) and the amount of water leaving the tub (when people no longer have the disease because they died or because they recovered).",

This strategy is commonly used in experimental studies to decrease the likelihood of bias. Blinding can also be used in observational studies; by blinding outcome analysts, observer bias can be avoided, improving the study's validity. However, data analysis has already been performed for this study. While it would be possible to reanalyze the raw data with a blinded analyst, it would be time-consuming and would not address other factors that influence validity, such as confounding variables.

Crossover designs can help mitigate the effect of confounders in participant selection. However, additional analysis cannot convert the described prospective cohort study into a crossover study, which is an entirely different study design. Furthermore, a crossover design would not be appropriate to assess the relationship between childhood diet and cardiovascular disease in adulthood because this relationship does not involve any intervention and the observation period of 20 years would be impractical for this study design.",

For example, in this study, higher socioeconomic status may be associated with higher vegetable consumption and therefore a lower risk of hyperlipidemia and greater exercise tolerance. The effect of confounding can be reduced by stratifying participants by their socioeconomic status. Certain stratification approaches (e.g., matching) can also be used during the design phase of a study: In epidemiology, matching involves balancing the baseline characteristics of the study participants to mitigate confounding variables.\n\nAn alternative method that can be used in the data analysis phase to control for potential confounders is multiple regression analysis.",

Randomization, a central component of clinical trials, ensures that the sample group is representative of the population being studied and can control for both known and unknown confounders. This strategy is used in randomized controlled trials, however, randomization cannot be used in observational studies (e.g., cohort studies) because these studies do not involve any intervention.",

Correlation does not imply causation! It merely shows whether a linear relationship exists between the two variables and how strong it is.\n\nThe r coefficient is a measure of the strength and directionality of a linear relationship between two variables.

The width of the confidence interval is an indicator of the uncertainty in the estimator statistic (in this case, the mean IQ). Smaller study populations are more subject to the effects of chance, leading to less precision in the estimate of the mean which manifests as a wider confidence interval. In contrast, increasing the sample size will mitigate the effects of chance, providing a more precise estimate of the true mean that manifests as a narrower confidence interval (decreased range).",

It is dependent on the variability (i.e., standard deviation) of the measured values (in this case, IQ scores) and the sample size (SEM = SD/√n). By increasing the sample size, the sample means approach the true population mean, resulting in a smaller SEM. In contrast, a greater standard deviation and/or a smaller sample size will increase the SEM, resulting in a less accurate estimate. The SEM is commonly used to calculate confidence intervals that indicate, with a given level of confidence, the range of values within which the true mean of the underlying population falls.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the standard deviation and the SEM. The standard deviation is a measure of the variability of a sample, whereas the SEM is a measure of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean.",

A simple example would be trying to estimate the mean body weight of a population using an incorrectly calibrated scale (e.g., one that consistently shows a weight 3 lb less than the true weight). A change in sample size would not predispose to this type of error. Random error, on the other hand, is inherent in any sample statistic that estimates a true population parameter.

All volunteers are monitored for the duration of the study and their serum potassium concentration is measured each week. No statistically significant difference in mean serum potassium concentrations is found between the volunteers who consumed licorice regularly and those avoiding licorice. The serum potassium concentrations remained within the range of 3.5–5.0 mEq/L in all volunteers from both groups.

Another group of similar patients with no history of type 2 diabetes mellitus or pancreatic cancer is also identified. The investigators examine the medical charts to determine whether the group of patients who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus was more likely to have developed pancreatic cancer over the 10-year period. The investigators ultimately found that the risk of developing pancreatic cancer was 25% higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to patients without this condition.

Cohort studies are well suited to determining the incidence of a disease and allow for the relative risk (RR) of developing a disease of interest to be calculated. Here, the RR of developing pancreatic cancer is 1.25 in patients with a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus compared to patients without this risk factor. Retrospective cohort studies are time-saving and relatively inexpensive when compared to prospective cohort studies because they involve the analysis of data that has already been collected.",

            "description": "Cross-sectional studies (prevalence studies, snapshot studies) are used to determine the prevalence of exposure (e.g., a risk factor) and outcome (e.g., disease) at a specific point in time.Case-control studies are used to determine whether an exposure that happened in the past is associated with a present outcome. Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest.",

It was found that patients taking the combination regimen (n = 200) had a lower seizure frequency compared to patients taking the standard treatment alone (n = 200; p < 0.01). However, several participants taking the novel drug reported severe drowsiness. The investigators administered a survey to both the combination treatment group and standard treatment group to evaluate whether the drowsiness interfered with daily functioning using a yes or no questionnaire.

Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest.",

Three-hundred eligible patients with SMM are randomized to receive 6 cycles of either pomalidomide or a placebo. At the 24-month follow-up, the investigators find that a significant number of patients were not adherent with the treatment assigned or lost to follow-up. Nonetheless, results for the patients who completed the protocol showed that pomalidomide improves progression-free survival. The investigators are worried about potential biases resulting from the significant loss to follow-up and nonadherence in the treatment group.

Study groups are divided into subgroups according to the third variable and measures of association can be calculated for each subgroup. A subgroup analysis adjusts for an effect modifier or a confounder. In the described study, this method can improve the estimate of the real effect of pomalidomide on patients with SMM.

Noninferiority trials are most commonly used when placebo control would be unethical. The described study is an unblinded, randomized controlled trial with a treatment group and a placebo group. By definition, noninferiority trials do not compare treatment to placebo, but rather to control treatment. Furthermore, noninferiority is a study design and not a method of statistical analysis, so it cannot be applied in hindsight.

        "explanation_why": "An intention-to-treat analysis is a statistical method in which the data of every patient enrolled in a study is used for data analysis (including data from drop-out patients), and in which each patient is analyzed as part of the treatment group that they were randomly assigned to at the beginning of the study (regardless of the treatment they eventually receive). This analysis includes data from all patients and preserves the original randomization, giving a more accurate estimate of the efficacy of the tested treatment and minimizing selection bias when compared to data analysis that excludes drop-out patients. In the described study, the large drop-out rate as a result of nonadherence and loss to follow-up may have created selection bias and the shown improvement of progression-free survival under pomalidomide may be falsely skewed in favor of the treatment. An intention-to-treat analysis is an appropriate technique to address this bias.\n\nThe converse of intention-to-treat analysis is per-protocol analysis.",

        "explanation_why": "A per-protocol analysis is a statistical method in which the study groups are compared using data only from the patients who finished the treatment that they were originally assigned. This analysis is used to evaluate the treatment effect under optimal conditions. Using a per-protocol analysis in the described study improves the estimate of the real effect of pomalidomide on patients with SMM. However, this method tends to overestimate the effects of the tested treatment because it does not take into account when patients drop out of the study. Furthermore, this technique does not minimize selection bias because the original randomization is lost with this method.",

        "explanation_why": "A study's accuracy (validity) depends on systematic errors and bias. The two forms of validity are internal and external. Internal validity is likely unaffected by the blood pressure measurement, as both studies use calibrated sphygmomanometers from the same manufacturer. External validity refers to how applicable the study is to the general population; study B is more likely to exhibit higher external validity compared to study A, which involves Berkson bias. In study A, the actual prevalence of hypertension in the general population is less likely to be accurately reflected due to this bias. Therefore, study B is expected to have higher accuracy.",

When reliability is high, the data points are more close together.Validity refers to how close the data points are to the true value: when validity is low, the data points do not approximate the true value.",

Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest.",

The virus seems to be infecting teenagers more often than adults. There is evidence that the virus provides long-term immunity after the infection has cleared. Prior to the investigation, 150 residents had developed the disease, 100 of whom were teenagers. During the 6 months of the study, another 400 residents were diagnosed with the disease, 350 of whom are teenagers. Which of the following is the incidence of the new disease for the given time period in this town?",

If the question had asked for the 6-month incidence in teenagers, the total number of teenagers in the town (X) would be needed to calculate the number at risk of developing the disease during the study.

Since β is inversely related to statistical power (1 - β), the higher the β, the lower the statistical power. To increase the statistical power, investigators must decrease β by increasing the sample size in the study and/or making more precise measurements of the outcome of interest.\n\nWith pilot studies, low statistical power on post hoc power analysis is a common occurrence. Pilot studies are conducted when the effect size cannot be reliably estimated (e.g., from literature). When designing a pilot study, the power is fixed a priori (usually at a value ≥ 0.80). The study is then performed using a small number of participants (usually 10–50; the exact number depends on the type of study and type of statistical analysis) and the minimum detectable effect size is measured. Based on this information, a sample size that yields adequate power is calculated, and this sample size is used during the main study.",

They decide to conduct the study after a renowned journal published the results of an animal trial that showed the drug to be safe and effective in reducing blood pressure in pregnant chimps. No teratogenic effects were reported. The investigators receive a grant from the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug after the company contractually agrees not to influence the design, conduct, analysis, or publication of the trial in any way. The grant funds are designated to be used for expenses incurred in conducting the study. Other than a grant-drawn salary for the predetermined duration of the trial, no financial or material compensation would be offered to the investigators. The investigators propose to recruit a group of ten healthy pregnant women. Both the study participants and the fathers of their children would be informed in their native language, verbally as well as in writing, about the investigators' industry affiliation, the purpose and design of the study, the benefits and known side effects of the new drug, and the alternative options for treating pregnancy-induced hypertension. The participants would also be informed of their rights to confidentiality, to withdraw from the trial at any time, to free medical treatment as well as financial compensation in the event of harm to them or their fetus, and to decision-making autonomy regarding termination or continuation of the pregnancy, antenatal care, and medical or surgical treatment. For participating in the study, they would be offered subsidized antenatal care with a health care provider of their choosing, and the subsidy would not be stopped even if they were to withdraw after enrolling. The investigators would enroll the prospective participants only after the participant and the child's father confirm their understanding of the provided information and sign a consent form. Which of the following would most likely be the cause for the rejection of this study design by an institutional review board?",

        "explanation_why": "Vulnerable populations (e.g., pregnant women, neonates, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, economically or educationally disadvantaged individuals) are at increased risk of harm in clinical trials, and certain safeguards for protection of these populations are set in place by the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP). Before including pregnant women in clinical trials, preclinical trials in pregnant animals and clinical trials in nonpregnant individuals must have been conducted, and data regarding potential risks has to be available. Because the proposed trial was preceded only by an animal trial in pregnant chimps, it would most likely be rejected by an institutional review board. In addition to the animal trial, phase 0, I, II, and III clinical trials in nonpregnant women should be conducted to ensure the safety of the new drug.\n\nTwo of the central ethical requirements for clinical trials are voluntary participation and informed consent. The OHRP safeguards aim to ensure that vulnerable populations are not coerced (e.g., prisoners generally cannot be recruited for studies unless the research investigates health issues directly related to the prison population) and that those who may not be fully capable of informed consent are protected by all means (e.g., neonates can only participate in trials for the purpose of obtaining crucial biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by other means or has the potential to provide direct benefit to the neonate without posing any additional risk).",

Two months ago, she was enrolled in a randomized, single-blind, active-control equivalence trial involving an experimental combination chemotherapy regimen for AML. At every monthly visit, the study participants undergo chemotherapy along with a clinical evaluation and laboratory workup. The study participants are given prorated compensation following each visit. There is no additional compensation for completing the study. She has completed two of the four planned monthly cycles. On examination today, she appears tired but is in no apparent distress. During the evaluation, she says that she wants to “continue medical treatments” but would like to “withdraw from the study.” In addition to asking her why she wants to withdraw, which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician-investigator concerning the participant's request?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "A participant has a right to withdraw from a clinical trial at any time. The investigator should accept the decision without attempting to influence the participant in any way but may inquire about the reason for withdrawal to identify any potential risks or adverse events. In addition, the investigator should clarify whether the participant wants to withdraw completely (i.e., from all aspects of the study including follow-up) or only partially. Follow-up is important for ensuring the validity of the research and identifying adverse events that could negatively affect other participants. Informed consent on partial participation should be obtained. In the event of complete withdrawal, the participant should not be contacted for further study-related activities, and no additional information should be collected about them. The information collected to date may be kept.",

        "explanation_why": "The protocol for unblinding is determined by the institutional review board at the beginning of a trial. Specific circumstances, such as a subject's pregnancy or adverse events that affect safety, may require unblinding participants. Investigators may also decide to unblind participants after completion of the trial. However, withdrawal from a study is not an obligatory reason to unblind the participant and another action is more appropriate.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "The type of compensation is determined prior to study enrollment and should be uniformly applicable to all participants. Prorated compensation is used for studies involving multiple visits. This compensation model equitably distributes compensation among participants and pays participants a predetermined amount for each procedure and/or visit. With this compensation model, a participant who wishes to withdraw completely from the study should not be denied compensation that they have already earned but should not be offered compensation for the subsequent visits because such an action may go against the principle of justice for the other participants and risks imposing an element of undue influence on the withdrawing participant to remain (either completely or partially) in the study. Another action is necessary before discussing compensation.\n\nRegardless of the type of compensation model used, a study participant may be eligible for additional compensation if they experienced adverse events from the intervention.",

These patients are randomized to receive either the new drug or placebo for a period of one week. The primary endpoint of the trial is the time to resolution of symptoms from the onset of therapy and the secondary endpoint is the splenic volume as measured by ultrasonography one month after initiating therapy. At the end of the study, the mean differences of endpoint measures in each arm are determined and evaluated using t-statistics. For analysis, the investigators decide to exclude patients from both arms who did not adhere to the treatment protocol or dropped out of the study.

    "hint": "When analyzing data from a randomized controlled trial, the two main ways of dealing with study protocol violations (e.g., dropouts, nonadherence) are intention-to-treat analysis (ITT analysis), which includes all subjects (once randomized, always analyzed), and per-protocol analysis (PP analysis), which only includes subjects who adhered to the study protocol.",

        "explanation_why": "In a PP analysis, the evaluation of the effect of treatment assumes optimal trial conditions (i.e., an ideal scenario in which all patients receive and complete the treatment regimen they were assigned). In a real clinical scenario, however, patients may be nonadherent to treatment or lost to follow-up. This means that a PP analysis tends to overestimate the difference between outcomes in the treatment and placebo groups, which results in larger effect size (i.e., greater strength of association). Moreover, PP analysis increases the risk of biases (e.g., selection bias, confounding bias) because the original randomization of the trial is lost. On the other hand, an ITT analysis results in a smaller effect size (i.e., avoids overestimation of the new intervention's effect), greater generalizability (external validity) of results, and preserves randomization, which decreases the risk of bias.\n\nAn as-treated analysis (sometimes considered a subtype of PP analysis) evaluates patients according to the intervention they actually received, no matter which intervention they were originally assigned. This type of analysis is primarily used to assess the side effects of interventions.",

One group receives 6 mg of oral ivermectin once daily, one group receives 12 mg of oral ivermectin once daily, and one control group receives a placebo once daily. The primary endpoint is viral clearance measured as the mean number of days to a negative polymerase chain reaction test. The confidence level is set at 95%. Which of the following statistical methods is most appropriate to compare the results from the different treatment groups?",

ANOVA can be used to determine whether the difference in the means of the groups is statistically significant. In this study, the investigators are comparing the difference in the means (dependent, continuous variable) between the intervention groups (independent, categorical variable). ANOVA is therefore the most appropriate statistical method.\n\nThe difference between an unpaired t-test and an ANOVA test is that an unpaired t-test can only be performed when the independent variable is composed of no more than two categorical groups (e.g., female or male). Whenever there are three or more categories (e.g., 3 mg, 6 mg, and placebo), only an ANOVA can be performed. For 2 categories, the t-test and the ANOVA should yield the same results (under the condition that certain required assumptions around the distribution of data are true for the sample).",

On day 1 of the conference, the group is randomly split up into two subgroups of equal size. Every physician receives a questionnaire. The first subgroup receives questionnaires that assess the knowledge transfer of evidence-based medicine. The second subgroup receives questionnaires that explore the strategic approaches for the application of evidence-based medicine in the physicians' clinics. Both questionnaires contain a set of 10 questions. The physicians respond to each question by writing out short answers in a comment field. On day 2 of the conference, the replies to the questionnaires are anonymized and discussed within the subgroups. On day 3, both subgroups present their key takeaways. After the conference, an article with a summary of the findings is published in a national journal and the physicians decide to repeat the conference after 1 year to evaluate for changes over time. This study design is best described as which of the following?",

A high CV indicates that values are widely spread around the mean. In a system with multiple processes, such as the various aspects of a patient's visit, the process with the highest CV should be optimized first to improve the system's overall reliability and efficiency. Optimization of vital parameter measurements, which has the highest CV (5 ÷ 8 = 0.62), will therefore most likely have the greatest impact on reducing the average time that patients spend in the practice.\n\nIn contrast, SD, which is an absolute measure of dispersion, describes the variability of data in relation to the mean within a single data set.",

Yesterday, she saw a program on television about hepatitis E and its potential fulminant course in pregnant women. She feels well. Pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin; immunizations are up-to-date. The physician recently read a paper about a new test for HEV infection. The paper covered a trial that evaluated the efficacy of the new test in 145 pregnant women who presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain, fever, vomiting, and jaundice.

        "explanation_why": "The positive predictive value (PPV) is the likelihood that an individual with a positive test result truly has the disease, i.e., true positives/(true positives + false positives). PPV is directly related to pretest probability; PPV decreases as pretest probability decrease. Similarly, a decrease in prevalence results in a lower pretest probability and, therefore, a decrease in PPV. The study population prevalence of HEV infection in this scenario is 25/145 = 17%, which is certainly much higher than the prevalence of Hepatitis E for the general population. Negative predictive value (NPV) is inversely related to pretest probability; NPV increases as pretest probability decreases.\n\nPretest probability does not influence intrinsic test characteristics, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio.",

Medical history is otherwise remarkable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin since TAVR. Other medications include lisinopril and metformin. The patient feels well but is concerned about the number of pills she is taking. She asks about the benefit of taking “two blood clot pills” and wants to know whether she can discontinue one of them. The physician informs the patient that one important indication for antiplatelet therapy after TAVR is the risk of stroke. The physician reviews a recent metaanalysis comparing the effects of single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) to DAPT on the risk of disabling ischemic stroke 6–12 months after TAVR. The graph shows the results of the study. Based on the graph, which of the following conclusions about the metaanalysis is most appropriate?",

In a metaanalysis, publication bias can be evaluated with a funnel plot and certain statistical tests (e.g., Begg's and Egger's tests).

There are two studies (B and F) in this metaanalysis for which the CI does not include the null value, indicating statistically significant results.

        "explanation_why": "In this forest plot, the left column lists the included studies (A–F). The next column shows the primary outcome measure that is being compared between the studies, which is the relative risk (RR) of ischemic stroke in patients receiving SAPT versus DAPT 6–12 months after TAVR. The central vertical line on the x-axis represents the point of null effect (a RR of 1 in this scenario).\n\nThe results of each study are represented as squares and vertical and horizontal lines. The vertical line at the center of each square represents the point estimate of the effect of the intervention in the respective study, and the horizontal line of each square represents the confidence interval (CI) of the results (typically 95%). The area of each square is proportional to the weight that the corresponding study is given in the overall metaanalysis (e.g., based on sample size and/or statistical power). The larger the square, the more weight the result of the individual study carries.\n\nThe diamond at the bottom of the plot represents the combined results of all studies; its midpoint corresponds to the point estimate of the summary result, and its width reflects the CI.\n\nBecause the CI of the summary (i.e., diamond) in this forest plot crosses the vertical line of no effect (i.e., RR = 1), there is no statistically significant difference in the relative risk of ischemic stroke between patients on SAPT and those on DAPT in this study.",

This is not the same as saying that there is a 2% probability of obtaining the observed effect if the study is repeated.\n\nThe concept can be understood by flipping a coin twice with the H_0 of the coin not being loaded. There are three possible outcomes: two heads (HH), one head and one tail (HT or TH), and two tails (TT) with probabilities of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. If we get the outcome of HH, the p-value for this observation is the probability of obtaining HH plus the sum of the probabilities of outcomes as likely or less likely than HH, which would be 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.",

Although the study shows that the new antidiabetic drug leads to a statistically significant reduction in mean glucose concentration (p < 0.05), this 3 mg/dL decrease is unlikely to benefit patients and have a clinically significant impact on outcomes. Statistical significance and clinical significance do not necessarily correlate. In contrast to statistical significance, there are no predetermined parameters for measuring clinical significance. To estimate the clinical significance of a trial, effect size measures (e.g., Cohen-d, relative risk), impact on patient outcomes, and overall context of the disease, such as prevalence and course (e.g., mortality, morbidity), must be considered.",

For such a test, the positive likelihood ratio (LR^+), which is sensitivity/(1 - specificity), should be determined first. In this scenario, LR^+ is 10%/(100% - 90%) = 1, indicating that patients without pertussis are just as likely to have a positive test as patients with pertussis.\n\nSimilarly, a disease cannot effectively be ruled out using a test with a high sensitivity but very low specificity. For such a test, the negative likelihood ratio (LR^-), which is (1 - sensitivity)/specificity, should be determined first. In this scenario, LR^- is (100% - 10%)/90% = 1, indicating that patients with pertussis are just as likely to have a negative test as patients without pertussis.\n\nThis test with an LR^+ and LR^- of 1 has no clinical utility.

Protocol modifications need approval from the institutional review board and often require reconfirming informed consent for ongoing participation.

The only AE assessed was hypoglycemia, and the difference in incidence between the ambogliflozin group and those who received standard combination therapy was not statistically significant (i.e., 95% confidence interval of the relative risk includes the null value 1).

This study only included patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes with HbA_1c ≤ 8.5% who did not have concomitant diabetic neuropathy or previous kidney transplant. In addition, the study population consisted only of veterans, and 95% of the participants were men.

        "explanation_why": "In this study, the incidence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) has a relative risk (RR) of 0.6 in patients treated with ambogliflozin combination therapy compared to standard combination therapy. The confidence interval does not include the null value of 1 and the results are therefore statistically significant. When results of a study are presented as RR, the corresponding relative risk reduction (if RR < 1) is calculated as follows: % risk reduction = (1 - RR) x 100; relative risk increase (if RR > 1) is calculated as follows: % risk increase = (RR - 1) x 100. In this study, relative risk reduction is (1 - 0.6) x 100 = 40%.\n\nRelative risk reduction should not be confused with absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is calculated as follows: ARR = risk in control group - risk in treatment group. In this study, the ARR for DR would be 12% - 7% = 5%. The risk of developing DR in the ambogliflozin group is therefore 5% lower than the risk of developing DR in the standard combination therapy group.",

The efficacy and safety of the new vaccine have been demonstrated in a prior phase 2 trial sponsored by the same company. The researchers are conducting a trial in community hospitals in 350 towns. Each hospital is randomly assigned to administer either the standard vaccine or the new vaccine. All staff, patients, and visitors at each hospital are invited to enroll in the study. The data is collected by nurses who have full insight into the study protocol, including which group the hospital belongs to, and they transfer the data to the evaluating researchers who also have full insight into the protocol. Because they must keep records of potential side effects, the physician assistants administering the vaccines are also informed about which vaccines the participants are given. The participants are not informed about which of the two vaccines they receive. The endpoint is to compare the efficacy of the new vaccine to the standard vaccine and to form a hypothesis about its effect on herd immunity in immunocompromised individuals.

        "explanation_why": "In studies with a cluster design, participants are randomized in groups or clusters rather than individually. In this study, the clusters consist of hospitals, which are randomized into either the intervention group (new vaccine) or the control group (standard vaccine), and all participants at each hospital receive the same vaccine. Cluster randomized trials have a lower risk of contamination of intervention. For example, in this study, the effects of the two vaccines can be observed separately. If the participants had been individually randomized into intervention and control groups, each vaccine's efficacy would be difficult to evaluate because of the other vaccine's effects on herd immunity in the community. Other advantages of cluster randomization include typically lower costs than other study designs and simpler enrollment procedures. On the downside, cluster randomized trials have low statistical power because the units of analysis are groups rather than individual participants. In addition, recruitment bias can occur when participants are enrolled after interventions have already been allocated to clusters.",

Eight hundred white men between 40 and 60 years of age without preexisting illnesses are randomly assigned to receive the dietary supplement or placebo. After following the subjects for 10 years, the results of the trial show no statistically significant difference in the risk of developing T2DM between the subjects receiving the supplement and the group receiving the placebo. One year later, the researchers receive another grant and decide to further analyze the data collected during the trial. They now categorize the participants into 7 groups according to the participants' fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at the beginning of the trial. One group is categorized as FPG < 70 mg/dL; the other study participants are divided into 6 groups according to the following value ranges: 70–74 mg/dL, 75–79 mg/dL, 80–84 mg/dL, 85–89 mg/dL, 90–94 mg/dL, and 95–99 mg/dL.

In addition, the subgroup analysis compares one group with an FPG of 95–99 mg/dL with another group that has the same FPG.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In this scenario, subgroups (i.e., subjects of different groups, categorized according to their FPG) were determined and analyzed after the initial trial ended, raising concerns about the validity of the subgroup efficacy analysis. Posthoc subgroup analysis of the same data is associated with an increased rate of false positives or false negatives and increases the chance of coincidentally discovering statistically significant results. In addition, subgroups also have a smaller number of subjects, which leads to reduced statistical power of the subgroup analysis, making it difficult to identify true subgroup effects. The results of posthoc subgroup analysis should not be used to infer treatment effects or make clinical decisions but can be used for hypothesis generation for further clinical studies.\n\nIf subgroup analysis will be performed as a part of the study to infer treatment effects or make clinical decisions, the subgroups should be determined a priori (during the study design phase) in order to avoid selection bias and to ensure adequate sample sizes within each subgroup. In addition, only a small number of subgroups should be analyzed to avoid the multiple comparisons problem. Finally, the expected subgroup effect (direction and magnitude) should be defined before the trial and based on logical reasoning (e.g., pathophysiological considerations).",
        "explanation_but": "A prominent example that demonstrates the limitations of posthoc subgroup analyses is the second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2). The authors performed a posthoc subgroup analysis based on astrological birth signs on their data. According to this analysis, patients born under the astrological signs of Libra and Gemini did not benefit from one month of daily aspirin after myocardial infarction. The result of the analysis was statistically significant. The authors reported this outcome as an example of the questionable nature of posthoc subgroup analyses.\n\nRandomized trial of intravenous streptokinase, oral aspirin, both, or neither among 17,187 cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction: ISIS-2.

        "explanation_why": "The likelihood ratio (LR) represents the probability of a positive or negative test result in someone with the disease of interest over the probability of the test result in someone without the disease. LRs reflect how much more likely a disease is in a person with a given test result compared to their pretest probability. The lower the value of the negative likelihood ratio (i.e., the closer to 0 it is), the larger the effect of a negative test result in reducing the post-test probability of disease. LR^- is calculated using the equation (1 - sensitivity)/specificity. In this scenario, the LR^- of Test D is (1 - 0.85)/0.9 = 0.17, which is the lowest LR^- of the four tests. LR^- < 0.1 indicates that the test is effective at ruling out the presence of disease.\n\nSimilarly, a high positive likelihood ratio (LR^+) indicates that a positive test strongly increases the post-test probability of disease. LR^+ is calculated using the equation sensitivity/(1 - specificity). An LR^+ > 10 indicates that the test is highly effective at ruling in a disease.",

In this case, data were complete and available for four outcomes of interest.

        "explanation_why": "The RR estimates the ratio of the probability of an outcome (e.g., recurrence of urinary tract infections) occurring in an exposed group (e.g., those receiving treatment) to the probability of the outcome occurring in an unexposed group (e.g., those receiving placebo). An RR < 1.0 indicates that a given treatment decreases the probability of an outcome. The CI provides a range of plausible values for the true RR based on the available data. A CI that does not include 1.0 indicates a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Finally, the width of the CI provides information about the precision of the estimate. If the RR estimate is 0.78 and the CI is 0.71–0.86, the intervention likely has a protective effect, and the magnitude of that effect (relative risk reduction) could be anywhere from 14–29%. The narrower the CI, the more precise the RR estimate. Therefore, approach A has the set of results that shows a protective effect (i.e., an RR <1.0 with a CI that does not include 1.0) with the most precision (i.e., the narrowest CI).",

However, participants do not always fully follow the protocol they were assigned to; for example, they might discontinue the intervention because of adverse events, cross over to the alternative intervention, or not return for follow-up. In an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, all study participants are analyzed according to the group that they were originally randomized to (analyzed as-randomized), regardless of whether they followed the full protocol for that group or even remained in the study. Thereby, ITT analysis preserves the benefits of the randomization, reduces selection bias, and better reflects real-world settings (where patients do not always follow the treatment plans laid out for them), but it may also underestimate the true efficacy of an intervention.\n\nThe converse of ITT analysis is per-protocol analysis, in which study participants who deviated from their assigned study protocol are excluded from analysis.",

A urinalysis is positive for white cells, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites. The physician prescribes a 10-day course of oral cefixime and discusses close follow-up with the family. One week later, the patient is afebrile, eating well, and in no distress. A voiding cystourethrogram shows grade 2 vesicoureteral reflux. The family asks how to proceed. In reviewing the literature, the physician finds a randomized controlled trial regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent subsequent urinary tract infections and renal scarring in young children with vesicoureteral reflux. Which of the following statements about this study’s design is correct?",

A urinalysis is positive for white cells, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites. The physician prescribes a 10-day course of oral cefixime and discusses close follow-up with the family. One week later, the patient is afebrile, eating well, and in no distress. A voiding cystourethrogram shows grade 2 vesicoureteral reflux. The family asks how to proceed. In reviewing the literature, the physician finds a randomized controlled trial regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent subsequent urinary tract infections and renal scarring in young children with vesicoureteral reflux.

        "explanation_why": "The primary advantage of RCTs is high internal validity so that a causal inference can be made about the intervention (in this case, prophylactic antibiotics) and the outcome (urinary tract infections and renal scarring). Random allocation to the treatment groups (which leads to balancing of potential confounders between the groups) and blinding allow the investigators to attribute any observed differences in the primary outcome between treatment groups to the intervention and not to other causes. Thus, the advantage of the study identified is that it allows the researchers to determine whether prophylactic antibiotics are beneficial in preventing urinary tract infections and scarring.\n\nPatients that sign up for RCTs tend to differ from people in the broader population, making generalizability of the results to the larger population difficult. RCTs are costly and time-consuming, so recruiting an adequate sample size to account for heterogeneity can be difficult. Therefore, the results of this trial may not apply to all children with vesicoureteral reflux, only those who match the characteristics of the trial participants.",

However, a more useful concept for clinicians who are interpreting diagnostic tests are the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV). The PPV and NPV depend on both the intrinsic characteristics of the test and the pretest probability that the patient has the condition of interest.",

        "explanation_why": "The pretest probability is best approximated from the prevalence of the condition in a population similar to that of the patient in question. In this particular scenario, the PPV is the proportion of all 2-year-old children with an upper respiratory infection and a positive rapid-test result who actually have influenza infection, as determined on a gold-standard test (polymerase-chain-reaction assay or viral culture). Using the same diagnostic test in a population with higher disease prevalence increases the PPV; that is, someone who tests positive is more likely to have true disease. Conversely, increased prevalence results in decreased NPV; individuals who test negative are more likely to actually have disease. Therefore, when considering predictive values of diagnostic tests, it is important to take into account the influence of the prevalence of disease.",

For example, in this study, a possible confounder is air pollution, which could be associated with both household tobacco smoke (the exposure of interest) and the development of childhood asthma (the outcome of interest). If this confounder is not properly accounted for, then the observed association between household tobacco smoke and childhood asthma could be incorrectly interpreted to signify causation. Researchers can address and reduce confounding during study design (by e.g., randomization, matching) and/or study analysis (by using e.g., stratified analysis, multiple regression analysis).",

RCTs attempt to isolate the intervention so that any effects on the outcome are solely attributed to the intervention instead of other factors.

Given these values, the positive likelihood ratio can be calculated as follows: 0.95/(1–0.95) = 19. A high LR^+ (> 10) indicates that the test is excellent at confirming a disease. The negative likelihood ratio compares the probability of a person without the disease of interest testing negative to the probability of a person with the disease testing negative. For this scenario, it can be calculated as follows: LR^- = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity = (1–0.95)/0.95 = 0.05. A low negative likelihood ratio (< 0.1) indicates that a negative test is good at ruling out the presence of disease. Together, these ratios suggest that the test performs well in accurately detecting the presence of disease.\n\nIf the likelihood ratio of a diagnostic test is 1, it has poor clinical utility.",

He is approached about participating in a research study of patients being evaluated for appendicitis, and he consents. The goal of the study is to validate a new point-of-care test measuring “serum protein Y” to diagnose appendicitis in patients presenting with abdominal pain. The outcome of whether appendicitis was present will be established by validation based on experts’ retrospective review of the clinical, laboratory, and imaging data as well as histopathologic examination of the appendix in patients who undergo appendectomy. These data will be used to establish whether the test for “serum protein Y” may be useful in diagnosing appendicitis preoperatively. The patient is informed that participating in the study will not provide any benefit to himself but that the results may benefit future patients. During the patient’s evaluation, an abdominal CT scan reveals mild thickening of the appendix with signs of surrounding inflammation. He is scheduled for urgent surgical exploration of the appendix. As part of the study protocol, a research assistant obtains a drop of blood with a fingerstick. The result of the “serum protein Y” returns very low, which the investigators have hypothesized may indicate low risk for appendicitis. The research assistant enters the result into the study database for future analysis. The patient continues to await his surgery. At the current time, who of the following should the research assistant inform about the results of the experimental test?",

For the past 3 years, he has engaged in an exercise program and attempted to diet by restricting calories and following various supervised weight-loss programs. Although he lost some weight with these interventions, he quickly regained it. With his new diabetes diagnosis, both he and his parents are increasingly concerned about the effect of his weight on his health. They ask the physician whether bariatric surgery could provide a longer-lasting weight-loss solution and reverse his diabetes diagnosis. In looking for answers to their question, the physician finds a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that enrolled adults and adolescents with obesity who were about to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The participants were followed longitudinally with serial measurements of outcomes related to weight loss and remission of comorbid conditions. The 5-year outcomes of that trial showed that adolescents seemed to derive similar benefits to adults, with maintenance of weight loss at 5 years. Which of the following is a common limitation with this type of study design?",

This type of study provides a direct measure of risk difference (incidence in the exposed group minus incidence in the unexposed group). In this example, the exposed cohort would be those who had exposure to bisphenol A, and the outcome would be the development of pancreatic cancer.\n\nAn alternative way to address this question would be a case-control study. In this type of study, researchers enroll individuals who already have or do not have the outcome in question (in this case, pancreatic cancer).

In this case, the clinicians want to make inferences about the mean BMI of their clinic population based on their random sample. However, the mean BMI of the sample population is likely not identical to the mean BMI of the clinic population; if the clinicians chose other similarly sized samples, they would get slightly different mean BMIs. By repeatedly choosing different samples and calculating a sample mean each time, it becomes possible to calculate the standard deviation (SD) of those sample means, which is the SEM. The SEM can be estimated by dividing the sample SD by the square root of the sample size: SEM = SD / √(sample size). If either the sample size increases or the SD of the measurement decreases, then the SEM decreases and the precision increases.",

If there is a wide range of BMI values, then the SD will be large; if there is a narrow range, then the SD will be small. Although the SD is needed to calculate the measurement that is most useful in assessing the precision of a sample mean in estimating a population mean, it does not (on its own) allow for inferences about the population.",

The physician is considering a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis and recalls that a genetic test for HLA-B27 may be helpful in diagnosing this condition. She obtains a family history, which is negative for ankylosing spondylitis, and the patient reports predominantly European ancestry. Consulting a reference, the physician finds that 90% of men of European ancestry with ankylosing spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive, and 10% of healthy men of European ancestry (i.e., without ankylosing spondylitis) are HLA-B27 positive. Given this patient’s history and physical examination, she estimates the patient’s probability of having ankylosing spondylitis (i.e., the pretest probability) is 10%. If this patient tests positive for HLA-B27, which of the following is the likelihood that he truly has ankylosing spondylitis?",

        "explanation_why": "To calculate the PPV, one must know the sensitivity and specificity of a test as well as the patient’s probability of having the disease of interest (i.e., the pretest probability). The sensitivity of HLA-B27 in this population is 90%, given that 90% of men of European ancestry with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are HLA-B27 positive. The specificity is also 90%, given that 90% of men of European ancestry without AS will be HLA-B27 negative. In a hypothetical population of 100 back-pain patients with a 10% pretest probability of AS, 10 will have AS, and 9 of them will be HLA-B27 positive. Conversely, 90 patients will not have AS, and 81 of them will be HLA-B27 negative. The corresponding two-by-two table is shown below. The table shows that only 9 of the 18 patients who are HLA-B27 positive have the disease; thus, the positive predictive value is 50% (PPV = true positives ÷ all patients who tested positive). Stated another way, even if this patient tests positive for HLA-B27, his probability of having AS is still only 50%.",

It is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the absolute risk difference between groups. The NNT represents the number of participants, on average, who need to receive a given intervention to prevent one more adverse outcome than would have occurred in the control setting. In other words, in this study, if 100 patients were treated with the new vaccine rather than the old vaccine, one case of laboratory-confirmed influenza would be prevented.\n\nNNT is often considered a more intuitive measure for clinical decision-making than a relative risk or odds ratio. It is especially useful in cases of a single intervention with a definitive end point, such as confirmed disease or death. Of note, it must always be used in the context of a comparator (i.e., the control group); it is not a measure of the effect of an intervention on its own.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In a normal distribution, two SDs above and below the mean cover 95% of the sample. Using the data from the study, we can therefore determine the range of weight loss experienced by 95% of the participants in the intervention group during one year of follow-up. The lower end of the range is found by subtracting two SDs from the mean: 14.1 - 2(5.2) = 3.7 kg (31 - 2(11) = 9 lb). The upper end of the range is found by adding two SDs to the mean: 14.1 + 2(5.2) = 24.5 kg (31 + 2(11) = 53 lb). Hence, approximately 95% of participants in the intervention group had a one-year weight loss of between 3.7 kg and 24.5 kg (9 lb and 53 lb).",

        "explanation_why": "Metaanalysis is a method of collecting and analyzing data from multiple studies to create a numerical summary and estimate of effect. Metaanalysis provides evidence of reproducibility of results and, potentially, a more precise estimate of effect than a single study. It is therefore particularly useful when different studies yield different estimates of the overall effect of interest. Moreover, pooling studies together increases statistical power. Analyzing data from randomized controlled trials retains the benefits of randomization.\n\nMetaanalysis is only as good as the data being analyzed, which is one of its main limitations. If a metaanalysis includes studies that were designed with a high risk of bias or studies that have slightly different end points, the results will be less reliable or informative than if the analysis included only higher-quality studies or studies with the same end points. Metaanalyses can also amplify publication bias because they only include published studies, and negative studies are less likely to be submitted or published.",

These studies are very useful for rare diseases, but the investigators do not follow patients over time and thus cannot calculate incidence. Although a case-control study comparing the procalcitonin levels among burn patients who developed sepsis with those who did not would be a valid design, it would be less informative and more prone to bias than study types that are higher on the hierarchy of evidence.",

        "explanation_why": "All clinical research studies are subject to both random and systematic error that can lead to incorrect conclusions about the answer to a research question. The hierarchy of evidence stipulates that different study designs have different inferential power and different likelihoods of systematic error. Randomized controlled trials are at the top of the hierarchy for most clinical questions, but are not always feasible. For observational studies, metaanalysis of cohort studies has the highest strength of evidence, followed by prospective cohort study, retrospective cohort study, case-control study, cross-sectional study, and case series.\n\nA metaanalysis of prospective cohort studies has the advantage of effectively increasing the sample size (by including information from multiple studies or sources) and using statistical methods to pool the results. Although each study included in the metaanalysis may be subject to bias in one direction or another, the combination of study results is more likely to lead to an accurate approximation of a statistical association than any one study alone.",
