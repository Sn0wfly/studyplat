    "hint": "The patient presents with signs of distal intestinal obstruction (delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distention, bilious vomiting), and a DRE shows anal sphincter hypertonicity with an explosive release of stool and air, indicating elevated intraluminal pressure in the colon. X-ray of the abdomen shows megacolon with an area of distal narrowing. These findings are highly suggestive of Hirschsprung disease.",

        "explanation_why": "Ischemic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa is seen in necrotizing enterocolitis, which can manifest with abdominal distention and bilious vomiting shortly after birth, However, an x-ray would typically show bowel wall edema, pneumatosis intestinalis, and/or free air within the abdomen (due to intestinal perforation). Also, patients typically have a history of bloody diarrhea (unlike this neonate, who has delayed passage of meconium), and the child would appear seriously ill with cardiopulmonary instability. Moreover, this patient lacks the risk factors commonly associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, such as preterm birth and neonatal asphyxia.",

However, the small bowel would be distended (not the large bowel), since intussusception typically occurs at the ileocolic junction. Moreover, intussusception usually occurs between 5 months and 3 years of age; it is extremely rare in the neonatal period. Finally, blood in the rectum is often found on digital rectal examination, which was not the case here.",

        "explanation_why": "Impaired migration of neural crest cells is the underlying cause of Hirschsprung disease. Parasympathetic neural crest cells migrate in a rostral to caudal direction, from the foregut to the midgut to the hindgut. Failure of the neural crest cells to complete this migration typically results in an aganglionic distal sigmoid and rectum (i.e., without the myenteric and submucosal plexus). As a result, there is hypertonicity in the walls of the rectum and sigmoid, and the internal anal sphincter fails to relax in response to rectal distention. The net effect is intestinal obstruction and dilation of the colon (megacolon). The diagnosis is confirmed via rectal biopsy, which would show aganglionosis, increased acetylcholinesterase activity, and/or hyperplasia of parasympathetic fibers.",

Carbamazepine can result in maternal folate deficiency, which prevents proper closure of the neural plate in the embryo during the fourth week of pregnancy. Most commonly, the caudal end of the neural tube is affected, which results in spina bifida. Carbamazepine may also cause developmental delay, cleft palate, skeletal abnormalities (e.g., finger hypoplasia), and cardiovascular abnormalities. All women should receive folate supplementation during pregnancy, particularly when receiving a folate antagonist.\n\nThere is no antiepileptic drug that is not teratogenic. If a pregnant woman, or a woman wishing to conceive, requires antiseizure treatment, an agent should be chosen that controls seizures and is tolerated well by the mother at the lowest effective dose. Valproate, however, should generally be avoided in pregnancy.",

This channel is formed when the processus vaginalis fails to obliterate in utero, allowing for communication with the peritoneal cavity (e.g., accumulation of peritoneal fluid, protrusion of intestinal organs, etc.). A communicating hydrocele may increase in size with crying or the Valsalva maneuver (i.e., on increases in intra-abdominal pressure) but is often reducible, as seen in this patient. As such, all hydroceles must be distinguished from inguinal hernias (a palpable mass as opposed to a fluctuant mass).\n\nCongenital hydroceles usually resolve spontaneously, but surgery may be indicated in prolonged forms to prevent an inguinal hernia.",

        "explanation_why": "Failure of the ductus arteriosus to completely close postnatally allows blood to flow from the descending aorta back to the pulmonary artery (left-to-right shunt). In a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), this leads to volume overload of the right ventricle and the lung circuit. This increased blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension and irreversible remodeling of small pulmonary vessels, which may eventually lead to an Eisenmenger reaction (shunt reversal). This patient's palpable right parasternal heave and pronounced S_2 are evidence of increased right heart strain. In patients with a large PDA, the features of differential cyanosis occur once shunt reversal develops. Because the ductus is located on the descending aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, reversal of the shunt results in deoxygenated blood reaching only the lower body. Due to the rise in pulmonary pressure, the characteristic continuous machine-like murmur heard in patients with PDA eventually disappears.\n\nInfants with PDA usually receive an infusion of indomethacin to induce closure of the duct, while in older children symptomatic PDAs are typically closed surgically or via percutaneous catheter occlusion. The presence of an Eisenmenger reaction is, however, a contraindication to a PDA closure.",

        "explanation_why": "Abnormal narrowing at the aortic isthmus is consistent with coarctation of the aorta (CoA), which would cause differential cyanosis if the CoA is severe (i.e., a ductal-dependent congenital heart defect) but this differential cyanosis would be evident from the neonatal period. In addition, patients with CoA have a brachio-femoral pulse delay rather than synchronous pulses. The symptoms of a mild CoA can begin later in life but in such a scenario, differential cyanosis would not be expected. Instead, patients present with features of brachiocephalic hypertension (e.g., headaches, epistaxis), lower extremity arterial insufficiency (manifesting with claudication and cool skin with faint or unpalpable pulses, but no cyanosis), and evidence of compensatory collateral arteries (e.g., continuous murmur over the back).",

            "description": "(1) Hypoplasia of aorta can lead to hypertension (↑ BP) in the head and upper limbs as well as poststenotic hypoperfusion. In patent ductus arteriosus, this can be compensated by a right-to-left-shunt of blood from the pulmonary arteries into the aorta, resulting in the flow of mixed blood with decreased oxygen saturation (↓ SaO_2) to the general circulation.(2) After closure of the ductus arteriosus, the right-to-left shunt is absent (~ SaO_2) and there is hypoperfusion (↓ BP) of the abdominal organs and lower extremities with oxygenated blood.",

        "explanation_why": "Testicular germ cell tumors are divided into two groups: seminomas (most common) and nonseminoma tumors. Nonseminoma tumors include embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumors, testicular choriocarcinomas, teratomas, and tumors with mixed germ cell histology. Pure teratomas typically do not cause an elevation in testicular tumor markers (beta-hCG, AFP, PLAP), which is consistent with this patient's laboratory studies. Teratomas are more common in children but are usually benign in this patient group. In adult males, they are rare but more often malignant.\n\nUnlike hydroceles, testicular tumors do not transilluminate on examination. Typically, testicular tumors should not be percutaneously biopsied because a biopsy can cause seeding of malignant cells in the scrotum.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Persistence of the urogenital membrane is associated with the development of posterior urethral valves, which, due to the fetus's inability to properly excrete urine, can lead to oligohydramnios. Severe oligohydramnios results in Potter sequence, which consists of craniofacial abnormalities, clubbed feet, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Posterior urethral valves can cause bladder dysfunction but are not associated with epispadias or bladder exstrophy.",

Bifid scrotum is associated with hypospadias, not epispadias or bladder exstrophy.

The cyst can develop anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct and manifests as a painless, firm, midline mass of the anterior neck. Like the thyroid gland, the thyroglossal cyst is enclosed within the pretracheal fascia, which is responsible for the upward movement of these structures during swallowing. In addition, a thyroglossal cyst moves upward with tongue protrusion because the fibrous remnants of the thyroglossal duct are connected to the base of the tongue.",

Neonates with HLHS also have weak peripheral pulses, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis as the hypoplastic left ventricle cannot maintain adequate cardiac output.

Exertion, such as crying or feeding, increases the RVOO. This results in cyanosis (tet spells) due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the VSD instead of the pulmonary valve, which in turn causes the murmur to become softer. The right ventricle hypertrophies because it chronically pumps against high resistance caused by the RVOO.\n\nOlder children with TOF tend to squat during a tet spell. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which increases left ventricular pressure and decreases the right-to-left shunting of blood through the VSD. Infants who are having a tet spell should be placed with their knees toward their chest to achieve the same effect.",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with Klinefelter syndrome have testosterone deficiency beginning at puberty due to testicular dysgenesis. Decreased testosterone levels lead to a loss of the negative feedback loop to the hypothalamus and a compensatory increase in FSH and LH. Increased FSH levels stimulate aromatase synthesis, which leads to increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This hormonal imbalance manifests as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and a eunuchoid growth pattern. Additional features of Klinefelter syndrome include sparse body hair, azoospermia, and mitral valve prolapse.",

Cryptorchidism adversely affects Sertoli cell function, which leads to impaired spermatogenesis and decreased inhibin levels. Leydig cells are unaffected, so testosterone production remains normal.

        "explanation_why": "Increased peripheral sex hormones and decreased central sex hormones are diagnostic of autonomous excessive sex hormone production. This condition can be caused by sex hormone-producing tumors (e.g., Leydig-cell tumor), McCune-Albright syndrome, some types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and exogenous hormone administration. Patients typically develop precocious puberty. Klinefelter syndrome presents with a different pattern of sex hormone disturbance",

        "explanation_why": "Arrested endodermal migration of the thyroid gland from the pharyngeal floor describes the process by which a thyroglossal duct cyst or ectopic thyroid can arise. This patient's technetium-99m scan shows thyroid tissue within the tongue, the most common location of ectopic thyroid tissue. As in this case, enlargement of ectopic thyroid is common with URIs due to the thyroid's lymphoid tissue and can cause dysphagia and dyspnea. Surgical removal of a lingual thyroid may result in hypothyroidism if there is no other site of thyroid tissue. Some patients with thyroid ectopia develop symptoms of hypothyroidism, which could explain this patient's dry and cool skin.",

However, inflammation would be expected at the anterior neck (i.e., midline mass), rather than the tongue. Furthermore, a technetium-99m scan in a patient with a thyroglossal duct cyst would show uptake at the normally positioned thyroid gland, which is not the case here.",

Multiple dilated gas-filled loops of bowel (examples indicated by green line) are seen proximal to a point of abrupt termination of the distal colon. Beyond this (double arrow), no gas continues to the anus.The appearance is consistent with imperforate anus (anal atresia). The distance between the gas column and the coin can be measured to determine the length of the atretic segment. Imperforate anus can be associated with other congenital abnormalities, among them esophageal atresia, VACTERL association, caudal regression syndrome, trisomy 21, and Currarino triad.",

Maternal use of vasoconstrictive drugs (e.g., cocaine, MDMA, or cigarettes) increases the risk for this malformation.\n\nIntestinal atresia of any origin is suggested by a prenatal history of polyhydramnios, since the fetus cannot drink the amniotic fluid due to the intestinal obstruction.",

Features in addition to those seen in this newborn include microphthalmia/anophthalmia, coloboma, low-set, malformed ears, polycystic kidney disease, and capillary hemangiomata. Approximately 80% of affected children have a congenital heart defect, as suspected in this newborn, whose heart murmur is consistent with a ventricular septal defect. Only supportive treatment is available for infants with trisomy 13, and the prognosis is usually very poor (only 11% of infants survive past 12 months of age).",

The etiology is thought to be multifactorial, including both genetic (e.g., trisomy 13, mutations in sonic hedgehog signaling pathway) and environmental (e.g., alcohol and retinoic acid exposure in utero) components. Holoprosencephaly can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasonography and fetal MRI; however, polyhydramnios is not a characteristic finding.

The most important risk factor associated with NTDs is folate deficiency, either due to dietary shortage or the consumption of folic acid antagonists (e.g., valproate, carbamazepine). Because anencephaly is an open NTD that leaves the neural tube exposed, α-fetoprotein (AFP) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can diffuse freely into the amniotic fluid and maternal serum. If both AFP and AChE are elevated in the amniotic fluid, fetal NTDs can be diagnosed with high accuracy, even if ultrasonography is inconclusive.",

The dorsal pancreatic bud is a dorsal outpouching of the distal foregut and differentiates into the body, tail, and the anterior aspect of the head of the pancreas. The ventral pancreatic bud is an outpouching of the future common bile duct and differentiates into the uncinate process and posterior aspect of the pancreatic head. The rotation of the foregut (blue arrow) connects the two pancreatic buds, with fusion occurring around the 8^th week of gestation.In normal development (top right image), the distal portion of the dorsal pancreatic duct fuses with the ventral pancreatic duct to form the main pancreatic duct, while the proximal portion of the dorsal duct either degenerates or persists as the accessory pancreatic duct.In pancreas divisum, a common developmental abnormality, the buds fuse but the ducts fail to do so and continue to drain separately (indicated by dashed red line).",

            "description": "Omphalocele: herniation of intraabdominal contents through an anterior abdominal wall defect at the base of the umbilical cord caused by the failure of the midgut to return to the abdominal cavity after its physiological herniation through the umbilical ring. Accordingly, the hernial sac is formed by the amniotic membrane and peritoneum, and the umbilical cord lies at the apex of the hernia.Gastroschisis: a developmental defect of the anterior abdominal wall in the paraumbilical region through which intraabdominal contents prolapse. As it is the anterior abdominal wall that fails to develop correctly, there is no outer peritoneal or membranous covering.Congenital umbilical hernia: herniation of intraabdominal contents through a patent umbilical orifice, which typically closes by 2 years of age. The sac of a paraumbilical hernia is the peritoneum.Diastasis recti: an abnormally wide separation of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles. The abdominal fascia are intact. There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up).",

The duct is normally obliterated by the 6^th week of intrauterine life. However, incomplete obliteration leads to the development of a diverticulum located approx. 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve (right image). The Meckel diverticulum is often connected to the navel via a fibrous cord, which is the obliterated part of the omphalomesenteric duct (middle image).",

She was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. Examination following delivery showed no abnormalities and she was discharged two days later. She is exclusively breastfed. She appears ill. She is at the 70^th percentile for length and 20^th percentile for weight. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 168/min, and respirations are 66/min. Her blood pressure is 91/69 mm Hg in the right arm, 90/70 mm Hg in the left arm, 72/67 mm Hg in the right lower limb, and 70/68 mm Hg in the left lower limb. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98% in the right hand and 78% in the right foot. On examination, subcostal retractions are seen and the liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Chest auscultation discloses fine crepitations in both lung fields and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left paravertebral interscapular area. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",

Her menstrual cycle is irregular, and she does not recall when her last menstrual period was. She drinks two to three beers daily and occasionally smokes cigarettes. She has several male sexual partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 71/min, and blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m^2. Pelvic examination shows a group of small vesicles on an erythematous base over the labia majora and minora with tender, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Ultrasonography discloses an intrauterine pregnancy consistent with 14 weeks' gestation with no detectable heartbeat. The fetal cranial vault is absent, there is no visible brain tissue, and there is mild polyhydramnios. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented the defect in this fetus?",

This patient's lack of prenatal care resulted in folate deficiency and subsequent fetal anencephaly. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends daily supplementation of 0.4–0.8 mg oral folic acid for all individuals capable of pregnancy for at least ≥ 4 weeks before trying to conceive, and supplementation should be continued until 12 weeks' gestation.",

She was born at home at 39 weeks' gestation after an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother reports having occasional headaches during pregnancy. The parents had refused prenatal care. The patient is 43.2 cm (17 in) in length and weighs 2180 g (4 lb 13 oz). Her blood pressure is 44/26 mmHg. Examination shows a large and soft anterior fontanel. The parietal bones are palpable only over the lateral surface of the cranium. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows bilateral renal hypoplasia. Which of the following medications did the mother most likely take during pregnancy?",

Other harmful side effects of ACE inhibitors, when taken after the first trimester, include oligohydramnios and its complications (e.g., intrauterine growth restriction, Potter sequence), poor cranial ossification (e.g., hypocalvaria), and fetal death. ACE inhibitors are also associated with cardiovascular and CNS malformations when taken during the first trimester. Therefore, ACE inhibitors should be avoided during pregnancy. Pregnant patients with new or existing hypertension should be treated with an antihypertensive that is safe for use during pregnancy (e.g. methyldopa). Renal hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, and IUGR can already be detected during prenatal ultrasonography.\n\nA healthy newborn must pass urine within 24 hours of birth. Other causes of fetal renal hypoplasia include environmental factors (e.g., maternal nutritional deficiencies, maternal diabetes).",
