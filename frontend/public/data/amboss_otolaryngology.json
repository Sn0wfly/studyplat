Impaired ciliary function reduces mucociliary clearance, resulting in bronchiectasis (due to recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, which are responsible for this patient's crackles and wheezing on examination) and chronic sinusitis. It also renders sperm immotile, which reduces fertility, and can cause dextrocardia (because cilia are responsible for the position of internal organs during embryological development). Other clinical features of PCD include chronic otitis media and conductive hearing loss. Kartagener syndrome is a subtype of PCD characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.\n\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia can also be caused by defects in ciliary assembly proteins or radial spokes.",

        "explanation_why": "Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) is caused by an autosomal recessive defect in CD18 (beta-2 integrin), which prevents leukocyte migration to the site of infection. As a result, patients have recurrent mucocutaneous infections that can progress to sepsis and a characteristic absence of pus or neutrophils at the site of infection. Other features of the condition include poor wound healing with large skin ulcers, delayed separation of the umbilical cord due to omphalitis, and severe periodontitis/gingivitis. A very high neutrophil count (as high as 100,000/mm^3 during active infection) is seen because neutrophil activation and recruitment of neutrophils from the non-circulating pool occurs. However, neutrophils are unable to extravasate into tissues, causing pooling within the circulation.\n\nLAD1 is diagnosed using flow cytometric measurement of surface molecules such as CD11b or CD18. The treatment for mild to moderate cases is mainly supportive, with early treatment of infections and prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if needed, but severe cases require definitive therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

        "explanation_why": "Voice pitch limitation is caused by damage to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN), which occurs in up to 30% of thyroid dissections. The external branch of the SLN innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for lengthening, thinning, and stiffening the vocal cords and increases the pitch of phonation. The cricothyroid muscle is the only tensor of the vocal cord, and its denervation results in an inability to increase the pitch of the voice or produce explosive sounds as well as easy voice fatigability.",

            "description": "The thyroid gland is located in front of the trachea in the lower neck and consists of two lobes connected by an isthmus. A third pyramidal lobe extending from the isthmus is present in 50% of patients. This third lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct.The parathyroid glands are located posterior to the thyroid gland; they may vary in number and location. The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) branch off from the vagus nerve; the left RLN loops under the aortic arch, and the right RLN passes beneath the subclavian artery. Both RLNs are vulnerable to injury during thyroid surgery as they ascend to the larynx behind the thyroid gland. Unilateral RLN injury may result in hoarseness, and bilateral RLN injury may cause dyspnea and stridor.",

Hypoparathyroidism is the most frequent complication of total or near-total thyroidectomy. However, the superior parathyroid glands are most commonly found inferior to the superior thyroid artery and the external branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and are thus less likely to be injured in this patient.",

This causes the affected vocal fold to rest in the paramedian or lateralized position. Coughing, which requires transient tight glottic closure, may then become ineffective. While unilateral RLN injury can occur during thyroid surgery, the nerve is unlikely to be damaged during ligation of the superior thyroid artery. Instead, the RLN is at risk during preparation of the inferior pole of the thyroid gland, as it runs close to the inferior thyroid artery.",

She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on microscopic examination of the mass?",

Afterward, thyroid hormone replacement therapy (i.e., levothyroxine) in the highest possible dose (according to the patient's tolerance) will be initiated to suppress TSH and thus reduce the risk of stimulating remaining malignant tissue.",

        "explanation_why": "A common finding in patients with IM is splenomegaly, which increases the risk of splenic rupture. Although this patient's abdominal examination shows no abnormalities, the spleen may still be or become enlarged. Since splenic rupture is most likely to occur 2–21 days after symptom onset, patients should avoid strenuous physical activity (e.g., soccer) for at least 3 weeks after initial symptoms develop and avoid contact sports (e.g., football, wrestling) for at least 4 weeks. Treatment of IM is mainly symptomatic and involves antipyretic and analgesic therapy (e.g., acetaminophen).",

However, lymphocytosis and a positive heterophile antibody test indicate EBV infection. Patients with EBV infection are often mistakenly treated with aminopenicillins because IM presents similarly to streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsilitis and these conditions are also typically diagnosed clinically. Additionally, rapid GAS antigen detection tests (rapid strep tests) can be positive in IM due to asymptomatic colonization of the pharynx with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Administering aminopenicillin to patients with IM should be avoided to prevent the potential complication of a pruritic, macular erythematous rash developing 5–9 days later.",

        "explanation_why": "Fever, exudative tonsillitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and leukocytosis are all indicative of infectious mononucleosis (IM), which is caused by an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Although IM itself does not usually cause a rash, a morbilliform rash commonly occurs in patients with this condition who are mistakenly administered an aminopenicillin with the intent of treating a bacterial infection (e.g., streptococcal pharyngitis, which also manifests with fever, sore throat, and cervical lymphadenopathy). The diagnosis of IM is typically clinical but EBV serology is the most reliable laboratory study. Anti-VCA IgM antibodies alone are sufficient to diagnose acute infection. A positive heterophile agglutination test (monospot test) can support the diagnosis but carries a high risk of false positive and false negative results and is therefore not the test of choice.",

Although blood cancers often present with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and low body weight (e.g., BMI of 19), the sudden onset of fever, sore throat, tender lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar exudates in this patient indicates an active infection. Additionally, a morbilliform rash (following amoxicillin intake) would not be expected.",

Therapy with ACE inhibitors increases bradykinin serum levels and can cause angioedema due to vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. Unlike angioedema due to mast cell degranulation, bradykinin-mediated angioedema does not cause pruritus or hives. Normal C4 levels in bradykinin-mediated angioedema differentiate this condition from C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, in which C4 levels are decreased. While ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema typically occurs within the first few weeks of treatment initiation, this condition can manifest at any time during the course of treatment, even after years of uncomplicated use. Acquired angioedema is most commonly caused by ACE inhibitors and usually resolves 2–3 weeks after they have been discontinued.",

However, fever in epiglottitis is typically higher and appears with additional features (e.g., sore throat, hoarse or muffled voice, drooling, difficulty swallowing) but not with barking cough. Furthermore, symptoms of epiglottitis usually progress over a span of hours rather than the 2 days seen here. Additionally, this patient's immunizations are up-to-date, which means infection with H. influenzae (the most common cause of epiglottitis) is unlikely.

Because croup is commonly caused by viruses (e.g., parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus), symptomatic relief is sufficient for mild cases. This includes keeping the patient calm and minimizing distress. In addition, all patients with croup should be treated with (oral or parenteral) dexamethasone, which reduces airway swelling within hours. Mild croup can quickly progress to moderate or severe croup, which can compromise the airway and manifest with stridor and dyspnea at rest, subcostal retractions, and cyanosis. Racemic epinephrine is the treatment of choice for severe croup.\n\nHumidified air, both in the hospital and as a home remedy (e.g., steam inhalation), has been used to treat croup, but there is no evidence that it is effective.",

In these patients, hemithyroidectomy allows for definitive diagnosis (via histological analysis showing invasion of the basement membrane) and definitive management with a high probability of cure.

        "explanation_why": "Dislodged otoliths can cause the severe vertigo attacks seen in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). When otoliths become displaced into one of the semicircular ducts, they can disrupt the endolymph and thus lead to stimulation of the hair cells on the cupula. This stimulation sends signals to the brain that suggest motion even if the patient is not moving, thus triggering the sensation of vertigo. Although this patient has vertigo, she also has cochlear symptoms (tinnitus and hearing loss), which are typically absent in BPPV. Additionally, contrary to this patient's presentation, vertigo in BPPV lasts only for a few seconds and is triggered by movement.",

            "description": "The inner ear consists of a bony labyrinth with a membranous labyrinth inside it, separated by a space containing perilymph fluid. It contains the cochlea and vestibular system. The cochlea (on the right) is responsible for the conversion of sound waves into neuronal signals, which are transmitted via the cochlear nerve (depicted by a cartoon DJ). The vestibular system (on the left) consists of three semicircular canals, the saccule, and the utricle. Semicircular canals detect angular acceleration in three planes: the superior or anterior semicircular canal in the sagittal plane, the posterior semicircular canal in the coronal plane, and the lateral or horizontal semicircular canal in the transverse plane. The saccule and utricle contain cells that detect linear motion in the vertical and horizontal planes, respectively. The neuronal signals from the semicircular canals are transmitted via the vestibular nerve (depicted by a dancing cartoon).",

Some patients may present with vertigo (in the case of cerebellar or brainstem involvement), but hearing loss and tinnitus are very rare symptoms. A common first manifestation of MS is impaired vision (due to retrobulbar neuritis), and as the disease progresses other neurological deficits, such as sensory or motor deficits, or fatigue typically appear.",

    "hint": "This patient's initial symptoms (watery nasal discharge, fever, headache, and facial pain) are consistent with acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS). AVRS usually resolves within 7–10 days; however, the development of mucopurulent discharge with a clinical course greater than 10 days is highly suggestive of bacterial superinfection.",

Although diabetes mellitus is a risk factor, there is no indication that his diabetes is poorly controlled, making this diagnosis unlikely. In addition, fungal sinusitis due to Aspergillus is usually accompanied by asthma and other atopic manifestations. A different treatment is more appropriate at this time.",

Mastoiditis usually manifests with persistent or recurrent symptoms of otitis media after initial improvement, profuse ear discharge, a tender and edematous mastoid, and anterolateral protrusion of the auricle. Mastoiditis is a clinical diagnosis but neuroimaging is required in patients with findings suggestive of intracranial complications (e.g., seizures, focal neurological deficits), such as brain abscess. Other indications for imaging are symptoms that do not improve after 48 hours of treatment and planned surgical interventions. MRI of the brain and temporal bone is the preferred imaging modality in children because of the lack of ionizing radiation. In adult patients, a CT scan of the temporal bone is usually the initial imaging study.\n\nMastoiditis is treated with analgesia and empiric intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (e.g., ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam). Myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion are used to facilitate drainage in early infection. Severe or refractory cases require mastoidectomy.",

The mother states that he has been rubbing his left ear repeatedly since he woke up this morning. He has a history of atopic dermatitis and his mother is concerned that the boy's ear pain may result from excessive scratching. She also notes that his latest flareup resolved several days before his birthday party, which he celebrated 1 week ago at a swimming pool. Six months ago, he had an episode of urticaria following antibiotic treatment for pharyngitis. He takes no medications. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg. Otoscopy shows an opaque, bulging tympanic membrane. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

While amoxicillin is the first-line treatment option for AOM, it should be avoided in patients with a history of allergic reactions to penicillin and its derivatives.

He has not had a runny nose or cough. He had a similar problem 1 year ago for which he was prescribed amoxicillin, but after developing a skin rash, facial swelling, and dyspnea he was switched to a different medication. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 75^th percentile for height and the 50^th percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 136/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the oral cavity reveals a bright red tongue with prominent papillae, a red uvula, and an enlarged right tonsil covered by a whitish membrane. The deep cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and tender. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

Moreover, when cephalosporins are used for the treatment of tonsillitis or pharyngitis, 1^st generation cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin, cefadroxil) are preferred; 3^rd generation cephalosporins are least active among all cephalosporins against gram-positive bacteria such as S. pyogenes.",

Targeted antibiotic therapy can be started after the purulent secretion from the duct is collected for Gram-stain and culture.

This disease is caused by bacterial spread from acute tonsillitis into the potential space between the tonsil and the pharyngeal muscles. The diagnosis is usually clinical. Initial treatment typically includes incision and drainage combined with intravenous antibiotic therapy (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam) that provides coverage for Streptococcus pyogenes (most common pathogen), Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes. Patients may be treated with oral antibiotics once they are afebrile.",

He has had a sore throat over the last week that acutely worsened this morning. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He lives at home with his mother. His older brother has asthma. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 38.4°C (101.2°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 93/60 mm Hg. On examination, the patient is drooling from the mouth. The neck is stiff and extension is limited. Respirations appear labored with accessory muscle use. Inspiratory stridor is heard on auscultation of the chest. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Oropharyngeal examination shows a bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall. Intravenous access is obtained and laboratory studies are ordered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The pain is severe, worsens with inspiration, and radiates to his neck. He has had a sore throat and neck pain for the past 4 days. He remained bed-bound during this time and had poor appetite. One week ago, he underwent upper endoscopy for peptic ulcer disease. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. His medications are metformin, omeprazole, pravastatin, and enalapril. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He appears in significant distress. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 88/46 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Oropharyngeal examination is limited because the patient is unable to open his mouth due to pain. His hematocrit is 42%, leukocyte count is 13,800/mm^3, and platelet count is 205,000/mm^3. The patient is intubated in the emergency department and appropriate treatment is started. Chest x-ray shows a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "The patient's history of sore throat, neck pain, and trismus in combination with fever and leukocytosis suggests retropharyngeal abscess, most likely as a complication of tonsillitis or endoscopy. The spread of infection along the deep cervical fascia has likely led to mediastinitis, as indicated by the severe chest pain and widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Additionally, the patient is showing signs of sepsis (hypotension and elevated pulse).",

Retropharyngeal abscess is usually a polymicrobial disease caused by streptococci, staphylococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and/or oral anaerobes, which are all covered by ampicillin-sulbactam. Clindamycin can be used as an alternative to ampicillin-sulbactam. Patients who fail to respond to antibiotic treatment or those with large retropharyngeal abscesses on CT should receive surgical drainage.",

When she turns her head, she sees the light on the ceiling swinging from side to side. She has congestive heart disease, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She was treated for a cerebrovascular accident 7 years ago and has no residual deficits. Current medications include intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin, as well as oral aspirin, atenolol, furosemide, and lisinopril. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur along the left lower sternal border. While the patient fixates on a target, administration of brisk, horizontal head rotations to both sides results in corrective saccades to refixate back to the target. She has an unsteady gait. Muscle strength and sensation are normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?",

Loop diuretics (like furosemide) also increase the risk of ototoxicity by affecting Na^+/K^+/2Cl^- cotransporters present in the inner ear. The vestibular dysfunction of gentamicin toxicity is typically bilateral; accordingly, there is no imbalance between right-sided and left-sided input to the central nervous system, so patients do not typically experience vertigo. However, patients can experience oscillopsia and an abnormal head thrust test in both horizontal directions.\n\nStrategies to reduce adverse effects of aminoglycosides include once-daily dosing and monitoring of serum concentrations.",

He experienced a similar episode 2 months ago, for which he was hospitalized for 10 days. He states that he has never fully recovered from that episode. He felt much better after being treated with antibiotics, but he still coughs often during meals. He sometimes also coughs up undigested food after eating. For the last 5 days, his coughing has become more frequent and productive of yellowish-green sputum. He takes hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and pantoprazole for the retrosternal discomfort that he often experiences while eating. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years and drinks one shot of vodka every day. The patient appears thin. His temperature is 40.1°C (104.2°F), pulse is 118/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mm Hg. Auscultation of the lungs shows right basal crackles.

He reports that he has had recurrent nosebleeds almost daily for the past 3 weeks. The nosebleeds last 30–40 minutes. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. The patient's upper body is elevated and his head tilted forward. The patient's nostrils are pinched for 15 minutes. Despite all measures, the nosebleed continues. Examination of the nose with a speculum does not show an anterior bleeding source. Anterior and posterior nasal packing fails to provide sufficient bleeding control. Endoscopic ligation of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Peripheral facial nerve palsy following facial trauma is caused by temporal bone fracture or trauma. Management typically depends on symptom onset. Acute onset of symptoms following facial trauma is usually caused by nerve injury (e.g., transection); therefore, surgery (e.g., nerve repair) may be indicated. A delayed presentation (e.g., one day after trauma) is most likely secondary to edema within the facial nerve canal. In this patient, corticosteroid therapy is indicated to control swelling within the facial nerve canal. If this patient's facial nerve palsy does not improve or worsens, surgical decompression of the facial nerve canal is indicated.\n\nProper eye care with artificial tears and moisturizing ointments is an important part of managing lagophthalmos.",

Surgical decompression of the facial nerve puts the patient at risk for further injury to an already injured nerve, may prolong or prevent nerve recovery, and carries the risk of additional complications such as hearing loss, vestibular function loss, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and meningitis.",

Although the patient presents with clinical features associated with Bell palsy (e.g. lagophthalmos, flattened nasolabial fold, drooping of a corner of the mouth), his facial palsy is likely the result of his recent trauma. In addition, the patient does not report dermatomal pain or vesicles near the external meatus, which would be expected in herpes zoster.",

However, the patient presented with delayed facial nerve palsy (one day after the traumatic event), which indicates that nerve transection is not the underlying pathology in this patient. Moreover, the CT scan does not show evidence of a transverse fracture of the temporal bone nor is there a penetrating injury near the cheek to suggest facial nerve transection.",

    "hint": "This patient has signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (palpitations, hair loss, and weight loss) with decreased TSH and increased T_3 and T_4 levels. These findings, combined with the presence of a solitary hot nodule on thyroid scintigraphy with suppression of surrounding thyroid tissue, imply that this patient has a toxic adenoma.",

        "explanation_why": "Involution of a follicular adenoma causes a thyroid cyst to form. Thyroid cysts can be painful and cause symptoms secondary to mass effect and compression (e.g., hoarseness, dysphagia). Ultrasound would show a mass filled with fluid, not a solid mass. Additionally, patients with thyroid cysts do not generally present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, nor do they have abnormal thyroid function tests.",

The initial destruction of thyroid tissue can lead to the release of thyroid hormones and subsequent transient hyperthyroidism (hashitoxicosis). However, patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis do not present with solid, solitary thyroid nodules. Additionally, the scintigraphy results are highly suggestive of a toxic adenoma.",

        "explanation_why": "Toxic adenomas arise from a gain-of-function mutation in the TSH receptor gene that causes autonomous functioning of the TSH receptor independent of hypothalamic-pituitary regulation. Without negative feedback, the thyroid follicular cells become hyperplastic and eventually form a toxic adenoma. This autonomous thyroid nodule overproduces thyroid hormones, resulting in hyperthyroidism and a consequent decrease in pituitary TSH secretion. The remainder of the thyroid still responds appropriately to negative feedback, resulting in a suppressed appearance on scintigraphy.",

Though patients with toxic multinodular goiter also present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, they also tend to be older than > 60 years, have multiple nodules, and often have a history of iodine deficiency. In addition, scintigraphy of toxic multinodular goiter shows radioiodine uptake by multiple hyperfunctioning nodules rather than a single nodule as in toxic adenoma.",

There is a 3-cm laceration over the forehead and multiple bruises over the trunk. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The right knee is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun and intravenous acetaminophen is administered. Two hours later, blood-tinged fluid spontaneously drains from both nostrils and is made worse by leaning forward.

Anterior basilar skull fracture can cause cranial nerve (CN) I palsies, as well as palsies in CN V, VI, VII, or VIII. However, CN XII exits the skull at the hypoglossal canal of the occipital bone (in the posterior fossa) and thus is associated with posterior basilar skull fractures, not anterior basilar skull fractures. Additionally, most cranial nerve palsies associated with basilar skull fracture are not present until 1–3 days after injury, because the palsy is the result of compression or contusion of the nerve, which does not occur acutely. If a nerve is transected by trauma (which is uncommon), then the palsy would be present immediately.",

Her 1-year-old brother was treated for viral gastroenteritis 3 weeks ago.  She is at 60^th percentile for height and at 70^th percentile for weight. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg. Examination shows mucopurulent discharge in the left nasal cavity. Oral and otoscopic examination is unremarkable. Endoscopic examination of the nose confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Bilateral choanal atresia usually manifests in infancy, whereas the unilateral form manifests later in life with chronic rhinitis of the affected nasal passage. The timeframe of this patient's symptoms makes bilateral atresia unlikely, however, and unilateral atresia does not typically manifest with foul-smelling or blood-tinged nasal drainage.",

        "explanation_why": "A foreign nasal body should be suspected in any young child with unilateral nasal discharge (most commonly seen in patients 1–5 years of age). The presence of unilateral symptoms can help rule out differential diagnoses, such as chronic rhinosinusitis or upper respiratory tract infection, which generally manifest bilaterally. The foreign object causes local inflammatory reactions, which can lead to foul-smelling nasal discharge, epistaxis, and may progress to secondary infection. Diagnosis is established via direct visualization of the foreign body via anterior rhinoscopy, or, if the foreign body is not visualized on anterior rhinoscopy, flexible fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy. Removal of the foreign body is first attempted through noninvasive techniques (e.g., positive pressure techniques). If unsuccessful, instrumentation techniques (e.g., extraction with forceps) may be necessary.",

She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome. Her current medications include metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the tuning fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the right side and shows a similar pattern. The vibration tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The most common brain tumors in this location are acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas), which usually arise from Schwann cells in the internal auditory meatus and may expand into the cerebellopontine angle. Later symptoms include unilateral facial weakness (due to pressure on CN VII) and unilateral facial pain and/or paresthesia (due to pressure on CN V) as well as gait instability due to vestibular deficits. Further management includes audiometry and cranial MRI with contrast to confirm the tumor. For patients with large tumors or significant hearing loss, the treatment of choice is surgical removal or radiation therapy. For patients with smaller tumors and minimal hearing loss, observation with follow-up may be appropriate.\n\nThe presence of bilateral acoustic neuromas should raise suspicion for neurofibromatosis type II.",

            "description": "Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells and primarily originate within the vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII. The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

Cerumen impaction typically manifests as sudden (e.g., triggered by showering or bathing) rather than progressive hearing loss. Unlike in this woman, the Rinne test would be abnormal (negative) in the affected ear and the Weber test would show a lateralization to the same ear, suggesting conductive rather than sensorineural hearing loss.",

Since the middle ear communicates with the mastoid process, otitis media can result in opacification of these air cells. However, this patient likely has an infection of the external ear, which does not communicate directly with the mastoid process and is therefore not commonly associated with opacified mastoid air cells. The mastoid can be affected if the infection spreads from the temporal bone to adjacent bones, but a different finding is much more likely in malignant otitis externa.",

The specific connection between diabetes mellitus and malignant otitis externa is not fully understood, but may be related to increased pH in diabetic cerumen. Given the strong association between the two conditions, this patient most likely has diabetes. Also, the patient's lack of primary care access puts him at increased risk for the development of chronic diseases, like diabetes mellitus, and their complications.\n\nMalignant otitis externa is a severe infection with significant mortality that is most commonly caused by P. aeruginosa. This patient should undergo imaging studies (CT scan and/or MRI) to identify bone destruction and to determine the extent of intracranial involvement. Following blood cultures, intravenous antibiotic therapy (preferably with two antipseudomonal agents) should be initiated.

    "question_text": "A 12-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of severe ear pain and yellow discharge from her left ear for the past 2 days. It is also mildly pruritic. The pain started during her last day of summer camp, where she spent a lot of time outdoors hiking, horseback riding, and swimming. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Examination shows tragal tenderness and a red and edematous external auditory canal. A diagnostic tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead. The patient reports hearing the sound louder in the left ear. The tuning fork is then placed on the mastoid process of the left ear. Once she can no longer hear the sound, the tuning fork is placed in front of the auricle, and she reports no longer hearing the sound. On the right side, once the sound from the mastoid process subsides and the tuning fork is placed in front of the right ear, she reports hearing the sound again. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

On the right side, once the sound from the mastoid process subsides and the tuning fork is placed in front of the right ear, she reports hearing the sound again. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "hint": "A Weber test that lateralizes to the affected ear (the left ear in this patient) in combination with a negative Rinne test in the same ear suggests conductive hearing loss. Ear pain, otorrhea, pruritus, and an edematous, reddened external auditory canal indicate that the cause of conductive hearing loss is otitis externa.",

        "explanation_why": "Infections of the external ear with Aspergillus or Candida are the most common causes of fungal otitis externa. Fungal infection of the external ear accounts for < 10% of otitis externa cases and is usually associated with concurrent antibiotic use. While patients may present with tragal discomfort and ear discharge, they usually have less severe ear edema, erythema, and pain than with the more common causes of otitis externa. In addition, intense ear itching is usually the primary symptom of fungal otitis externa.",

However, herpes zoster oticus typically manifests with blisters on the external ear, face, and mouth. Patients can present with vertigo, facial paralysis, tinnitus, and dysgeusia (loss of taste). Moreover, herpes zoster oticus is associated with sensorineural hearing loss rather than conductive hearing loss.",

Pharyngeal syphilis usually manifests with papules in the oral cavity that develop into painless ulcers. While early stages are often asymptomatic, some patients may complain of a sore throat. However, infection with T. pallidum in children most commonly occurs via sexual contact or vertical transmission from mother to child (i.e., during pregnancy or at birth) and is therefore unlikely in this 7-year-old boy.",

As in this case, the first manifestations of the disease are usually oropharyngeal lesions and a sore throat. Coxsackie A virus is the most common underlying pathogen, which also causes hand, foot, and mouth disease. The two conditions often occur concomitantly.",

The swelling was initially asymptomatic, but over the past month it has caused some difficulty chewing. She appears well and has no pain. She has not undergone any dental procedures in the past 5 years. She has bronchial asthma. Her only medication is an albuterol inhaler. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a 1.5-cm unilobular, bony hard, nontender mass with a smooth surface located in the midline of the hard palate. There is no cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

After unsuccessful attempts at securing the airway and ventilation via orotracheal intubation, laryngeal mask placement, and bag-mask ventilation, immediate action is required to prevent hypoxia. A surgical airway with cricothyrotomy should be established in patients who cannot be intubated and oxygenated. Cricothyrotomy is the preferred method in an emergency when rapid airway control is needed, especially in cases where intubation is unsuccessful, and other supraglottic airway devices are ineffective.",

        "explanation_why": "Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer measurement is part of the workup for sequelae of streptococcal infection (e.g., rheumatic fever). ASO titer is not useful in diagnosing acute streptococcal infection because antibody levels take about 2 weeks to rise, and do not peak until 3–5 weeks after infection; antibody levels reflect past, rather than current infections. This patient has only been symptomatic for 2 days, therefore an ASO titer would likely be negative, even if his symptoms were due to streptococcal infection.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has acute tonsillitis with no specific signs of viral illness (e.g., conjunctivitis, hoarseness, cough, stomatitis). The gold standard for diagnosing bacterial tonsillitis is a throat culture, which can identify the underlying pathogen and determine its antibiotic sensitivity. The rapid strep antigen test has poor sensitivity but high specificity. Children and adolescents with a negative rapid strep test should have a throat culture to rule out bacterial infection; up to 30% of infections are missed with rapid antigen detection testing. If the rapid strep antigen test is positive, antibiotic therapy can be started without confirmatory throat culture. If bacterial infection is ruled out (i.e., both antigen testing and culture are negative), observation and symptomatic management (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) are indicated.",

This patient will likely need long-term airway management while his laryngeal cancer is managed. Therefore, (percutaneous or open) tracheostomy is the preferred intervention because it will provide an airway that bypasses the tumor and can be used for long-term mechanical ventilation. Although endotracheal intubation would correct this patient's acute respiratory distress, it is not appropriate for long-term airway management (i.e., > 3 weeks), because of the associated risk of complications (e.g., tracheal stenosis, subglottic mass). If this patient were endotracheally intubated, he would eventually need a tracheostomy.",

Furthermore, he will likely need long-term (> 3 weeks) mechanical ventilation given the chronic nature of his airway obstruction and cricothyroidotomy is not indicated for long-term mechanical ventilation.

He reports that the whistling is becoming louder, and is especially loud when he exercises. He says the noise is frustrating for him. Two months ago, the patient underwent outpatient treatment for an uncomplicated nasal fracture after being hit in the nose by a high-velocity stray baseball. Since the accident, the patient has been taking aspirin for pain. He has a history of asymptomatic nasal polyps. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following would have prevented the whistling during respiration?",

        "explanation_why": "Nasal septal perforation may develop as a sequela of septal hematoma secondary to a nasal fracture. The hematoma disrupts blood flow to the septal cartilage, resulting in ischemia, necrosis, and subsequent perforation. Analgesics with antiplatelet activity such as aspirin should be avoided 48 hours after nasal trauma or surgery as they may precipitate the development of septal hematoma. This patient's prolonged pain after nasal injury may also be a sign of complications such as nasal hematoma and perforation. If a nasal septal hematoma is present, aspiration and drainage should be performed immediately to reduce pressure on the cartilage and prevent complications.\n\nWhistling typically resolves with the placement of a silicone button prosthesis.",

Surgical removal of nasal polyps is only indicated if the patient is symptomatic and a trial with topical or systemic glucocorticoids is unsuccessful. Symptomatic nasal polyps typically manifest with a postnasal drip, bilateral nasal obstruction, and frequently hyposmia or anosmia; their presence is not associated with a whistling sound.",

Because muscles responsible for eyelid and forehead movements are innervated by upper motor neuron fibers from both hemispheres, their function is preserved in central facial palsy. In peripheral facial palsy, damage to lower motor neuron (LMN) fibers results in ipsilateral paralysis of all facial muscles. Because sensory and autonomic fibers join the lower motor neuron fibers of the facial nerve in its peripheral course, peripheral facial palsies can also manifest with non-motoric symptoms.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "In addition to bilateral acoustic neuromas, which occur in almost all individuals with NF2 by the age of 30 years, NF2 can cause multiple tumors of the nervous system, such as intracranial and spinal meningiomas, schwannomas of other cranial nerves, and ependymomas. Most meningiomas are slow-growing and patients may therefore be asymptomatic for a prolonged period of time. If symptoms do occur, they usually include general symptoms of CNS tumors (e.g., seizures) or more specific symptoms that are determined by the location of the tumor (e.g., paraparesis and/or uncontrolled micturition if the tumor arises from the falx cerebri). Other typical clinical findings of NF2 include early-onset bilateral cataracts, seizures, skin nodules, and café au lait spots (see “Overview of neurocutaneous syndromes” table).\n\nThe clinical features of acoustic neuromas are caused by compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) as a result of the tumor expanding into the internal acoustic meatus. Sensorineural hearing loss, which is the most common presenting symptom, and tinnitus are due to cochlear nerve involvement, whereas dizziness, unsteady gait, and disequilibrium indicate vestibular nerve involvement.",

This patient reports common triggers to these episodes, including lying down or reclining, and quickly turning her head. The Dix-Hallpike test is used to quickly diagnose BPPV and the Epley maneuver is used to treat BPPV. In refractory cases, patients can undergo surgical obliteration of the affected semicircular canal.",

The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

During this period, he has also had multiple episodes of dizziness and a constant ringing noise in his right ear. Over the past 5 weeks, he has also noticed scant amounts of right-sided ear discharge. He has a history of multiple ear infections since childhood that were treated with antibiotics. Vital signs are within normal limits. Otoscopic examination shows a white pearly mass behind the right tympanic membrane.

The tube allows for the removal of fluid from the middle ear, decreases conductive hearing loss, and helps maintain an air-filled middle ear space.\n\nFollow-ups should continue until the tympanic membrane is fully healed and normal eustachian tube function, as well as normal hearing, are achieved. Possible complications include otorrhea, occlusion of tubes, premature extrusion of tubes, persistent perforation, tympanosclerosis, and cholesteatoma.",

An operating microscope is preferred, although the procedure can be performed using a handheld operating otoscope.1. A radial incision is made in the anterior-inferior quadrant of the pars tensa using a myringotomy blade.\n2. Alligator forceps are used to insert the tympanostomy tube. Short-term tubes (I) are designed to self-extrude after approximately one year, whereas long-term tubes (II) have a longer flange that prevents extrusion.\n3. A curved or angled pick can be used to facilitate correct placement.",

HHT is commonly associated with gastrointestinal telangiectasias but only rarely with gastrointestinal polyps (a subtype of HHT is associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome). A different complication of HHT is much more common.",

        "explanation_why": "HHT is not associated with an increased risk of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are seen in patients with multiple hereditary disorders, including multiple endocrine neoplasias types 2A and 2B (MEN 2A, MEN 2B), von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). None of these conditions are associated with mucocutaneous telangiectasis. VHL is associated with mucocutaneous cavernous hemangiomas and hemangioblastomas of the retina or CNS. The cutaneous findings of NF1 are cutaneous neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules. Patients with MEN 2B present with oral/intestinal neuromas and marfanoid habitus.",

NRDS is typically seen in premature infants due to impaired synthesis and secretion of surfactant. Affected newborns have tachypnea, expiratory grunting, and cyanosis immediately following birth. However, auscultation of the lungs in newborns with NRDS shows decreased breath sounds, and breathing would not normalize after crying.",

In addition to persistent mild cyanosis, patients with TOF may develop recurrent episodes of cyanosis and hypoxia during feeding and crying. However, these tet spells are more common between the ages of 2 and 4 months rather than immediately following birth. In addition, this patient's cyanosis worsens with feeding rather than during a physiologic stressor and improves with crying, which is unlikely in patients with TOF.",

Patients with this condition have complete blockage of both nasal cavities and, therefore, are only able to breathe through their mouths, which results in cyanosis when the mouth is blocked during feeding. The inability to pass a catheter through the nasal cavities supports the presumptive diagnosis of choanal atresia. Confirmatory testing by CT scan or contrast rhinography in the supine position should follow. Unilateral choanal atresia is twice as prevalent as its bilateral counterpart.

Other characteristic features of the condition include poor wound healing with large skin ulcers, omphalitis, and severe periodontitis/gingivitis. A very high neutrophil count (as high as 100,000/mm^3 during active infection) is seen as neutrophil activation and recruitment of neutrophils occurs, but neutrophils are unable to extravasate into tissues, causing pooling within the circulation.",

Type IV collagen is found in the glomerular basement membrane, the cochlea, and the lens of the eye. Thus, a defect of type IV collagen may result in hematuria and nephritic syndrome, sensorineural hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus leading to vision problems (patients with Alport syndrome “can't pee, can't see, can't hear a bee”).\n\nThe diagnosis of Alport syndrome is confirmed via skin biopsy (showing the absence of type IV collagen alpha-5 chains in the basement membrane) or, if skin biopsy is inconclusive, kidney biopsy. Patients with proteinuria, such as this boy, should receive ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers to slow the progression to end-stage renal disease.",

However, ARPKD does not account for sensorineural deafness and lenticonus. Instead, patients with ARPKD who survive to adolescence usually have evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, splenomegaly).\n\nIn about 15% of cases, Alport syndrome may be the result of an autosomal-recessive mutation.

Between these episodes, patients typically have asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, such as microhematuria. The most likely explanation for these findings is an increased number of defective circulating IgA antibodies, the synthesis of which is triggered by mucosal infections (e.g., pharyngitis). These IgA antibodies form immune complexes that deposit in the mesangium of the renal glomerulus, leading to glomerulonephritis (type III hypersensitivity reaction).\n\nThe treatment of IgA nephropathy includes monitoring of kidney function and initiation of treatment if the disease progresses (e.g., ACE inhibitors for hypertension and/or proteinuria). Immunosuppressive therapy may be indicated in more severe cases. Even with the appropriate treatment, up to 50% of the patients progress to end-stage renal disease within 20–25 years.

        "explanation_why": "Granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 complement are typically seen on immunofluorescent microscopy of a kidney biopsy sample in patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN can manifest with gross hematuria following an episode of pharyngitis. However, PSGN usually manifests 1–3 weeks after an acute infection. Furthermore, this diagnosis is most common in young children and older individuals and is uncommon in adolescents. In addition, it does not result in recurrent episodes of hematuria. Moreover, this patient does not have other typical findings of PSGN, such as hypertension and edema.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has features consistent with congenital hypothyroidism (poor feeding and lethargy, a raspy/hoarse cry, prolonged newborn jaundice, umbilical hernia, increased head circumference, muscle hypotonia, macroglossia). The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions is thyroid dysgenesis (i.e., thyroid hypoplasia, dysplasia, or aplasia). Early initiation of thyroxine supplementation is essential to prevent the patient from developing permanent intellectual disability. If the mother has clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism, the manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism may be apparent at birth; if the mother is euthyroid, the manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism develop a few weeks to months after birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone. Therefore, neonatal screening for thyroid deficiency is indicated even if the neonate is asymptomatic; screening is mandatory in the US and typically performed by measuring TSH levels 24–48 hours after birth.",

    "hint": "Ear pain, often suggested by excessive crying and ear tugging, in combination with irritability, fever, and a recent upper respiratory infection (URI) is the classic presentation of acute otitis media (AOM) in infants.

        "explanation_why": "Otoscopic examination in AOM typically shows a bulging erythematous tympanic membrane (TM) due to the accumulation of purulent secretions in the middle ear. Other common findings include TM opacification and loss of light reflex. AOM may cause rupture of the TM, which leads to purulent or serosanguinous otorrhea.\n\nIn otherwise healthy children aged > 6 months with uncomplicated, unilateral AOM, as seen here, pain relief and observation are the mainstays of treatment. Systemic antibiotic treatment should be considered if symptoms do not improve within 48–72 hours.",

These rare, benign, but rapidly expanding tumors occur exclusively in boys and manifest with a mass arising from the roof of the nasopharynx on a cranial CT scan. JNAs typically show strong contrast enhancement on CT scan due to their increased vascularity, which is the cause for recurrent epistaxis. The tumors also induce pressure necrosis on adjacent structures (e.g., the orbits, the intracranial cavity). Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for symptomatic JNAs, because they are locally aggressive and have a high recurrence rate. Radiosurgery (i.e., with a stereotactic gamma knife) is reserved for recurrent JNAs and/or JNAs with intracranial extension.",

His prolonged nasal congestion suggests allergic rhinitis, which would complete the atopic triad. Spirometry is the initial test of choice in patients with suspected asthma ≥ 6 years of age. The presence of an obstructive lung pattern (↓ FEV_1, ↓ FEV1/FVC ratio) that reverses with bronchodilation confirms a diagnosis. Spirometry may be attempted in children < 6 years of age, but results are often unreliable. Therefore, diagnosis is largely dependent on a detailed history and the response to a trial of asthma medication. If the diagnosis is still nonconclusive, a methacholine challenge test may be attempted.",

As a child, he was consistently in the 60^th percentile for height; now he is in the 25^th percentile. He has a normal diet but says that “food often has no taste”. His classmates make fun of his short stature and high-pitched voice. As an infant, he had bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism and a cleft palate repair. He is otherwise healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical exam, axillary and pubic hair is sparse. His genital development is at Tanner stage 1. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Treatment consists of hormone replacement therapy during puberty and gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH for the management of infertility in adults.",

The surgical course was uncomplicated, and the patient was successfully extubated before arrival to the unit. He received 0.5 L of lactated Ringer solution intraoperatively. The patient was given morphine and ketorolac for postoperative pain. A similar episode happened 6 months ago when the patient took aspirin for a headache; symptoms resolved spontaneously within 3 hours. He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, and hypertension. His daily medications include metoprolol and lisinopril. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen by face mask shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Wheezing is heard in both lungs. Breath sounds are decreased. The patient's face appears flushed. Watery nasal secretions and conjunctival injection are present. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

However, metoprolol is a beta-blocker that selectively inhibits β_1 receptors. It is therefore not the most likely cause of bronchospasm in this patient.\n\nAll beta-blockers can trigger bronchospasms in patients with asthma and β1-receptor selectivity is diminished in higher doses. Therefore, beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with severe or decompensated asthma. However, therapeutic doses of cardioselective beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) are generally well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate asthma.",

Alveolar rupture would result in a pneumothorax, which presents with dyspnea and decreased breath sounds on the side of the pneumothorax. This patient developed wheezing and decreased breath sounds bilaterally after an infusion of ketorolac, making alveolar rupture unlikely.",

Patients with AERD develop symptoms resembling those of a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., wheezing, decreased breath sounds, facial flushing) following the administration of aspirin or NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac). Watery rhinorrhea and conjunctival injection are also commonly seen in AERD. Unlike a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is an IgE-mediated process, AERD is a pseudoallergic reaction caused by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Inhibition of the COX pathway increases the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes via the lipoxygenases pathway. Leukotrienes cause flushing and bronchial inflammation.",

Arterial blood gas analysis will show findings similar to what is seen in this patient: decreased pO_2 and daytime hypercapnia due to air trapping as a result of expiratory collapse of small airways. However, chest x-ray would likely show signs of hyperinflation (e.g., horizontal ribs and widened intercostal spaces, increased anteroposterior diameter, flattened diaphragm).

Metabolic compensation (elevated HCO_3^-) is usually also present and indicates that the hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis is chronic. Obesity reduces inspiratory muscle strength and restricts respiratory excursions, resulting in alveolar hypoventilation. Moreover, obesity is associated with increased production of CO_2 as a result of the larger body surface area, further contributing to hypercapnia. OHS can be diagnosed in patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2 with symptoms similar to OSA (excessive daytime sleepiness, restless sleep, snoring with apneic episodes) and evidence of daytime alveolar hypoventilation on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis that cannot be otherwise explained.\n\n90% of patients with OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and distinguishing the two conditions can be challenging because the risk factors and symptoms are very similar. The main difference between the two conditions is that the ABG abnormalities are diurnal in OHS and nocturnal in OSA.",

The headaches are worse when he wakes up and are not accompanied by other symptoms. The patient also reports trouble concentrating on daily tasks at his office job. His wife recently started sleeping in their guest bedroom because “I just couldn't take it anymore. His sinusitis has been acting up at night and I was not able to catch any sleep.” The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic sinusitis, and an allergy to dust mites. Medications include enalapril, bisoprolol, and atorvastatin. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years. His pulse is 72/min and blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 120 kg (265 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m^2. Neurologic examination is normal. Cardiac examination shows a normal S_1 and S_2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His skin is warm and well perfused. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hypertension?",

Typical features of this disease include nocturnal snoring, morning headaches, poor concentration, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and depression. Nocturnal apneic episodes in individuals with OSA result in nocturnal hypercapnia, which, in turn, causes an increased sympathetic response that leads to secondary hypertension. Obesity, especially around the neck, is the most important risk factor for developing OSA, and weight loss will often improve symptoms.",

            "description": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder and is typically associated with obesity, especially around the neck (short, wide “bull neck”). The relaxation and collapse of the pharyngeal muscles (e.g., tongue, uvula, soft palate) during sleep results in the obstruction of the upper airways. This obstruction causes multiple episodes of interrupted breathing (apnea and hypopnea events) as well as irregular snoring (due to soft-tissue vibrations caused by the obstructed airflow during respiration), gasping, or choking episodes.",

However, pituitary adenomas usually cause visual field defects (e.g., bitemporal hemianopsia), which are not reported on neurological examination. In addition, hyperpigmentation and cutaneous features of Cushing syndrome (e,g., thin skin, striae, buffalo hump) would be expected in patients with Cushing disease.",

She also reports pain in her left cheek when eating and pain during sexual intercourse for the past week. She has not been sick for the past 6 months. She has started hiking in the woods on the weekends with her son a couple of months ago but has been careful to avoid poison ivy. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. She recently started taking captopril and stopped taking meloxicam 2 weeks ago. She has a family history of pernicious anemia and Graves disease. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows multiple, flaccid blisters over the volar surface of the forearm and ulcers on the buccal, gingival, and vulvar mucosa. The epidermis on the forearm separates when the skin is lightly stroked. The total body surface area involvement of the blisters is estimated to be 10%. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Lichen planus typically affects patients 30–60 years of age and may manifest with lesions on the skin as well as the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and/or genitalia. Antihypertensive drugs have been known to trigger lichen planus-like eruptions. However, lichen planus usually manifests as firm, shiny, reddish-purple, polygonal papules that are intensely pruritic, and the enanthem would typically appear as white streaks forming a lace-like network (Wickham striae) or fixed white plaques. Blister formation is not usually seen in patients with lichen planus.",

Thiol-containing drugs (e.g., captopril, penicillamine) and phenol-containing drugs (e.g., cephalosporins, rifampicin, phenobarbital, aspirin) can induce the formation of these autoantibodies. Since desmosomal adhesion proteins enable keratinocyte adherence, damage to these proteins causes intraepidermal bullae formation and a positive Nikolsky sign. The lesions typically occur first on mucous membranes and can become confluent or erode to form painful ulcers. PV is treated with high-dose systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., azathioprine, IVIG, rituximab). Severe PV can be fatal, as it can lead to bacterial superinfection, fluid loss, and/or electrolyte imbalance.\n\nSee “Overview of blistering diseases” table.",

However, CLL is associated with further features, such as lymphocytosis, a history of recurrent infections (e.g., necrotic erysipelas, candidiasis, and/or herpes zoster), and polyclonal gammopathy (i.e., broad-based peak representing a polyclonal increase in immunoglobulins) rather than monoclonal gammopathy (i.e., single spike of monoclonal IgM immunoglobulin).",

In addition, the CRAB symptoms (hypercalcemia, renal disease, anemia, and bone lesions) are classically present to varying degrees. This patient is normocalcemic with adequate renal function and has not reported any bone pain, making MM a less likely diagnosis.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is an indolent type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is caused by abnormal production of IgM antibodies by monoclonal plasma cells. This condition usually manifests in older patients with impaired platelet function (nosebleeds), anemia, and mild thrombocytopenia, progressive neuropathy (history of pain and numbness in the feet, muscle weakness), and hyperviscosity syndrome (vision and hearing loss). Lymph node enlargement, as well as increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase can also be present. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrating a dense, monoclonal IgM band is essential for diagnosis. Treatment includes administration of CD20 antibodies (e.g., rituximab) and plasmapheresis in case of hyperviscosity syndrome.\n\nHyperviscosity syndrome is present in about 30% of patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. This condition is not caused by an increase in hematocrit but rather from the clumping effects induced by the pathologically elevated serum IgM concentrations (i.e., IgM act as cold agglutinins).",

While leukoplakia is by itself a benign lesion, it predisposes to squamous cell carcinoma. Up to 30% of leukoplakia lesions progress to carcinoma depending on appearance, demography, and follow-up time. Because of this, it is important to biopsy leukoplakia lesions to check for signs of dysplasia.\n\nTreatment consists of smoking cessation, cryotherapy, laser ablation, or surgical excision if the lesion persists.",

    "hint": "This patient has the classic triad of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA): necrotizing vasculitis (palpable purpura), upper/lower respiratory tract manifestations (chronic sinusitis, nasal ulcers, hemoptysis, and pleuritis), and glomerulonephritis (elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, and hematuria with red blood cell casts).",

        "explanation_why": "Increased c-ANCA titers are present in approximately 90% of patients with active GPA and 60–70% of patients with inactive disease, due to antibodies against proteinase-3. A biopsy of affected tissue (e.g., nasopharynx) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis, which would show necrotic, partially granulomatous vasculitis.\n\nInspiratory stridor in this patient should be urgently evaluated because it could be the result of a severe case of subglottic stenosis, the most common tracheobronchial manifestation of GPA. Over time, nasal cartilage destruction can lead to saddle nose deformity.",

        "explanation_why": "Serum IgA titers may be increased in patients with IgA vasculitis, which can manifest with fever (prodromal), palpable purpura, nephritic syndrome, and, rarely, hemoptysis. However, IgA vasculitis typically occurs in children, and features such as pleuritic chest pain, ulceration of nasopharyngeal mucosa, septal perforation/deformities, recurrent sinusitis, and multiple cavitating, nodular lesions on a chest x-ray would not be seen.

        "explanation_why": "p-ANCA titers are increased in less than 10% of patients with GPA. Instead, p-ANCA titers are commonly elevated in patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), which can manifest with involvement of the lungs (hemoptysis due to pulmonary vasculitis), the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), and the skin (palpable purpura). However, involvement of the nasopharynx (septal perforation, sinusitis, ulceration) is much more common in GPA (90%) than in MPA (35%). Although MPA cannot be entirely excluded in this patient without histopathologic examination, the extensive upper respiratory tract involvement makes GPA the more likely diagnosis.\n\nIncreased levels of p-ANCA are also commonly seen in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which can manifest with fever, hemoptysis, hematuria, and chronic rhinosinusitis (allergic). However, septal perforation is rare, and features such as pleuritic chest pain, ulceration of the nasal mucosa, and nodular cavitating lesions on chest x-ray would not be seen. Instead, patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis typically present with a history of bronchial asthma, multifocal mononeuropathy, and/or evidence of eosinophilia.",

A history of working in a wire-mesh factory would have been a risk factor for asbestosis before the ban of spray-on asbestos products, but no longer today. Moreover, symptoms of asbestosis have a chronic onset and usually develop 10–15 years after continuous exposure to asbestos. This patient has had a hyperacute onset of respiratory symptoms and only recently started work at a wire-mesh factory. Furthermore, nephritic syndrome, palpable purpura, nasopharyngeal ulceration, and septal deformities/perforation are not expected in patients with asbestosis.",

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes. Chest x-ray in reactivation TB typically shows multiple cavities in the upper lobes, calcifications, patchy consolidations, and features fibroproliferative disease (e.g, scarring) due to inflammatory tissue destruction.",

Hearing loss in patients with Meniere disease is usually episodic; it typically begins before and during the attack of dizziness and abates afterward.

About 25% of patients with otosclerosis also report mild vertigo (often described by patients as “dizziness”). Patients with otosclerosis are commonly able to hear better in noisy rather than quiet surroundings (paracusis of Willis) and characteristically develop a soft, monotonous speech. Occasionally, a reddish hue can be seen through the tympanic membrane (Schwartze sign) reflecting an active otosclerotic focus.\n\nTreatment of otosclerosis consists of surgical replacement of the stapes with a prosthesis (stapedotomy or stapedectomy). A cochlear implant may be indicated in advanced cases.",

            "description": "Audiogram of a patient with otosclerosis in the right ear.Air conduction is reduced in the affected ear by approx. 35dB. Bone conduction shows a characteristic notched hearing loss at 2000Hz (Carhart notch). These are characteristic findings of otosclerosis, a condition that causes conductive hearing loss due to the fixation of the stapes to the oval window.",

She reports that she sometimes has a feeling of “food getting stuck” in her throat and hears a “gurgling sound” from her throat while eating. She says that she occasionally coughs up pieces of undigested food. She has noticed a bad taste in her mouth and bad breath. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has been visiting Mexico every year for the past 7 years. She has Raynaud disease treated with nifedipine. Her father died because of gastric cancer. She smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but stopped 25 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9800/mm^3, and platelet count is 215,000/mm^3. ECG shows sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

The best confirmatory test in patients with ZD is barium esophagram with dynamic continuous fluoroscopy. The characteristic outpouching in the posterior pharyngoesophageal wall confirms the diagnosis.\n\nPatients presenting with symptomatic ZD should undergo open surgical or endoscopic treatment.",

Esophageal manometry is also useful for detecting esophageal involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc), which often manifests with Raynaud disease, as seen here.

Also, a CT scan of the neck and chest would not be the confirmatory test in the diagnosis of esophageal cancers.

This patient's visits to Mexico, which is endemic for Chagas disease, increase her risk for this condition. However, megaesophagus typically occurs in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (approx. after 10–20 years), which is inconsistent with her travel history. Moreover, the chronic phase of Chagas disease would usually manifest with other symptoms including arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy (ECG shows no abnormalities) and/or abdominal complaints due to involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, neither of which is the case here.",

He has difficulties understanding conversations in crowded places and when more than one person talks at the same time. He has no dizziness, ear discharge, ringing noise, or ear pain. He has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Otoscopic examination shows pearly gray, translucent tympanic membranes with a normal light reflex. A vibrating 512 Hz tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Once the patient no longer hears a tone, the fork is held over the ipsilateral ear and the patient reports hearing the tone again. The same test is repeated on the right side with similar results. There is no lateralization when a vibrating 512 Hz tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

During this time he has not been able to eat more than one bite without coughing immediately and sometimes he regurgitates food through his nose. His symptoms are worse with liquids. One month ago he had a stroke in the right middle cerebral artery. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include aspirin, amlodipine, metformin, and simvastatin. Examination of the oropharynx, chest, and abdomen shows no abnormalities. Neurological examination shows facial drooping on the left and decreased strength in the left upper and lower extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

It involves direct visualization of the entire swallowing process using continuous x-rays and barium contrast. This diagnostic test evaluates the patient's risk of aspiration and determines whether the patient might benefit from supervised feedings, swallow rehabilitation therapy, and/or enteral nutrition.",

Barium swallow is indicated in patients with esophageal dysphagia, most commonly after an upper endoscopy is unrevealing. This patient presents with oropharyngeal, rather than esophageal, dysphagia.

Lifestyle modifications such as stress reduction, a low-sodium diet, and identification and avoidance of triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, nicotine) are part of the initial nonpharmacological treatment for this condition. Further treatment options include vestibular rehabilitation therapy as well as chronic pharmacotherapy (e.g., diuretics) for patients with frequently recurring episodes. Interventional therapy (e.g., chemical vestibular ablation with intratympanic gentamicin, intratympanic steroids) and surgical vestibular ablation (e.g., labyrinthectomy, vestibular neurectomy) are reserved for patients with intractable symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life.\n\nAcute episodes of Meniere disease can be treated with vestibular suppressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, first-generation antihistamines).",

The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

    "hint": "Chronic rhinorrhea and nasal congestion in association with a known trigger (strong odor) without symptoms of allergic rhinitis (e.g., sneezing, itchy eyes/nose) strongly suggest vasomotor rhinitis, a type of nonallergic rhinitis. The symptoms are often worse during the winter months (due to the cold, dry air).",

        "explanation_why": "A radioallergosorbent test (RAST) can be used to identify allergen-specific IgE in patients with allergic rhinitis who do not respond to empirical therapy and if cutaneous testing is unavailable or inconvenient. Allergic rhinitis can manifest with persistent rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. However, patients with allergic rhinitis typically present with prominent ocular symptoms (itchy, and watery eyes), sneezing, and an itchy nose and throat. Moreover, symptoms are typically worse in springtime and examination would show normal or pale greyish nasal mucosa. In contrast, vasomotor rhinitis is not the result of an IgE-mediated process; performing allergy testing is therefore not necessary at this point.",

This patient should receive adequate first-line treatment before adding adjunctive therapies.

This patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with vasomotor rhinitis, which does not respond to treatment with oral antihistamines.",

        "explanation_why": "Topical antihistamines, such as intranasal azelastine, are a first-line treatment option for vasomotor rhinitis (VR). In addition to blocking H_1 histamine receptors, azelastine also stabilizes mast cells, prevents eosinophil activation, and inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production, thereby relieving the symptoms of rhinorrhea and nasal congestion of VR. This patient should also be encouraged to avoid known triggers of VR, which include certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs) and strong odors (e.g., perfume). Intranasal glucocorticoids (e.g., fluticasone) are further first-line treatment options for VR. Saline nasal irrigation and nasal decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline) may be added as adjunctive therapies.",

During this time, he noticed increased mouth breathing and his wife told him that he started snoring. He has also had several episodes of a dry cough that have kept him awake at night. One year ago, he had an asthma exacerbation while being treated for an ankle sprain. Two weeks ago, he had another asthma exacerbation after taking ibuprofen for his headaches. Current medications are a combined budesonide-formoterol inhaler and an over-the-counter nasal decongestant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows mild tenderness over the forehead bilaterally. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

Patients with nasal polyps typically present with symptoms of postnasal drip (e.g., dry cough when lying supine) and nasal obstruction (e.g., mouth breathing, new-onset snoring). Diagnosis is confirmed by nasal endoscopy; in cases of unilateral nasal polyps, a biopsy is performed to exclude malignancy. A CT scan can be performed to exclude other causes of nasal obstruction. Nasal polyps can also be seen in individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis, even in the absence of asthma or aspirin sensitivity.\n\nIntranasal corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for nasal polyposis. In patients who do not respond to topical steroids, other treatments might be indicated (e.g., systemic steroids, monoclonal antibodies, surgery). Aspirin desensitization may also be performed in patients with AERD.",

To open her eyes, the patient must contract the frontalis muscle, resulting in the forehead wrinkles seen in image B. Both eyes deviate outwards (exotropia) and downwards (hypotropia) from the primary gaze position. This occurs due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, which are the only unaffected extraocular muscles. Mydriasis indicates involvement of the parasympathetic portion of the oculomotor nerve.Ptosis, mydriasis, exotropia, and hypotropia are the classic signs of complete oculomotor palsy. Complete oculomotor palsy is more commonly unilateral than bilateral.",

        "explanation_why": "Type IV collagen, which forms a component of basement membranes, plays an important role in the function of glomeruli and inner ear structures (particularly the organ of Corti). An X-linked defect in type IV collagen is responsible for most cases of Alport's syndrome, which results in progressive sensorineural hearing loss (with high-frequency sounds affected first) and hematuria. Episodes of gross hematuria are sometimes preceded by upper respiratory tract infections. Patients with Alport's syndrome also commonly develop an anterior lenticonus since type IV collagen is the predominant collagen fiber in the lens capsule. A family history of renal disease among males is common in patients with Alport's syndrome.",

Hematuria, hypertension, anemia, and raised creatinine in a 10-year-old child with an onset of symptoms during infancy and a positive family history might suggest a diagnosis of ARPKD. However, ARPKD does not account for sensorineural deafness. Instead, patients with ARPKD who survive to adolescence usually have evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, splenomegaly).",

Next, the physician holds the tuning fork against the bridge of her forehead, to which the patient responds she hears the sound better on the right side than the left. The patient's examination findings are most consistent with which of the following conditions?",

The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

The cyst can develop anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct and manifests as a painless, firm, midline mass of the anterior neck. Like the thyroid gland, the thyroglossal cyst is enclosed within the pretracheal fascia, which is responsible for the upward movement of these structures during swallowing. In addition, a thyroglossal cyst moves upward with tongue protrusion because the fibrous remnants of the thyroglossal duct are connected to the base of the tongue.",

            "description": "Flow cytometry is a technique for the identification, quantification, and sorting of single cells in a cell suspension, often with the use of fluorescent-tagged antibodies to detect the presence of specific target antigens (as illustrated here).Inside the nozzle, a fluid (sheath fluid) focuses the cells into a narrow stream, causing them to pass across the laser beam in single file. As the laser hits each cell, the light scattered varies in accordance with its size, shape, and intracellular and cell surface molecules. Cells containing the target antigen also have the fluorescent-tagged antibody bound to them, which emits light of a specific wavelength when activated by the laser beam (yellow and blue, in this image).\nA detector directly opposite the laser beam measures the amount of forward scatter, and detectors placed perpendicular to the laser beam measure side scatter and fluorescence.The collected data can then be plotted as a histogram (yellow graph and blue graph) or a scatter plot (bottom right graph). Histograms measure a single parameter, displaying a large number of events (cells) as a spike. Scatter plots measure two parameters simultaneously, representing each event (cell) as a single point and clustering events with similar fluorescence intensities. In the case illustrated, the gray cells do not possess the target antigens and are marked as events at low fluorescence intensity on both axes in the scatter plot. By contrast, green cells possess two target antigens and are represented as high fluorescence intensity events on both axes.",

The atypical lymphocytes on this patient's peripheral blood smear are reactive CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The diagnosis of IM is typically clinical but EBV serology is the most reliable laboratory study. Anti-VCA IgM antibodies alone are sufficient to diagnose acute infection. A positive heterophile agglutination test (monospot test) can support the diagnosis but carries a high risk of false positive and false negative results and is therefore not the test of choice. Although IM itself does not usually cause a rash, a morbilliform rash commonly occurs in patients with this condition who are mistakenly administered an aminopenicillin with the intent of treating a bacterial infection (e.g., streptococcal pharyngitis, which also manifests with fever, sore throat, and cervical lymphadenopathy).",

However, involvement of the nasopharynx (septal perforation, sinusitis, ulceration) is much more common in GPA (90%) than in MPA (35%).

        "explanation_why": "Fever, painful swallowing, excessive drooling, a muffled voice, and tender cervical lymphadenopathy suggest epiglottitis. The introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in 1985 led to an overall decrease in the incidence of epiglottitis, primarily by reducing the rate of Hib infection in children. The incidence of Hib epiglottitis in unvaccinated adults has not significantly changed since the introduction of the vaccine. Now, epiglottitis is more common in adults than in children and is most commonly caused by S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, or S. aureus. However, Hib remains a significant causal pathogen, especially in unvaccinated individuals.",

Unlike this patient's presentation, symptoms usually progress gradually, beginning with low-grade fever, headache, and malaise, before leading to lymphadenopathy and tonsillopharyngitis.

Hyperplastic candidiasis lesions cannot be scraped off, but they typically appear near the labial commissure, unlike the gingival lesions in this patient. Moreover, a biopsy of oral candidiasis lesions would show hyphal structures and an infiltrate of inflammatory cells.",

When otoliths become displaced into one of the semicircular ducts, they can disrupt the endolymph and thus lead to stimulation of the hair cells on the cupula. This stimulation sends signals to the brain that suggest motion even if the patient is not moving, thus triggering the sensation of vertigo. Although this patient has vertigo, he also has cochlear symptoms (tinnitus and hearing loss), which are typically absent in patients with BPPV. In addition, contrary to this patient's presentation, vertigo in BPPV lasts only for a few seconds and is triggered by movement.",

It contains the cochlea and vestibular system. The cochlea (on the right) is responsible for the conversion of sound waves into neuronal signals, which are transmitted via the cochlear nerve (depicted by a cartoon DJ). The vestibular system (on the left) consists of three semicircular canals, the saccule, and the utricle. Semicircular canals detect angular acceleration in three planes: the superior or anterior semicircular canal in the sagittal plane, the posterior semicircular canal in the coronal plane, and the lateral or horizontal semicircular canal in the transverse plane. The saccule and utricle contain cells that detect linear motion in the vertical and horizontal planes, respectively. The neuronal signals from the semicircular canals are transmitted via the vestibular nerve (depicted by a dancing cartoon).",

Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

Other risk factors for mucocutaneous candidiasis are uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, inhalation of corticosteroids, antibiotic use, and neonatal age group (Candida infection acquired during vaginal delivery). Mild oral thrush can be treated topically with nystatin (“swish and swallow”). The odynophagia seen in this patient could suggest involvement of the esophagus (candidal esophagitis). Severe thrush or candidal esophagitis will require systemic therapy with fluconazole or echinocandins.",

        "explanation_why": "Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disorder caused by autoantibodies against desmosomal adhesion proteins, including desmoglein 3 and desmoglein 1. Certain medications, such as captopril, glyburide, thiol-containing drugs (e.g., penicillamine), and phenol-containing drugs (e.g., cephalosporins, rifampicin, phenobarbital, aspirin), can induce the formation of these autoantibodies. Since desmosomal adhesion proteins enable keratinocyte adherence, damage to these proteins causes intraepidermal bullae formation and a positive Nikolsky sign. The lesions typically occur first on mucous membranes and can become confluent or erode to form painful ulcers.\n\nPemphigus vulgaris is treated with high-dose systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., azathioprine, IVIG, rituximab). Severe pemphigus vulgaris can be fatal, as it can lead to bacterial superinfection, fluid loss, and/or electrolyte imbalance.",

Affected individuals may also develop pharyngitis and conjunctivitis, which would be consistent with this patient's presentation.

        "explanation_why": "In ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), aberrant epigenetic expression of proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) occurs on the membranes of neutrophils. Autoantibodies formed against these proteins (PR3-ANCA, MPO-ANCA) activate neutrophils, which release inflammatory mediators resulting in damage to endothelial cells of small blood vessels. The clinical phenotype of AAV is closely correlated with the type of ANCA. GPA, which this patient most likely has, is predominantly associated with PR3-ANCA production, while eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are predominantly associated with MPO-ANCA production. Unlike non-ANCA small-vessel vasculitis (e.g., cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura) which are caused primarily by immune complex deposition, the vessel walls of patients with AAV have a paucity of immune complexes (“pauci-immune” vasculitis).\n\nApart from the typical presentation of upper respiratory tract symptoms, this patient's easily bleeding gingival hyperplasia is a unique feature of GPA, called strawberry gingivitis.",

In cardiomyocytes, the defective potassium channels cause prolongation of the ventricular action potential, which can lead to dizziness, syncope, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death. In the inner ear, the defect disrupts the production of endolymph, resulting in congenital sensorineural deafness.\n\nAnother congenital LQTS with a pure cardiac phenotype is Romano-Ward syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition.",

Patients with AERD develop symptoms resembling those of a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., wheezing, decreased breath sounds, facial flushing) following the administration of aspirin or NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac). Watery rhinorrhea and conjunctival injection are also commonly seen in AERD. Unlike a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is an IgE-mediated process, AERD is a pseudoallergic reaction caused by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Inhibition of the COX pathway increases the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes via the lipoxygenases pathway. Leukotrienes cause cutaneous flushing and bronchial inflammation.",

He has also felt depressed, and he noticed that he regularly thinks back to his time in the military. The patient retired from the military 1 month ago when he returned from a deployment to Syria where he was involved in active combat. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. His vital signs are within normal limits. Otoscopic examination shows a clear translucent tympanic membrane with a normal light reflex. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the right mastoid process. Immediately after the patient stops hearing a tone, the tuning fork is held over the right ear and he reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the left side and shows the same pattern. The vibrating tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound in the center of his head. The results of an audiogram are shown. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's impaired hearing?",

Moreover, patients with otosclerosis hear better in crowded environments (paracusis willisii) and have a characteristic notched hearing loss at 2 kHz (Carhart notch) on an audiogram unlike this patient who has difficulty hearing in crowded places and a notch at 3–4 kHz. Additionally, otoscopic examination in patients with active otosclerosis would usually reveal a red-blue hue seen through the tympanic membrane (Schwartze sign) as opposed to a clear, translucent tympanic membrane with a normal light reflex.",

More commonly, barotrauma manifests with conductive hearing loss, which would show a different pattern on tuning fork tests and audiogram.

Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by irreversible damage to the stereocilia of the hair cells in the organ of Corti. Deployed military personnel, like this patient, have a high occupational risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss. Such hearing loss is slowly progressive and affects high frequencies (3–4 kHz) first, which results in difficulty hearing in crowded environments. Tinnitus is often an associated symptom. There is no definitive treatment available (besides hearing aids); therefore, prevention with appropriate hearing protection is essential. In addition to sensorineural hearing loss, exposure to sudden noise louder than 120 dB can cause conductive hearing loss through rupture of the tympanic membrane.\n\nHearing loss is a risk factor for depressive disorders, which are common among veterans.",

Furthermore, otoscopy of a cerumen-impacted ear would show obstruction of the external auditory canal by a brownish-yellow, waxy plug; the tympanic membrane would most likely not be visible.",

This condition is characterized by keratinizing squamous epithelium growing from the tympanic membrane or the auditory canal into the middle ear mucosa or the mastoid, causing chronic inflammation and erosion of the auditory ossicles. Cholesteatomas can be congenital or acquired. Acquired cholesteatomas can be classified as primary if caused by chronic negative middle ear pressure (due to eustachian tube dysfunction without middle ear infection) or secondary if caused by past injury to the tympanic membrane (typically due to chronic otitis media). The retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane and brown, irregular mass seen in this patient's otoscopy are characteristic of primary acquired cholesteatoma. Secondary acquired cholesteatomas, on the other hand, typically appear as a pearly white mass shining through the intact tympanic membrane.",

    "hint": "Severe ear pain, otorrhea, ear canal edema, and a tragus tender to touch are suggestive of acute otitis externa (AOE), which is most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Using earplugs can cause injury to the skin and increase moisture in the external auditory canal, which increases the risk of AOE.",

        "explanation_why": "AOE is treated with a topical preparation that contains a steroid (e.g., hydrocortisone, betamethasone) and an antimicrobial that is effective against the most common causative bacteria of AOE (e.g., aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone). A commonly used and effective combination is ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone. Alternatively, a combination of neomycin, polymyxin B, and hydrocortisone may be used. Further treatment includes aural toilet to remove debris and NSAIDs for pain relief. The tympanic membrane (TM) must be assessed prior to initiating therapy; if the TM is not intact or cannot be visualized, topical aminoglycosides and aural toilet are contraindicated because of an increased risk of damage to the middle ear. Ear swabs and oral antibiotic therapy should be considered if the patient does not respond to initial therapy, has severe AOE (i.e., completely occluded external auditory canal, fever, cervical lymphadenitis), or has risk factors for malignant otitis externa (e.g., immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus).\n\nIn mild cases of AOE (i.e., only mild discomfort or pruritus with minimal edema of the auditory canal), a topical antiseptic preparation (e.g., acetic acid) without an antibiotic may be considered. Patients suspected to have malignant otitis externa require a more extensive diagnostic workup (e.g., blood cultures, CT scan) and intravenous antibiotic therapy in addition to topical therapy.",

The most important risk factor for lymphoma development in SS is persistent salivary gland enlargement. Although the pathophysiology of lymphoma development in SS is not entirely known, B-cell activation and chronic inflammation are thought to play a role. MALT lymphoma is the most common lymphoma in patients with SS, followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Other common complications in patients with SS are related to xerostomia and include gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrophic oral candidiasis, and increased risk of dental caries. Patients with SS can develop a dry cough as a result of xerotrachea and xerobronchitis (the most likely cause in this patient with a normal chest CT) or interstitial lung disease. Patients with primary SS are often positive for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, both of which are specific types of ANA.\n\nParotid enlargement is more common in primary than in secondary SS.",

Following a tsetse fly bite, an ulcerating skin nodule (trypanosomal chancre) with regional lymphadenopathy would develop at the site of T. brucei inoculation, and this primary lesion would resolve spontaneously within 1–2 weeks. However, nasal ulceration is not consistent with this condition. Instead, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise, weight loss) and neurological symptoms (e.g., personality changes, altered sleep-wake cycle, ataxia, delayed hyperesthesia) would be expected. Furthermore, African trypanosomiasis is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, not South America, where this patient emigrated from.",

        "explanation_why": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) manifests as an ulcerating skin lesion at the site of a sandfly bite; the lesion gradually resolves without treatment. However, certain species of Leishmania (L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. panamensis) can cause mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) months to years after CL resolves. The nasopharynx is typically affected in ML, which can result in nasal blockage, mucosal bleeding, and/or septal destruction. Cervical lymphadenopathy can also occur. South America (especially Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil), where the patient emigrated from, is an endemic region for Leishmania species that cause ML. ML warrants systemic therapy using amphotericin B, miltefosine, or sodium stibogluconate.\n\nVisceral leishmaniasis, a more severe form of leishmaniasis, is primarily caused by Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum, both of which are also transmitted via sand flies. This form of leishmaniasis is also known as “kala-azar” (black fever in Hindi).",

Also, most patients with histoplasmosis are typically immunocompromised and present with fever, fatigue, weight loss, pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough), and/or hepatosplenomegaly.

However, in asthma, rhinorrhea is usually due to chronic allergic rhinitis, and characteristic features of lower airway involvement (e.g., dyspnea and chest tightness, end-expiratory wheezes) would be expected. While inhaled beclomethasone has no benefit in patients with acute viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis, short-term application of topical, intranasal steroids (e.g., fluticasone, beclomethasone) may be indicated to reduce nasal symptoms and inflammation.",

In addition, topical, intranasal steroids (e.g., fluticasone, beclomethasone), nasal saline lavage, and decongestive nose drops (e.g., oxymetazoline) can provide symptomatic relief. If bacterial rhinosinusitis or bacterial superinfection is suspected, antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate or, in this adult patient with penicillin allergy, with doxycycline, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin, is indicated for 5–10 days. Further imaging tests are generally not recommended unless a complication (e.g., orbital cellulitis) or a differential diagnosis (e.g., nasal polyps) is suspected.",

He initially noticed difficulty writing but now has difficulty performing his activities of daily living. He currently lives with his son. He has no personal or family history of serious illness and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. There is mild atrophy and twitching of the tongue. Muscle strength is decreased in the upper extremities and normal in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the upper extremities, 4+ in the right lower extremity, and 2+ in the left lower extremity. Sensation to pinprick, light touch, and vibration is intact in all extremities. On mental status examination, he is cooperative with a mildly anxious mood and a neutral affect. His speech is slightly slurred and hypernasal. Needle electromyography shows spontaneous fasciculation potentials in multiple muscles, fibrillations, and positive sharp wave potentials. Spirometry shows an FVC of 85% of predicted. A diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is made and treatment with riluzole is initiated. After discussion with the patient and his son, a decision to transfer the patient to hospice care is made. Before transferring the patient to hospice care, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "ALS is characterized by concomitant upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron dysfunction and can manifest with pseudobulbar palsy and bulbar palsy, both of which result in dysphagia. Dysphagia increases the risk for aspiration and/or insufficient fluid and food intake, leading to complications in patients with ALS (e.g., aspiration pneumonia, weight loss). A bedside swallowing test should therefore be performed in all patients with ALS to screen for dysphagia. If the test is positive, a formal swallowing study (e.g., videofluoroscopic swallowing examination) is required to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with ALS who have swallowing difficulties may need specialized nutritional support (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids, nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). Bedside swallowing test is also performed for other neurological conditions that manifest with dysphagia, such as Parkinson disease, acute stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\nIn addition to the bedside swallowing test, this patient should be asked about their wishes regarding resuscitation. ALS can result in cognitive impairment in the later stages, and the patient's resuscitation wishes (e.g., do not resuscitate order) should be determined while their mental faculties are intact.",

However, these symptoms usually manifest within the first weeks of life, especially in cases of tracheal compression. In addition, vascular ring anomalies typically also result in dyspnea, dysphagia, and choking, none of which are seen here. Moreover, the stridor caused by a vascular ring classically improves with neck extension, not by lying in the prone position.",

Manifestations include inspiratory stridor that improves in the prone position and worsens in the supine position and during feeding and crying, as seen in this infant. In addition, 60–70% of children with laryngomalacia have symptoms of gastroesophageal and/or laryngopharyngeal reflux (e.g., frequent regurgitation) due to the higher intrathoracic pressures needed to overcome the inspiratory obstruction. Symptoms of laryngomalacia usually peak at 6–8 months of age, then resolve spontaneously by 2 years of age in ∼ 90% of cases as the cartilages strengthen. The diagnosis is confirmed with flexible laryngoscopy. Because laryngomalacia is a benign, self-limited condition, reassurance and close follow-up are generally sufficient.",

He was delivered at 35 weeks' gestation because of premature rupture of membranes. Apgar scores were 8 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. His parents refused prenatal screening. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 146/min, respirations are 51/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa. Crackles are heard throughout both lung bases. There is a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border. Insertion of a nasogastric tube is attempted but the tube cannot be passed beyond 6 cm from the gums. An x-ray with contrast shows a blind-ended esophageal pouch; there is abundant gas in the stomach. Screening for which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 146/min, respirations are 51/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa. Crackles are heard throughout both lung bases. There is a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border. Insertion of a nasogastric tube is attempted but the tube cannot be passed beyond 6 cm from the gums. An x-ray with contrast shows a blind-ended esophageal pouch; there is abundant gas in the stomach. Screening for which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Coughing and choking spells when feeding, in conjunction with cyanosis, crackles on lung auscultation, and the inability to pass a feeding tube, suggest esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). This diagnosis is confirmed by the x-ray findings. The harsh systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation suggests a cardiac structural anomaly.",

        "explanation_why": "Esophageal atresia with TEF is caused by a defect in mesodermal differentiation. About 50% of esophageal atresia cases are associated with other mesodermal defects, known as the VACTERL association: Vertebral anomaly, Anal atresia, Cardiac anomaly, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Renal anomaly (including agenesis), and Limb malformation. Newborns with esophageal atresia should, therefore, undergo screening for other VACTERL anomalies. Screening typically includes echocardiography and renal ultrasonography.\n\nEsophageal atresia with TEF to the distal esophageal segment is the most common type of esophageal atresia, accounting for > 75% of cases. A fetus with esophageal atresia is unable to swallow amniotic fluid, resulting in polyhydramnios, which can lead to premature rupture of membranes and premature labor, as seen here.",

In patients with TGV, however, oxygenation is not affected by crying.

        "explanation_why": "Bilateral choanal atresia, a congenital condition characterized by complete blockage of the nasal cavity, typically manifests immediately after birth with respiratory distress, grunting breath sounds, and central cyanosis which improves with crying and worsens with feeding and at rest. The best initial test is the passage of a catheter through the nares, which is not possible in bilateral choanal atresia. Contrast rhinography in the supine position or CT scan of the facial bones confirms the diagnosis. After establishing an oropharyngeal airway, transnasal endoscopic resection of the posterior nasal septum is the most appropriate treatment to provide a permanent nasal airway. These procedures help prevent life-threatening cyanotic attacks and aspiration when the newborn's mouth is blocked during feeding. Finally, the newborn should be examined for other congenital anomalies since choanal atresia is often associated with CHARGE syndrome.\n\nSplitting of the second heart sound, as seen in this newborn, occurs physiologically during inspiration, which leads to delayed closure of the pulmonary valve (P_2) due to increased right ventricular ejection time.",

This condition may manifest immediately after birth with respiratory distress and cyanotic attacks, similar to what is seen in this patient. Since newborns with EA are unable to swallow properly, excessive foamy secretions at the mouth would also be expected.

Symptoms of TOF depend on the severity of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO) and may fluctuate, similar to the fluctuating cyanosis seen in this infant. However, infants with TOF and episodic cyanosis (i.e., tet spells) typically have mild RVOTO and only become symptomatic at 2–4 months of age. In contrast, newborns with TOF and cyanosis immediately after birth usually have severe RVOTO with symptoms that do not fluctuate or improve with crying.

However, SJS typically develops shortly after initiation of lamotrigine therapy, rather than years later, and manifests with cutaneous (e.g., targetoid erythematous macules), ocular (e.g., conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers), and urogenital (e.g., urethritis, erosive vaginitis) features.",

Some studies suggest that oral acyclovir decreases viral shedding, which decreases the duration and severity of infection when administered within 72 hours of symptom onset. Supportive care alone is indicated in patients who present > 72 hours after symptom onset. Antiviral therapy cannot treat latent infections or prevent disease recurrence. Additional treatment measures for herpetic gingivostomatitis include adequate hydration, analgesia, antipyretics, prevention of lip adhesions through barrier creams (e.g., petroleum jelly), and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.\n\nImmunocompromised patients with herpetic gingivostomatitis should receive IV acyclovir regardless of symptom duration, and hospitalization may also be required.",

BPPV results from dislodged or abnormally adherent otoliths, leading to semicircular canal dysfunction. During the test, a set of specific sequential head positioning maneuvers are used to provoke symptoms. The presence of positional vertigo and nystagmus during the maneuvers indicates a positive test and confirms the diagnosis. Although BPPV resolves spontaneously in about half of all patients, canalith repositioning maneuvers (e.g., Epley maneuver) can also be performed in order to mobilize the otoliths out of the involved semicircular canals.",

            "description": "A testing procedure used in patients with episodic triggered vertigo to evaluate for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).Starting in an upright seated position, the patient's head is rapidly rotated 45 degrees towards one side. Maintaining this degree of rotation, the patient is then quickly reclined and their head extended slightly below the end of the examination table (∼ 20 degrees). While holding this position, the examiner observes for 20–30 seconds for nystagmus and inquires regarding vertigo symptoms. The procedure is then repeated with the head rotated in the opposite direction. The test is positive (confirming BPPV) if the maneuver triggers nystagmus and/or vertigo during the observation period.\n\nThe Dix-Hallpike test with head rotation to the right tests the right posterior semicircular canal and the left anterior semicircular canal (and vice versa).\nIllustrated here are the movements of the otoconia during the maneuver (black dots and arrows) and the upbeat nystagmus with an ipsiversive torsional component (i.e., the eye beats toward the forehead and the upper pole of the eye beats toward the affected ear), which represents a typical finding in posterior semicircular canal BPPV (present in approx. 95% of all patients with). In posterior canal BPPV, a positive result should only occur when the affected ear is turned towards the floor (unless BPPV is bilateral).\n\nIn anterior canal BPPV (rare), the nystagmus is downbeat instead (while maintaining the ipsiversive torsional component), and lateralization is less reliable (even in unilateral BPPV, testing either side may elicit nystagmus).",

However, symptomatic episodes of Meniere disease usually last from minutes to hours and are not triggered by positioning while symptoms of acoustic neuroma typically have an insidious onset and a chronic course; this patient's brief and recurrent episodes of vertigo suggest a different diagnosis. In addition, both Meniere disease and acoustic neuroma typically manifest with hearing loss and tinnitus, neither of which are seen here.",

She is a mixed martial arts athlete and has been training intensively for an upcoming tournament. The pain started soon after she received a blow to the ear during a training fight. She reports taking ibuprofen for the pain and tried “not to pay attention to it,” but the pain has worsened. Her personal and family history is unremarkable and she takes no other medications. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.0°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 113/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 3-cm mildly tender, fluctuant mass on the right antihelix with purple skin discoloration; there is a firm, irregular, nontender deformity of the left auricle. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

Timely drainage of the hematoma prevents infection, relieves pressure, and preserves ear function and appearance, preventing the formation of cauliflower ear, which this patient already has in the left ear. Prophylactic antibiotics with coverage against skin flora and P. aeruginosa such as ciprofloxacin should also be considered. Patients should be followed up daily to assess for reaccumulation of the hematoma and/or signs of infection. If the hematoma does not reaccumulate, patients can return to sports after 7 days.",

As most individuals who develop auricular hematomas are involved in some sort of contact sport and frequently experience injury, they may not see the need to seek medical attention.

The symptoms appeared suddenly while she was on a flight back from a business trip to New Mexico. She has had mild nasal congestion and rhinorrhea for the past 3 days. She has no other history of serious illness and takes no medications. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal examination shows mildly inflamed turbinates and purulent discharge. There is no pain to palpation over the nasal sinuses. Cervical lymph nodes are not palpable. On otoscopic examination, there is bleeding into the left tympanic cavity; the left tympanic membrane is intact. The right ear shows no abnormalities. Rinne test is negative in the left ear and positive in the right ear. Weber test lateralizes to the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Glucocorticoids can be used as an adjunctive treatment for epiglottitis, but they are not routinely recommended because studies have demonstrated mixed results.",

Blood cultures should be obtained before administering antibiotics to tailor antibiotic therapy as needed. This patient presents with tachypnea, inspiratory stridor, and drooling, all of which raise concern for impending airway obstruction. In unstable patients, the airway should be secured to prevent respiratory collapse, before obtaining cultures or administering antibiotics.",

        "explanation_why": "Bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen is the first step in the management of patients with epiglottitis who are experiencing partial airway obstruction. This measure provides respiratory support, prevents exhaustion, and serves as a bridge to endotracheal intubation. This patient has clinical features of acute respiratory distress (e.g., tachypnea, inspiratory stridor, accessory muscle breathing, low oxygen saturation); therefore, immediate bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen is warranted. A practitioner experienced in difficult airway management should perform emergency endotracheal intubation in a controlled setting under direct visualization (using a video-assisted laryngoscopy, if available) to further secure the patient's airway.\n\nSince the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, epiglottitis no longer mainly manifests as a life-threatening illness in children and is now predominantly seen in adults, particularly those with a BMI > 25, a history of diabetes mellitus, coexistent pneumonia, or a preceding upper respiratory infection.",

        "explanation_why": "Emergency cricothyroidotomy is indicated in a cannot intubate-cannot ventilate (CICV) scenario, which is usually defined as the failure to intubate after three attempts or to maintain oxygenation or ventilation in between intubation attempts. In adult patients with acute epiglottitis, however, only one attempt at endotracheal intubation should be made before an emergency cricothyroidotomy is performed at the bedside. Patients with epiglottitis can develop worsening respiratory distress despite appropriate bag-mask ventilation, and they are predisposed to rapid progression to complete airway obstruction following any manipulation of the epiglottis. Therefore, as soon as epiglottitis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the management of difficult airways (e.g., anesthesiologist or otolaryngologist) should be notified and an intubation kit that includes the most advanced difficult airway adjuncts available (e.g., video laryngoscope, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope) should be obtained.\n\nIn children under 12 years of age with epiglottitis, needle cricothyroidotomy is preferred because of the funnel shape and narrowness of the trachea at the height of the cricoid ring as opposed to adults, in whom the trachea is narrowest at the level of the vocal cords.",

However, this strategy is not effective in preventing side effects such as MRONJ.

        "explanation_why": "MRONJ is a rare but serious side effect of bisphosphonate therapy and is most commonly seen in high-dose IV administration in cancer patients, but it can also occur with oral administration (e.g., for osteoporosis). The underlying pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, but it is assumed that bisphosphonate's antiangiogenic effects in combination with the jaw's specific characteristics (e.g., high metabolism) play a role. Invasive dental procedures are a major risk factor for the development of MRONJ. Therefore, patient education and preventive measures, such as a comprehensive dental examination in conjunction with treatment of preexisting dental conditions (e.g., extraction of unrestorable teeth), are strongly encouraged prior to initiation of antiresorptive therapy. After the initiation of therapy, a daily oral care plan should be encouraged, entailing instructions on oral hygiene (e.g., daily oral rinsing, brushing, and flossing) as well as regular check-ups and cleanings.\n\nTreatment of established MRONJ is mainly supportive and includes improved oral hygiene, antibiotic treatment, and limited debridement. Surgery should be avoided if possible.",

He says that his breath has recently “picked up a weird smell.” He has had no fever, weight loss, or difficulty speaking. He has gastroesophageal reflux disease and recurrent cold sores. He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. His medications are pantoprazole and topical acyclovir as needed. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years but quit 20 years ago. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 98 kg (216 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows an enlarged left tonsil with an ulcerous lesion but no purulent exudate. There is ipsilateral cervical nontender lymphadenopathy.

        "explanation_why": "In the US, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is responsible for 70% of all new cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx, which includes the base of the tongue, the palatine tonsils and tonsillar pillars, the soft palate, and the pharyngeal wall. While HPV-negative oropharynx tumors are associated with dietary nitrosamine, alcohol consumption, and smoking, HPV-positive SCC is associated with the sexual transmission of high-risk HPV subtypes (e.g., types 16 and 18). These HPV subtypes produce the E7 protein, which inhibits retinoblastoma protein and consequently promotes increased cell proliferation. Patients usually present with subacute progressive sore throat, halitosis, and dysphagia.\n\nDiagnosis of oropharynx cancers requires a biopsy (e.g., fine needle aspiration or punch biopsy) followed by panendoscopy and CT chest and/or MRI of the head and neck for staging. Management options include surgery or radiation with or without chemotherapy.",

The anterior cervical lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally but are not tender to palpation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.1 g/dL, leukocyte count is 6500/mm^3, and platelet count is 170,000/mm^3.

Diphtheria manifests acutely with sore throat, malaise, fever, pseudomembranous pharyngitis, and painful lymphadenopathy. Oral HPV infection manifests with warts or oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (SCC). Oropharyngeal SCC can result in a nontender ulcerative lesion and painless cervical lymphadenopathy, but there is no evidence of a malignancy on this patient's lymph node biopsy. There is currently no immunization available against this patient's infection.",

His nontender oral ulcer with raised, indurated borders (chancre) and concomitant nontender lymphadenopathy (due to reactive follicular hyperplasia) is consistent with primary syphilis. The chancre is usually solitary, and develops at the site of inoculation after about 3 weeks. The chancre resolves without scarring after 3–6 weeks regardless of treatment. While primary syphilitic lesions most often occur in the genital region, about 5–10% of cases of primary syphilis are extragenital. Typical localizations are the oral cavity, hands and fingers, or the anus and perianal region, which reflect sexual practices, but chancres can occur wherever the skin has been in contact with Treponema pallidum from infectious sores. The use of a condom during vaginal or anal sex, and a dental dam during oral sex, can protect an individual against STIs by preventing contact with body fluids or an infectious lesion.",

If central AVS is suspected but the initial MRI is inconclusive (which can be the case for several hours after onset of AVS due to stroke), repeat MRIs should be performed.\n\nDemyelinating diseases of the CNS (e.g., multiple sclerosis) are a cause of central AVS in young adults and are associated with a more gradual progression of symptoms when compared to AVS due to stroke.",

            "description": "A testing procedure used in patients with episodic triggered vertigo to evaluate for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).Starting in an upright seated position, the patient's head is rapidly rotated 45 degrees towards one side. Maintaining this degree of rotation, the patient is then quickly reclined and their head extended slightly below the end of the examination table (∼ 20 degrees). While holding this position, the examiner observes for 20–30 seconds for nystagmus and inquires regarding vertigo symptoms. The procedure is then repeated with the head rotated in the opposite direction. The test is positive (confirming BPPV) if the maneuver triggers nystagmus and/or vertigo during the observation period.\n\nThe Dix-Hallpike test with head rotation to the right tests the right posterior semicircular canal and the left anterior semicircular canal (and vice versa).\nIllustrated here are the movements of the otoconia during the maneuver (black dots and arrows) and the upbeat nystagmus with an ipsiversive torsional component (i.e., the eye beats toward the forehead and the upper pole of the eye beats toward the affected ear), which represents a typical finding in posterior semicircular canal BPPV (present in approx. 95% of all patients with). In posterior canal BPPV, a positive result should only occur when the affected ear is turned towards the floor (unless BPPV is bilateral).\n\nIn anterior canal BPPV (rare), the nystagmus is downbeat instead (while maintaining the ipsiversive torsional component), and lateralization is less reliable (even in unilateral BPPV, testing either side may elicit nystagmus).",

        "explanation_why": "In a patient with features of central AVS, a lumbar puncture (LP) could be considered if multiple sclerosis (MS) is suspected based on the clinical presentation (e.g., in a young adult who has gradually progressing symptoms) but imaging shows no evidence of MS. The patient's smoking history, comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus), and sudden symptom onset suggest a different cause of the central AVS, for which LP is not indicated.",

The mother says he has been tugging on his left ear since yesterday evening. He was born at 35 weeks' gestation and was exclusively breastfed until 3 months of age, when the parents introduced formula feeding. He is now eating some solid foods and receives one bottle of formula at night. He underwent cheiloplasty at 3 months of age because of an incomplete cleft lip. He and his two older siblings spend time together on weekdays when looked after by an au pair. He has been attending parent-child swimming classes for the past 2 months. His father smokes one-half pack of cigarettes daily; his mother does not smoke. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg. Examination of the pharynx reveals pink tonsils. Otoscopy of the left ear shows erythematous and bulging tympanic membrane with loss of landmarks. Examination of the right ear shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?",

        "explanation_why": "Formula feeding and associated lack of breastfeeding increase the risk for AOM most likely because of the lack of maternal antibodies as well as physical factors (e.g., feeding position, altered pharyngeal pressure) that lead to the pooling of milk in the eustachian tube. Although this patient has only been breastfed for three months, any duration of breastfeeding is more protective than no breastfeeding at all.

        "explanation_why": "Passive tobacco exposure leads to an increased risk of AOM most likely because nicotine reduces the mucociliary clearance of the eustachian tube and increases the susceptibility of the mucosa of the middle ear to infection. The incidence of AOM in children peaks at 6–12 months of age, which might be related to a shorter and more horizontal Eustachian tube and feeding in a supine position that allows nasal secretions to enter the middle ear cavity. Other risk factors include a family history of AOM, daycare attendance, lack of breastfeeding, pacifier use, and anatomical abnormalities (e.g., cleft palate).",

        "explanation_why": "Laryngeal papillomatosis is the most common form of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), which develops as a result of human papillomavirus virus (HPV) infection (most commonly HPV 6 and HPV 11). Juvenile-onset RRP usually develops before the age of 5 years and is due to vertical transmission of HPV from the mother during vaginal delivery. This patient's mother has a history of a sexually transmitted infection, did not receive prenatal care, and had a vaginal birth, all of which increase the risk of vertical HPV transmission. Progressive hoarseness, cough, and dyspnea are typical of RRP. Other symptoms include dysphonia or aphonia, stridor, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is typically established using laryngoscopy, which shows raspberry-like growths located on the vocal cords. There is no definitive treatment for RRP. Management aims to limit the spread of disease via surgical excision of symptomatic lesions and potentially antiviral adjuvant therapy (e.g., cidofovir, interferon). Complications include malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma, airway obstruction, and life-threatening respiratory distress.\n\nSee “Differential diagnoses of benign laryngeal lesions” table.",

The mother says her daughter had three episodes of the same symptoms that resolved with antibiotics during the past year. The patient attends daycare 5 days per week and participates in parent-child swimming classes. She has no known medication allergies. Her vaccinations are up-to-date. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg. On examination, she cries and tugs on her right ear. Otoscopy of the right ear shows an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane with an air-fluid level in the anterosuperior quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best approach to prevent the recurrence of these symptoms in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion should be considered in children with recurrent AOM (i.e., ≥ 4 episodes in 12 months or ≥ 3 episodes in 6 months). The placement of small tubes in the tympanic membrane enables the drainage of fluid and helps to maintain an air-filled space in the middle ear, which can decrease the frequency of AOM episodes. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in recurrent AOM is not recommended.\n\nAcute management of AOM, on the other hand, consists of analgesia (acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen). Antibiotic treatment (e.g., oral amoxicillin) is indicated in patients ≤ 6 months of age, in those < 2 years of age with bilateral AOM, and in all patients with severe infections (moderate to severe otalgia, otalgia lasting > 48 hours, and/or fever ≥ 39°C). Daycare attendance is a risk factor for AOM because of increased exposure to respiratory pathogens.",

            "description": "The procedure can be performed under local or general anesthesia; general anesthesia is usually required for children. An operating microscope is preferred, although the procedure can be performed using a handheld operating otoscope.1. A radial incision is made in the anterior-inferior quadrant of the pars tensa using a myringotomy blade.\n2. Alligator forceps are used to insert the tympanostomy tube. Short-term tubes (I) are designed to self-extrude after approximately one year, whereas long-term tubes (II) have a longer flange that prevents extrusion.\n3. A curved or angled pick can be used to facilitate correct placement.",

The lesions are painless and do not cause any discomfort but “look weird.” He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He has been sexually active with one female partner and two male partners during the past year and uses condoms inconsistently. His immunizations are up-to-date. The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. Ten years ago, he experimented with intravenous drugs but “it was a one-time thing.” His vital signs are within normal limits. A photograph of his mouth is shown. The lesions are nontender and do not come off when scraped with a tongue blade. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. HIV antibody test is positive and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 380/mm^3. Serologic studies for hepatitis B and C are negative. In addition to initiating combined antiretroviral therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of the oral lesions?",

        "explanation_why": "Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is first-line treatment for all patients with OSA. PAP functions as a pneumatic splint, preventing airway collapse, thereby reducing the frequency of respiratory events. PAP therapy is administered via a mask that can apply continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) with different levels for inhalation and exhalation, or a range of automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) levels. This treatment reduces disease severity, helps to control hypertension, and improves sleep-related quality of life. Alternative treatment methods (e.g., oral appliances, positional therapy) should be considered in patients unable to tolerate PAP.",

            "description": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder and is typically associated with obesity, especially around the neck (short, wide “bull neck”). The relaxation and collapse of the pharyngeal muscles (e.g., tongue, uvula, soft palate) during sleep results in the obstruction of the upper airways. This obstruction causes multiple episodes of interrupted breathing (apnea and hypopnea events) as well as irregular snoring (due to soft-tissue vibrations caused by the obstructed airflow during respiration), gasping, or choking episodes.",

Treatment options include manual cerumen removal, ear canal irrigation, and cerumenolytics, used alone or in combination. Cerumen removal is not indicated for asymptomatic cerumen accumulation, except for cases in which a thorough assessment of the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, or audiovestibular apparatus is necessary. While anyone can develop cerumen impaction, it is most common in individuals with risk factors for cerumen impaction, such as regular insertion of objects into the ear canal (e.g., cotton-tipped swabs), anatomical ear abnormalities, dermatological conditions (e.g., eczema, seborrheic dermatosis), and individuals who are unable to recognize or communicate symptoms (i.e., young children, individuals with cognitive impairment, and older adults). Prevention involves patient education on ear hygiene. In individuals with recurrent cerumen impaction, cerumen removal regimens may be considered.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "The presence of gait instability, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting indicate that vertigo due to acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is the most likely cause of this patient's acute-onset dizziness. The presence of all of the following on HINTS examination strongly suggests peripheral vertigo: spontaneous unidirectional horizontal nystagmus, absent skew deviation, and abnormal head impulse test (i.e., impaired vestibuloocular reflex).",

This condition is caused by inflammation of the membranous labyrinth that is usually idiopathic, autoimmune, or caused by a viral (e.g., following an upper respiratory infection) or bacterial infection (e.g., as a complication of otitis media). Labyrinthitis causes decreased vestibular activity and typically manifests with nystagmus toward the healthy ear. Diagnosis is clinical and does not routinely require neuroimaging.",

Cholesteatomas can be congenital or acquired. Acquired cholesteatomas are classified as primary if caused by chronic negative middle ear pressure (due to eustachian tube dysfunction without middle ear infection) or secondary if caused by past injury to the tympanic membrane (typically due to chronic otitis media). The retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane and the brown, irregular mass are characteristic otoscopic findings of primary acquired cholesteatoma. The typical otoscopic appearance of secondary acquired cholesteatomas is a pearly white mass shining through the intact tympanic membrane.\n\nSurgery is always required to excise cholesteatomas because of the risk of complications of the growing mass, which include the destruction of ear ossicles, perilymph fistula, and facial nerve paralysis.",

This condition is rare but potentially life-threatening and necessitates immediate airway stabilization, followed by initiation of empiric IV antibiotics and bronchoscopy for both diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic airway debridement. Stridor caused by bacterial tracheitis does not improve with nebulized racemic epinephrine, unlike stridor due to croup. Bronchoscopy typically reveals tracheal edema, pseudomembranous exudates, and purulent secretions.
