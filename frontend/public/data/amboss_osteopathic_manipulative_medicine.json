The pain radiates to the radial aspect of her left forearm, thumb, and index finger. She first noticed her symptoms after helping a friend set up a canopy tent. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. When the patient extends and rotates her head to the left and downward pressure is applied, she reports paresthesias along the radial aspect of her left forearm and thumb. There is weakness when extending the left wrist against resistance. The brachioradialis reflex is 1+ on the left and 2+ on the right. The radial pulse is palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, these symptoms are generally confined to the hand, specifically the palmar radial aspect, the first three digits, and the radial half of the fourth digit. Symptoms are often worse at night or after repetitive movements of the hand. The patient here does not have this pattern of symptoms. Additionally, a patient with CTS would not have pain in the neck or arm, weakness when extending the wrist (a sign of damage to the radial nerve or its corresponding cervical nerve roots), nor pain with Spurling's test.",

However, symptoms would be bilateral and usually include decreased sensation in a “cape-like” distribution secondary to the progressive compression and damage to crossing neural fibers of the lateral spinothalamic tract. It would also manifest as flaccid paralysis and muscle atrophy due to damage to the medial part of the corticospinal tract.",

However, rather than causing symptoms to one specific nerve root, TOS usually compresses the lower trunk (C8–T1 nerve roots) of the brachial plexus. In a patient with TOS, Spurling's test would not recreate the patient's symptoms because the test is relatively specific for damage/irritation of the cervical nerve roots rather than the brachial plexus. Furthermore, TOS often affects vascular structures as well; patients present with arm pallor, coldness, decreased pulses, and/or cyanosis of the affected extremity, none of which is present in this patient.",

Classically, ALS manifests with symptoms of both upper motor neuron (e.g., increased muscle tone, spasticity, increased reflexes) and lower motor neuron dysfunction (e.g., flaccid paralysis, decreased reflexes, atrophy). Although possible, the majority of the patients do not report sensory dysfunction. This patient has pain and paresthesia that radiates from the neck distally to the arm and hand, indicating selective nerve root compression.",

The disease most commonly manifests between 50 and 70 years of age, often beginning with unilateral weakness in the hands or feet, which then progresses to the contralateral side (asymmetric limb weakness). However, initial manifestations are highly variable and individuals may have atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as subtle vocal changes. As the disease progresses, most individuals eventually develop one or both of the life-threatening symptoms: respiratory impairment and dysphagia.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient has cervical radiculopathy, most likely from a C5–C6 spinal disk herniation. Her radiating pain and paresthesias are caused by damage and/or irritation of the C6 nerve root, which innervates the radial aspect of the forearm and the thumb. These symptoms are reproduced with Spurling's maneuver, which has a high specificity for cervical radiculopathy. This patient's weakness results from damage to the same nerve root, as C6 provides motor function to the wrist extensors. C6 nerve root damage is also causing the decreased brachioradialis reflex in this patient, as C6 supplies motor function to that muscle.\n\nOther possible causes of the patient's radiculopathy include cervical spondylosis or a tumor causing nerve root compression. Her neurologic symptoms may also be caused by infections that affect the peripheral nervous system such as herpes zoster and Lyme disease. The diagnostic workup includes MRI, which would show a laterally prolapsed disk with surrounding edema in the case of disk herniation.",

The pain awakens him at night and is worse when he lies on the right shoulder. He does not have any paresthesia or numbness in the right arm. He is a painter, and these episodes of pain have not allowed him to work efficiently. He appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows painful abduction of the arm above the shoulder. There is severe pain when the elbow is flexed and the right shoulder is internally rotated. Elevation of the internally rotated and outstretched arm causes pain over the anterior lateral aspect of the shoulder. An x-ray of the shoulder shows no abnormalities. Injection of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine into the right subacromial space relieves the pain and increases the range of motion of the right arm.

The pain elicited in this patient is consistent with subacromial impingement syndrome. In addition, he lacks findings consistent with rotator cuff tear (e.g., loss of strength, displaced humeral head on x-ray), and he has not received prior therapy. An MRI of the shoulder is not indicated at this point.",

In patients who fail to improve with physical therapy and oral analgesics, subacromial glucocorticoid injections may provide symptomatic relief. If conservative therapy fails to improve symptoms, advanced imaging (e.g., MRI) should be obtained to rule out complications (e.g., rotator cuff tear), after which arthroscopic subacromial decompression can be considered.\n\nFor patients who present with shoulder pain, it is important to distinguish between impingement, tendinitis, and a tear of the rotator cuff.

Prostate cancer is frequently associated with skeletal metastases, with the spine being the most common location. Accordingly, some patients present with lower back pain as the initial manifestation. Red flags for metastatic bone disease include a history of cancer, advanced age, unexplained weight loss, and bone pain that does not improve after one month. Besides pain, which commonly occurs at night and exacerbates with movement, patients with metastatic bone disease from prostate cancer can present with pathologic fractures, hypocalcemia (due to osteoblastic metastasis), and neurological deficits (due to spinal cord compression).",

Symptoms typically improve when sitting or leaning forward (shopping-cart sign), as lumbar flexion widens the central spinal canal and relieves nerve root compression. In contrast, symptoms typically worsen with positions involving lumbar extension (e.g., walking, prolonged standing). This phenomenon is referred to as neuropathic claudication and is a hallmark of LSS.",

In surgeries that require the patient to be in a prone position (e.g., spinal surgery), improper positioning of the arms can compress and injure this nerve. This injury leads to paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, which manifests with medial winging of the scapula and weakened abduction of the shoulder above 90° (manifesting, e.g., during hair combing), as seen here. Further common causes of long thoracic nerve injury include invasive procedures (e.g., axillary lymph node dissection), direct trauma to the shoulder, and prolonged nerve compression (e.g., carrying a heavy backpack).\n\nThe musculocutaneous nerve also receives nerve fibers from C5–C7 spinal roots, but it arises as a branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus rather than directly from the spinal roots. Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve (e.g., a gunshot wound in the arm) manifests with loss of sensation over the lateral forearm and impaired flexion and supination of the forearm.",

Compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus can cause neuropathic pain, paresthesias, and sensory loss in the C8 and T1 dermatomes (i.e., 4^th and 5^th fingers, medial aspect of the arm), as seen here, and possibly weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. The symptoms in the case of a cervical rib are usually exacerbated by overhead arm elevation. Compression of the subclavian vessels is less common; subclavian vein compression results in swelling of the arm, and subclavian artery compression can cause acute or chronic limb ischemia and, possibly, subclavian steal syndrome. A positive Adson test, as seen here, is suggestive of a cervical rib. Other common causes of TOS are Pancoast tumor, muscular anomalies (e.g., supernumerary scalene muscles, neck muscle hypertrophy), and trauma (e.g., clavicle fracture).",
