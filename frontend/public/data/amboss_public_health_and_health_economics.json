If such travel is necessary during pregnancy, the use of mosquito repellent, mosquito nets, and long-sleeved, light-colored clothing help to prevent transmission.

Her last mammogram was 6 months ago and showed no abnormalities. Her last Pap smear was 2 years ago and unremarkable. A colonoscopy 5 years ago was normal. She regularly attends water aerobic classes and physical therapy for her back pain. Her mother died of breast cancer last year and her father has arterial hypertension. She is married and has two children. The patient recently got back from a cruise to Mexico where she celebrated her 40^th wedding anniversary. She takes a multivitamin daily and uses topical steroids. Her immunization records show that she has never received a pneumococcal or a shingles vaccine, her last tetanus booster was 6 years ago, and her last influenza vaccine was 2 years ago. She drinks one to two alcoholic beverages every weekend. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (160 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 84/min, and blood pressure is 124/70 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time?",

This patient's HbA_1c was 7.6% (typical goal is < 7%) 2 months ago, and it should be rechecked in 1 month.

The influenza vaccination helps prevent influenza and its complications, especially in vulnerable populations like older adults, very young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions. This patient with diabetes would particularly benefit from receiving the influenza vaccine because he is at higher risk of developing complications. Because he works at an assisted-living facility, he is also at increased risk of contracting and spreading the infection.",

Colonoscopy every 10 years is an appropriate strategy. Individuals with a first-degree relative (FDR) who have a history of colorectal cancer, like this patient, are generally recommended to obtain screening more frequently (every 5 years) and start earlier (40 years of age or 10 years before the youngest FDR's age at diagnosis).

        "explanation_why": "Most influenza vaccines are made from viruses grown in chicken eggs, raising the concern that allergic reactions might occur in those with a history of egg allergy. However, studies show that individuals with confirmed egg allergy can safely receive the influenza vaccine. According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), egg allergy of any severity is not a contraindication for influenza vaccines. All vaccines should be administered in settings where treatment can be given for an acute allergic reaction. No special precautions beyond this standard are required for the administration of influenza vaccine to patients with egg allergy regardless of allergy severity. An influenza vaccine is contraindicated in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis following previous administration of the vaccine or following exposure to a component of the vaccine other than egg protein.\n\nIndividuals aged ≥ 50 years should receive either the recombinant influenza vaccine or the inactivated influenza vaccine.",

He immigrated from Nepal 4 weeks ago to start his new job as a manager for a software company. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He has not received any routine childhood vaccinations. The patient appears healthy and well-nourished. He is 172 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m^2. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 123/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test is performed. Three days later, an induration of 12 mm is noted. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is a useful first test for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTBI) and an alternative to the PPD skin test. In addition, IGRA can be used to rule out false-positive results on initial screening (two-step testing strategy) in low TB incidence settings for patients with a low risk of infection in order to avoid overtreatment. However, this patient has an increased risk of infection because he recently immigrated from a country with high TB burden. In addition, he has diabetes mellitus, which is a risk factor for reactivation of LTBI. Therefore, another step in management is more appropriate than confirmatory testing with IGRA.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Patients with a PPD test showing an induration of ≥ 10 mm are considered TB-positive if they are at high risk, for example, if they have recently (< 5 years) immigrated from a country such as Nepal where TB is endemic. The next question is whether the patient has latent or active TB, which is determined by chest x-ray. If this patient had any symptoms of TB (e.g., fever, cough, night sweats, hemoptysis), he should be put on respiratory isolation prior to any further diagnostics to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nThe threshold for a positive PPD test depends on the individual risk factors of the patient. An induration of ≥ 5 mm is considered positive if one of the following applies: individuals living with HIV, patients under immunosuppression, individuals exposed to TB-positive cases, patients who have undergone organ transplants, and patients with chest x-rays suggestive of a prior TB infection. An induration of ≥ 10 mm is considered TB-positive if one of the following applies: individual who recently (< 5 years) immigrated from a high-prevalence country, individuals who use IV drugs, occupation or residency in high-risk congregate settings (e.g., homeless shelters, prisons), staff of a mycobacteriology laboratory, patients with certain chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus), and children < 4 years of age. Finally, an induration of ≥ 15 mm is considered positive in all patients without any risk factors, exposure, or symptoms.",

All patients with LTBI should receive treatment to prevent reactivation of the disease. Most patients with LTBI qualify for a short regimen of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine therapy for 3 months or daily isoniazid and rifampin therapy for 3 months. An alternative short regimen is 4 months of daily rifampin, which is typically prescribed to patients who do not tolerate isoniazid (INH) or who have been exposed to INH-resistant TB. In patients with HIV, long regimens of 6 or 9 months of isoniazid are the preferred treatment for LTBI (see “Drug regimens for treatment of LTBI” table).\n\nNote that INH is a vitamin B_6 antagonist and pyridoxine (vitamin B_6) should be considered as adjuvant therapy to prevent side effects such as peripheral neuropathy.",

However, this patient's normal chest x-ray and absence of clinical manifestations of TB make active, pulmonary TB very unlikely.

These procedures include certain dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, routine dental cleaning), procedures of the respiratory tract that involve incision of the respiratory mucosa, and cardiac surgery with prosthetic material (e.g., prosthetic heart valves). The most commonly used antibiotic regimen is oral amoxicillin administered 30–60 minutes prior to a high-risk procedure. Alternatives to amoxicillin include intravenous ampicillin in patients unable to take oral medication and azithromycin in patients allergic to penicillin.",

This rule was based on the principle of nonmaleficence, as transplantation of HIV-positive donor organs may pose harm to transplant recipients. However, the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act implemented in November 2015 now allows transplantation of organs from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive recipients, provided the donor has an undetectable viral load, no prior history of an opportunistic infection, no active fungal infection, and a CD4+ count over 500 cells/μL for a 6-month period prior to donation. None of these restrictions apply to this patient. This patient's history of HIV does not, therefore, affect his eligibility to donate his organs to HIV-positive recipients. Donor organs from HIV-positive individuals are not transplanted to non-HIV-positive patients.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient presents with sharply delineated erythema on the lower extremities and abdomen with sparing of the buttocks (doughnut pattern) in combination with sharp burn borders and no splash marks, suggesting a scald injury due to forced immersion in hot water. During forced immersion, the victim reflexively flexes their legs, leading to characteristic sparing of flexor surfaces (see “Overview of scalds” table). Additional concerning findings in this scenario include the delayed presentation (seeking medical care 2 days later), missed well-child visits, and the mother's expressed frustration with her child.\n\nChildren who experience physical abuse often present with multiple injuries in different stages of healing. Risk factors for perpetrating child maltreatment include history of experiencing childhood abuse or domestic violence, psychiatric conditions, and socioeconomic factors such as recent job loss and financial hardship. Physicians are legally obligated to report suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services, even if it requires breaking patient-physician confidentiality.",

However, these lesions tend to be raised (wheals) and are intensely itchy. Moreover, wheals associated with most physical urticaria usually disappear within an hour after the stimulus is removed; the persistence of the lesion for two days indicates a different diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is most commonly due to meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21 and frequently results in intellectual disability, behavioral disorders, delayed developmental milestones, congenital heart defects, and a depressed nasal bridge. Patients may also appear to have short palpebral fissures and hypertelorism due to epicanthal folds (pseudohypertelorism). However, patients with Down syndrome also typically have other manifestations, such as upslanting palpebral fissures, low-set ears, a short neck, furrowed protruding tongue, abnormal dentition, and a transverse palmar crease, which are all absent in this patient. A flat philtrum, thin upper lip, and microcephaly suggest a different cause of this patient's findings.",

Although patients with Williams syndrome typically manifest with facial dysmorphism (“elfin facies”), which may include midfacial hypoplasia and short palpebral fissures, some facial features differ from those seen in this patient (e.g., wide forehead, periorbital fullness, long philtrum, and dental hypoplasia). Patients with Williams syndrome do commonly have supravalvular aortic stenosis, which could result in a systolic heart murmur. In contrast to this patient, who has difficulty with social interactions, patients with Williams syndrome classically have an overfriendly demeanor and lack stranger anxiety.",

This patient's difficulties at school are due to the behavioral problems (e.g., hyperactivity and inattention) and intellectual disability (e.g., learning disabilities, memory and reasoning deficits, impaired language development) associated with FAS. This patient's pansystolic murmur heard best along the left lower sternal border is caused by a ventricular septal defect, which is often seen in patients with FAS.",

Other classical features include hypotonia and umbilical hernias, neither of which is seen in this patient.",

However, there is no history of a seizure disorder in the mother to suggest that she might have been prescribed phenytoin. Other common features of this condition include hypoplastic fingers and a cleft lip or palate. A flat philtrum and a thin upper lip suggest a different cause of this patient's findings.",

Vitamin D deficiency is a concern in exclusively breastfed infants who do not receive vitamin D prophylaxis. However, only a prolonged and severe vitamin D deficiency would result in hypocalcemia, and this condition is therefore unlikely in a 2-week-old patient. Furthermore, breast milk supplies the infant with abundant calcium, which makes hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism very unlikely.",

Breast milk contains very low amounts of vitamin K, so the risk of bleeding does not decrease with breastfeeding. All newborns typically receive an intramuscular vitamin K shot at birth to mitigate this risk. Because this child was delivered at home without any medical intervention, it is very likely that he did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis and is consequently at increased risk of bleeding, including potentially severe brain hemorrhage.",

However, this newborn was born at term and the delivery did not involve any complications. Breastfed infants are also at risk of IDA because breast milk contains only limited amounts of iron. To prevent IDA in breastfed infants, they should receive an additional iron source starting by 4 months of age in full-term infants and by 2 weeks of age in premature infants. Although this infant is being exclusively breastfed, he is not at increased risk of IDA at this time, as most full-term newborns have sufficient iron stores for up to 4 months.",

Individuals with a first-degree relative (FDR) with a history of colorectal cancer, like this patient, are generally recommended to obtain screening more frequently (every 5 years) and start earlier (40 years of age or 10 years before the youngest FDR's age at diagnosis). Because her last colonoscopy 4 years ago was normal and she lacks symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (e.g., weight loss, hematochezia), she does not require repeat screening at this time.",

This guidance differs from the recently updated ASCCP, ACS, and ACOG guidelines, which recommend that those aged 25–65 years undergo cervical cancer screening with primary HPV testing (where available) or HPV/Pap cotesting every 5 years. All guidelines recommend a solitary Pap smear every 3 years if HPV testing is unavailable.\n\nRegarding breast cancer, mammography is rarely useful in younger patients, who have naturally denser breast tissue. According to the USPSTF, breast cancer screening with mammography should be performed every 2 years between 40–74 years of age. Screening can be started earlier in patients with first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Breast cancer screening recommendations may differ between medical organizations (e.g., ACOG, ACS). Consult our table “Breast cancer screening for individuals at average risk” for the most up-to-date information on breast cancer screening recommendations.\n\nWhenever the information required to determine the correct answer for an NBME question involves a discrepancy between screening guidelines, we recommend following USPSTF recommendations.",

Her last menstrual period was 6 days ago. Her last Pap smear was 13 months ago and there is no history of abnormal findings. She is sexually active with three male partners and uses condoms consistently. She has never been tested for sexually transmitted infections. Her 54-year-old mother has breast cancer. She did not receive a human papillomavirus vaccine. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 68/min, and blood pressure is 108/68 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. In addition to HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis testing, which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time?",

        "explanation_why": "As part of the routine immunization schedule, the CDC states that two doses of the nine-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine should be administered six to twelve months apart to all individuals aged 9–14 years. For all unvaccinated female individuals aged 15–26 years, the CDC recommends vaccination with three doses of the nine-valent HPV vaccine at 0, 2, and 6 months. The HPV vaccine is approved by the FDA for individuals up to the age of 45 years, but it is not routinely recommended by the CDC for individuals aged > 26 years.\n\nCondoms lower the risk of, but do not protect against, HPV infection because HPV can still be transmitted via genital skin-to-skin contact or oral sex.",

Because her last menstrual period was six days ago, this patient does not have amenorrhea. If this 24-year-old woman had acute lower abdominal pain, a pregnancy test would be indicated to rule out an ectopic pregnancy. However, there is currently no indication for performing a pregnancy test in this asymptomatic patient presenting for a routine pelvic examination.",

It is the USPSTF's recommended cervical cancer screening of choice for women aged between 30 and 65 years every five years. In this 24-year-old patient, the USPSTF instead recommends a Pap smear every three years. Unfortunately, cancer screening recommendations can be confusing because the USPSTF guidelines differ from the recently updated ASCCP/ACS/ACOG guidelines, which recommend that women aged 25–65 years should undergo cervical cancer screening with primary HPV testing (preferred where available) every five years, cotesting (HPV testing and Pap smear) every five years, or a solitary Pap smear every three years. But this patient is not yet 25 years of age and also had a normal Pap smear 13 months ago. Regardless, if the information required to determine the correct option for NBME questions is associated with a discrepancy between screening guidelines, we recommend following USPSTF guidelines.",

        "explanation_why": "In pregnant women with high-grade precancerous lesions (i.e., CIN2 or CIN3), colposcopic surveillance with HPV-based testing every 12–24 weeks is preferred. Deferring colposcopy until ≥ 4 weeks after delivery is also an acceptable approach. The management of pregnant individuals with high-grade lesions differs from that of nonpregnant patients: treatment of premalignant lesions can safely be deferred until the postpartum period; expedited treatment for HSIL is contraindicated during pregnancy. A repeat biopsy should be performed if the cervical lesion appears to be worsening on colposcopic surveillance. An excisional procedure should be considered only if invasive cancer is suspected.\n\nColposcopy and biopsy are safe during pregnancy but endocervical curettage and endometrial biopsies are contraindicated.",

Female patients with Lynch syndrome have a ∼ 40% lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, with most cases occurring in premenopausal women. Lynch syndrome is also associated with an increased lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer (∼ 10%). Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at the end of childbearing age (∼ 40 years) is therefore recommended. In addition, women with Lynch syndrome should receive annual pelvic examination with transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy starting at the age of 30–35 years. Patients with Lynch syndrome should also undergo annual colonoscopy beginning at 20–25 years of age to screen for colorectal cancer.",

        "explanation_why": "Actinic keratosis is a precancerous lesion that occurs on sun-exposed skin (e.g., the scalp, face, ears, dorsal aspects of the hands or arms) and predominantly affects light-skinned individuals over 50 years of age. The lesions typically grow back after they are scraped off. Initially, actinic keratosis manifests as small lesions with a central scale and a rough surface, giving them a sandpaper-like texture on palpation. Later, the lesions may grow and become erythematous and scaly, as seen in this patient. The risk of progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma depends on the degree of epithelial dysplasia, but it is < 1% per year. Occasionally, hyperkeratosis may turn preexisting actinic keratosis lesions into cutaneous horns.\n\nActinic keratosis is usually a clinical diagnosis, although for lesions that are ≥ 1 cm, grow rapidly, or do not respond to treatment, a biopsy is necessary to distinguish it from squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment options include cryotherapy for isolated lesions, or 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, or photodynamic therapy in patients with multiple lesions.",

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes. Chest x-ray in reactivation TB typically shows multiple cavities in the upper lobes, calcifications, patchy consolidations, and features fibroproliferative disease (e.g, scarring) due to inflammatory tissue destruction.",

Patients with Down syndrome have a higher susceptibility to respiratory infections, but cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, white plaques on the tongue, and chronic diarrhea indicate a more generalized immunodeficiency. In addition, this patient lacks characteristic physical findings of Down syndrome such as micrognathia, flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism, and epicanthal folds.",

However, infections in CGD are typically recurrent and other manifestations such as skin, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary granulomas are expected. In addition, this disorder is caused by an X-linked recessive defect, but the patient is female, which makes a diagnosis of CGD very unlikely.",

A polymerase chain reaction test (PCR test) is used to diagnose HIV in children < 18 months of age. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) cannot be used in children < 18 months of age, because maternal HIV IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta, possibly leading to false-positive results.\n\nHIV testing is recommended for all pregnant women in the first trimester. In pregnant patients with HIV and an unknown viral load, scheduled cesarean delivery is usually recommended at 38 weeks' gestation to decrease the risk of vertical transmission. In mothers with HIV who have infants without HIV, breastfeeding should be avoided if possible. However, in resource-limited countries, breastfeeding may be considered. Maternal adherence to antiretroviral therapy decreases the risk of HIV transmission from breast milk.",

Parasitic larvae (cercariae) initially penetrate the skin and enter the circulation to mature, and eventually produce eggs that migrate through the venous system and can spread to the lungs, spleen, liver, brain, and/or bladder (depending on the species of Schistosoma). Intestinal and hepatosplenic involvement is commonly seen with Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma japonicum infection, while bladder involvement only occurs with Schistosoma haematobium. Unlike the eggs of S. mansoni and S. japonicum, which have a lateral spine and are shed via human feces, the eggs of S. haematobium have a terminal spine and are excreted in urine. S. mansoni is endemic to Africa and South America, S. japonicum to East Asia, and S. haematobium to Africa and the Middle East.\n\nTreatment of schistosomiasis includes praziquantel. Steroids can be added to the treatment to relieve hypersensitivity reactions.",

            "description": "An infected human, the definitive host of schistosomes, excretes schistosome eggs in urine or feces (yellow and brown arrow). The eggs hatch in water and release miracidia. These flat, ciliated larva penetrate specific freshwater snails, which then act as intermediate hosts. In the snail, the miracidia develop into sporocysts, which reproduce asexually to form cercaria. Cercaria are then released back in the water. When humans come in contact with contaminated water, cercaria can penetrate the skin and enter the circulation. As they lose their tail, the cercaria develop into schistosomula, which then mature into adult schistosomes in the venous system. At this point, a male and female adult worm mate and migrate to the veins of the target organs (liver, intestine, bladder). The female worm lies folded in the longitudinal cleft (schist) of the male worm and lays eggs, which causes inflammation of the organs. As a result of the inflammation, the eggs can penetrate the wall of the organ and enter the lumen of the intestine or bladder (depending on the species), and they are then eliminated in feces or urine.",

Histoplasmosis may also present with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhea, and acid-fastness. However, this patient has not been to regions where histoplasmosis is endemic (Mississippi and Ohio River valleys) and where he could have inhaled H. capsulatum spores from bat or bird droppings. Moreover, severely immunocompromised patients (CD4 count < 150/mm^3) with histoplasmosis usually present with more severe symptoms such as pancytopenia, renal failure, and shock.\n\nCombination therapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole is also indicated in disseminated coccidioidomycosis, which may present similar to a MAC infection and is likely in a patient with HIV and low CD4 count (< 250/mm^3). However, the meninges are typically also affected and the fungus Coccidioides is not acid-fast. In addition, this patient has not been to regions where the fungus is endemic (e.g., certain parts of California and Arizona).",

He has no history of serious illness except for an episode of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis at the age of 10 years. His father died of bladder carcinoma at the age of 55 years and his brother was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 61 years. The patient works at a rubber factory. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 12 years. He drinks 1–2 cans of beer per day. He takes no medications. His vaccinations are up-to-date. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The patient asks what additional health maintenance measures he should consider at this time. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement may be considered as part of the screening process for prostate cancer, a common malignancy that is often asymptomatic in the initial stages. Current screening guidelines for prostate-specific antigen testing are controversial. The use of PSA as a screening marker is constantly questioned because of potential overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and associated complications such as negative psychological effects, erectile dysfunction, or urine incontinence. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against any routine PSA-based screening for prostate cancer; they recommend that decisions about PSA assessment in men aged 55–69 years who inquire about screening be made based on patient preference after having received information on potential risks and benefits. The American Urological Association recommends PSA testing on a case-by-case basis in men aged 45–69 years after shared decision-making based on individual preferences. PSA testing is not recommended in men < 40 years of age.\n\nThis patient is 60 years old and he has a family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative; a discussion about PSA screening would be warranted. Following the discussion, PSA levels should only be obtained if the patient expresses that he wants to proceed with the screening test.",

Although metformin may be considered for some individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, the use of medication to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with metabolic syndrome is only considered if nonpharmacologic interventions fail.

        "explanation_why": "Lifestyle modifications that assist in weight reduction, such as increasing physical activity and adopting a healthier diet, are the primary treatments for metabolic syndrome. This patient's elevated fasting serum glucose suggests insulin resistance, which commonly develops in individuals with abdominal obesity. Increased physical activity and weight loss improve insulin sensitivity, which prevents the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other associated conditions (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia) and lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients should engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking) 5–7 times a week.\n\nDiagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome include insulin resistance (fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL), elevated blood pressure (systolic ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic ≥ 85 mm Hg), elevated triglycerides (≥ 150 mg/dL), decreased HDL (< 40 mg/dL in men, < 50 mg/dL in women), and increased waist circumference (≥ 102 cm in men, ≥ 88 cm in women). Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if ≥ 3 of these criteria are present. Waist circumference rather than BMI is relevant in diagnosing metabolic syndrome; although patients with metabolic syndrome are often overweight or obese, they can have a normal BMI.",

Therefore, all patients with CLD should be immunized against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.

Administration of hepatitis B vaccine is recommended in this patient as his serology for anti-HBs antibody indicates that he has not yet been immunized against HBV infection.",

HCC may be focal, multifocal, or diffuse.HCC receives the majority of its blood supply from branches of the hepatic artery. As a result, a characteristic pattern of early arterial enhancement and early washout is often seen on CT and MRI. This enhancement pattern may similarly be seen on contrast-enhanced ultrasound examinations.L: uninvolved liver parenchyma; PV: portal vein",

However, a biopsy is not used as a screening tool, as it is an invasive procedure that carries a risk of hemorrhage and tumor spread. Moreover, in most high-risk patients, including those with cirrhosis, HCC can usually be diagnosed noninvasively on imaging alone. Finally, this patient's ultrasonography shows a nodular liver, which is consistent with his diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis, but no features suspicious of HCC.",

He has been taking combined antiretroviral therapy since then. He feels well. He is sexually active with both female and male partners and regularly uses barrier protection. He does not smoke and drinks 2–3 glasses of wine on weekends. The patient did not receive any childhood vaccines besides the hepatitis B vaccine. Six years ago, he received the tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccination. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. His CD4+ T lymphocyte cell count is 190/mm^3. Which of the following immunizations should be administered at this time?",

Frequent follow-up visits also enable closer monitoring of the patient's medication use. Other strategies to improve medication adherence include providing written instructions, optimizing the treatment plan (e.g., prescribing once-daily scheduled medications when possible), and using the teach-back method.",

        "explanation_why": "HPV serotypes 16 and 18 are oncogenic viruses that increase the risk of CIN by producing the oncogenic proteins E6 and E7. The strongest predisposing factors for HPV infection are the early onset of sexual activity and multiple sexual partners. Women who engage in sexual activity before the age of 18 years are at twice the risk of cervical cancer compared to women who are 21 years or older when they first have intercourse. The risk of cervical cancer in women who have had ≥ 6 sexual partners is increased threefold compared with one partner. Other HPV-related risk factors include high-risk sexual behavior, a history of STIs, a history of immunosuppression, and intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol. Higher rates of cervical cancer have also been observed in women of low socioeconomic status and smokers (for squamous cell cancer types only).",

            "description": "Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by an infection of the transformation zone (rectangular box) with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV).HPVs infect the stem cells of the basal cell epithelium. Cell proliferation and migration of virus-infected daughter cells into the suprabasal cell layer allow the infection to spread. At the beginning of the process, the DNA of the virus is episomal. As the disease progresses, the DNA is integrated into the cervical epithelium's DNA. A noninvasive precursor lesion, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), may develop from an HPV infection over months to years, which may ultimately progress to invasive carcinoma.In most cases, complete recovery will occur during the early stages of an HPV infection.",

Smoking cessation is the single most important measure to slow the decline in lung function at all stages of COPD. It has been shown that the earlier the cessation is achieved, the greater the benefit for lung function. Other measures that improve lung function of COPD patients include treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators.",

Neurocysticercosis is a fecal-oral transmitted disease that results from ingestion of eggs of Taenia solium, which can be found in food and water contaminated by the feces of people with intestinal taeniasis. Several strategies have been described to prevent the infection, which include washing food prior to consumption, proper hand hygiene, and avoidance of raw pork meat, as well as adequate freezing and cooking of food to destroy the parasite.\n\nNeurocysticercosis is characterized by seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and focal neurologic deficits. Depending on the stage of disease, multiple ring-enhancing, cystic, and eventually calcified lesions can be seen on brain CT scan, some of which may show a scolex.",

Although meningococcal meningitis can also cause neurological deficits as in this patient, other important signs such as neck stiffness and signs of infection (e.g., fever) are not present. In addition, meningococcal meningitis does not cause ring-enhancing lesions but instead presents with inflamed meninges on imaging.

A negative HBsAg with positive anti-HBc IgM antibodies indicate that the infection is resolving. Anti-HBs antibody titers may not increase for up to 1–2 weeks following the disappearance of HbsAg from serum (window period), which is why measuring anti-HBc antibody titers in patients with suspected acute hepatitis B infection is important.\n\nThe presence of HBsAg on serology denotes an acute hepatitis B infection. While anti-HBc is the first antibody to be made, it does not offer immune clearance of hepatitis B. However, anti-HBc may be the only marker of infection during the seroconversion of HBsAg to anti-HBs (i.e., during the window period). During this time, all HBsAgs and anti-HBs are in antigen-antibody complexes, so they cannot be detected in the serum. Immune clearance is established when additional unbound anti-HBs becomes detectable on serology.",

Moreover, current tobacco smoking, as seen in this patient, may decrease the risk of UC and have a positive effect on the course of the disease.

    "hint": "The patient has had flulike illness followed by agitation, confusion, hydrophobia, hypersalivation, and increased muscle tone and reflexes 2 months following exposure to raccoons. These symptoms are highly suggestive of rabies infection due to a bite by a raccoon, which are a major animal reservoir of rabies.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Administration of a chemically-inactivated virus (i.e., killed vaccine) along with rabies immunoglobulin is recommended as postexposure prophylaxis for patients exposed to suspected rabies. The immunoglobulin provides immediate protection by binding to the rabies virus and neutralizing it (i.e., passive immunity). However, protection is only temporary, since antibodies degrade over time. Simultaneous administration of the rabies vaccine stimulates the body's immune system, which reacts by producing antibodies (i.e., active immunity). Preventive active immunization with rabies vaccine is indicated for people with frequent occupational contact with potentially rabid animals and travelers to regions in which rabies is widespread.\n\nTreatment with postexposure prophylaxis in suspected cases of a rabid animal bite should take place immediately, as the disease is fatal once it has become symptomatic.

The risk of transmission is 80% to 90% from women seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBeAg. Mothers without the e antigen or with anti-HBe transmit the infection only in 5% to 20 % of cases.",

        "explanation_why": "Transaminases are usually normal or only mildly elevated in cases of vertical transmission of HBV. Because HBV is not cytopathic itself and newborns lack mature cytotoxic T-cells that mediate damage to infected hepatocytes, the degree of hepatic tissue damage will be limited. Rarely, infected neonates may develop acute hepatitis B.\n\nNewborns of mothers with unknown HBV status should receive vaccine within 12 hours of birth. If the mother tests positive for HBsAg, hepatitis B immune globulin should be administered as soon as possible. Newborns of HBsAg negative mothers should be given the hepatitis B vaccine series before hospital discharge.",

Women with HBV infection should be counseled that breastfeeding does not increase the likelihood of infection in their children. However, breastfeeding should be delayed until passive‑active postexposure prophylaxis has been given. Since, in this patient, vertical transmission of HBV has already occurred, there is no reason to delay breastfeeding.",

Deli meats, poultry, and unpasteurized milk (often used for soft cheeses) are common sources. Listeriosis typically manifests with fever, malaise, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, most commonly in the third trimester. It is associated with higher rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm birth. Congenital listeriosis occurs via transplacental transmission, while neonatal listeriosis occurs following either transplacental infection or inoculation at birth from contaminated vaginal secretions. Symptoms vary based on the route and timing of infection, ranging from minor, self-limiting illness to sepsis and death.",

An x-ray of the chest shows opacities in the lower lobe of the left lung. Treatment with ampicillin does not improve his symptoms.

Pneumonia together with this patient's gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea) and CNS symptoms (confusion) suggest Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by infection with Legionella pneumophila. This organism is a facultative intracellular bacillus that does not respond well to beta-lactam antibiotics and can be detected by specific urine antigen testing.",

Chronic mercury toxicity manifests with neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, erethism mercurialis (abnormal irritability), ataxia, and tremor. Various degrees of polyneuropathy may also be observed. Another common sign is gingival and/or buccal inflammation with a characteristic blue‑violet discoloration. This patient's history of working in a metal refinery further supports this diagnosis. Finally, treatment includes administering dimercaprol, a chelating agent used to reduce serum mercury levels. The chelating agents 2,3 dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) can also be used to lower mercury levels.\n\nLead poisoning would manifest with symptoms very similar to the ones in this case, including neuropsychiatric disturbances and anorexia. Dimercaprol is also the first-line treatment. However, this patient's prominent excess salivation, odynophagia, and gingival inflammation would not be expected in cases of lead poisoning.",

Chronic toxicity most often causes non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, chest pain, and headache. Neither acute nor chronic exposure cause gingivobuccal inflammation, tremor, or ataxia.

A root cause analysis is a retrospective analysis that is aimed at identifying a medical error that led to an adverse event, i.e., understanding who was affected by the event, what happened (identifying active errors), where it happened, when it happened, and why the event occurred (identifying latent errors). To identify latent errors that may have aligned to cause the adverse event, various factors are considered, such as the physical environment (e.g., the bed was malfunctioning and the patient could not be placed in the Trendelenburg position), team environment (e.g., a technician noticed that one of the catheter connections was detached but did not feel empowered to report her observation), regulatory pressures (e.g., the resident was rushing because he was at risk of exceeding duty hours), and patient-related factors (e.g., he was hypovolemic). Using the Swiss cheese model of error causation, the origins of the adverse event can be uncovered.\n\nA root cause analysis is performed after an event has occurred, and its purpose is to produce recommendations for interventions that prevent similar events from occurring in the future.",

        "explanation_why": "In preferred provider organizations, patients do not need to see a primary care physician before seeing a specialist. Because the insurance covers care delivered by out-of-network providers, monthly rates are generally very high. Additionally, patients are required to cover out-of-pocket costs for many aspects of care. Because this patient specifically mentioned she would like affordable monthly payments, a preferred provider organization would not be the appropriate recommendation for her.",

There is no coverage for visiting providers outside of the network. Other than in an emergency, seeing a provider outside of the patient's network means that the patients will have to pay the full cost of care themselves. Although monthly premiums are initially low for healthy patients, medical treatment for a serious illness that might develop later can be very costly.",

The primary care physician still acts as the gatekeeper for access to specialists.

This payment model is often used for reimbursement of inpatient services. For example, a hospital and payer can negotiate a fixed per diem rate for most routine inpatient services (e.g., common medical and surgical conditions) based on the average daily cost of admission. This model does not reflect the scenario described, in which health care providers receive a fixed amount for each patient enrolled over a specific period of time, regardless of whether or not services are provided.",

They are not paid a fixed amount for each patient enrolled over a specific period of time, regardless of the amount of care provided, as described in this case. Preferred provider organizations often use a discounted FFS payment model. As in a traditional FFS payment model, a discounted FFS payment model carries the risk that patients will be overtreated because compensation is based on the amount of service provided. However, because discounted prices are predetermined by negotiations between health care providers and payers, the financial incentive to provide excess care is decreased.",

Capitation incentivizes health care providers to promote efficient use of health care resources (e.g., cost-effective preventive health care to avoid larger downstream costs). Risks of capitation include provision of substandard care as a method of cost reduction and rejection of medically complex patients from patient panels by providers to reduce negative impacts on the ability to meet quality metrics.",

She has been in a monogamous relationship for 10 years. Menses occur at regular 30-day intervals and last 4 days with normal flow. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She did not receive the MMR vaccine when she was young because of an “egg allergy.” Her vaccinations are otherwise up-to-date. Her only medication is a daily folic acid supplement. She feels well today. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m^2. Temperature is 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse is 81/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 118/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. Her serum human chorionic gonadotropin concentration is 3 mIU/mL (N ≤ 5). An HIV antibody/antigen test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "As part of comprehensive preconception care, physicians should assess individuals' immunization status and recommend all routine age-appropriate immunizations. Because of the risk of congenital abnormalities following infection with rubella or varicella in pregnancy, the MMR and varicella vaccines are especially recommended. In patients with no evidence of immunity to rubella (e.g., those who did not receive the MMR vaccine), rubella antibody testing should be used to screen for immunity, and vaccination should be recommended in individuals without immunity. The MMR and varicella vaccines are live vaccines, which are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential risk of infection in the birthing parent and consequent vertical transmission. Accordingly, conception should be avoided for 1–3 months after immunization.\n\nIn the past, administering the MMR vaccine to children with egg allergies raised concerns because of residual egg proteins in the vaccine. However, the MMR vaccine is currently considered safe for children with egg allergy.",

Screening tests for HBV infection are indicated for asymptomatic patients who have a high risk for previous HBV exposure. This population includes people who were born in countries with high HBV prevalence, such as the Philippines (and all countries in Asia). Accordingly, this patient should undergo serologic testing for HBV, which includes the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (anti-HBs).\n\nOther populations that should receive screening for HBV infection include women who are pregnant, patients who receive immunosuppressive therapy, blood donors, and children with mothers who have HBV infection.",

In medicine, the availability bias typically occurs when a physician picks a diagnosis that comes to mind easily and quickly, e.g., when several patients with a similar clinical presentation were recently diagnosed with a certain condition.

    "question_text": "An infectious disease chairperson of a large hospital determines that the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infections at the hospital is too high. She proposes an initiative to restrict the usage of clindamycin in the hospital to determine if that lowers the incidence of C. difficile infections. She puts in place a requirement that an infectious disease fellow needs to approve any prescription of clindamycin. After 2 months, she reviews the hospital infection data and determines that the incidence of C. difficile infections has decreased, but not to the extent that she had hoped. Consequently, she decides to include fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the antibiotic restriction and examine the data again in another 2 months. Which of the following best describes the process being used by the infectious disease chairperson?",

The “Plan” phase consists of defining an area that needs improvement and planning potential interventions to bring about a corrective change (e.g., determining that the incidence of C. difficile infections at the hospital is too high and proposing an initiative to restrict the usage of clindamycin). The “Do” phase consists of testing the intervention (e.g., requiring that an infectious disease fellow approve any prescription of clindamycin for a 2-month period). The “Study” phase consists of assessing the impact of the intervention on the quality of healthcare (e.g., reviewing the hospital infection data). The “Act” phase consists of implementing the new intervention if the previous test showed a positive impact on healthcare quality (e.g., implementing the clindamycin restriction long-term) or restarting the cycle if the results were negative or had no significant impact (e.g., including fluoroquinolones in the antibiotic restriction).",

He is diagnosed with a thrombotic stroke and treatment with aspirin is initiated. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study is performed to determine his ability to swallow safely; he is found to be at increased risk of aspiration. Consequently, he is ordered not to have any food or liquids by mouth. A Dobhoff feeding tube is placed, tube feedings are ordered, and the patient starts receiving tube feedings. Shortly after, he develops a cough and dyspnea. An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the right lower lobe and that the end of the Dobhoff tube is in his right lung instead of his stomach. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this medical error from occurring?",

The surgeon, surgical physician assistant, anesthesiologist, circulating nurse, and operating room technician have worked together as an effective team for years. Experience has shown that they are all willing and able to voice any concerns they may have to other members of the team. The anesthesiologist verifies the patient's name and date of birth. After general anesthesia is administered, the circulating nurse initiates a discussion among the surgeon, surgical physician assistant, anesthesiologist, and operating room technician. Each person actively communicates and agrees on the patient's identity, the surgical site, and the procedure. The circulating nurse then documents their conversation, and the surgeon marks the surgical site with his initials. The initial incision is made and the surgery is performed. In the recovery room, the patient's wife asks the recovery room nurse why the bandaging is on her husband's left hip when his right hip was supposed to be operated on. A failure to perform which of the following actions most likely contributed to the error that occurred in this scenario?",

Effective interprofessional communication was demonstrated in this scenario, as communication was initiated by the circulating nurse and involved the active contribution and agreement of all other members of the operating team.

In this scenario, the surgeon correctly marked what he believed to be the surgical site with his initials.

The Universal Protocol, which is used to prevent wrong-site surgery, is a three-step process based on the human factors engineering strategy of redundancy and the Swiss cheese model for error prevention:\n\n1. preprocedural verification of the patient's identity, surgical site, and surgical procedure;\n2. surgical site marking;\n3. performing a time-out.\n\nThe third step should take place in the operating room before the first incision and was performed correctly in this scenario. However, the first two steps should take place before the induction of anesthesia, in the preoperative or holding area, and, whenever possible, the patient should be actively involved. For operations in which wrong-site surgery is a concern (e.g., hip surgery), only the correct surgical site should be marked by writing the word “YES,” the attending surgeon's initials, or both using an indelible marker. Marking may be performed by the surgeon after verbal confirmation from the patient or by the patient directly in front of the surgeon, but the site marking protocol should be standardized for each institution.",

        "explanation_why": "Using two unique patient identifiers before initiating any medical procedure is a crucial safety measure that helps prevent patient misidentification errors. In this scenario, the anesthesiologist used the patient's name and date of birth as identifiers, thereby fulfilling this requirement. The error that occurred in this scenario was wrong-site surgery rather than patient misidentification, which suggests that failure to perform a different safety measure contributed to the error.",

The night shift resident physician obtains informed consent for the procedure and adds the patient's request to the patient's electronic chart. The next morning, the night shift resident, who has been at the hospital for 22 hours, forgets to update the gynecologic resident covering the day shift with this information. The surgical nurse only recently started working at the hospital. The surgical team does not review the added note in the patient's chart before the procedure. Cesarean delivery is carried out by the gynecologic resident along with an attending physician without complications, but the postpartum tubal ligation is not performed.

In this case, the surgical team failed to review the patient’s medical record, which contained the note about postpartum tubal ligation. Moreover, the resident physician covering the night shift failed to communicate the additional intervention to the gynecologic resident. Measures to prevent communication-related errors include the implementation of standardized handoffs, the use of standardized medical terminology and abbreviations in documentation, signouts, read-backs, timeouts, a safety culture, flat authority gradients, and teamwork training.",

    "question_text": "A 68-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of worsening shortness of breath. She has hypertension treated with lisinopril. Crackles are heard at both lower lung fields. She is diagnosed with acute congestive heart failure. When the physician responsible for the patient's care enters intravenous furosemide in the patient's orders, a clinical decision support system message appears on the computer saying that furosemide in combination with lisinopril may result in significant hypotension and decreased kidney function. The message also has a recommendation for dose adjustment and more frequent monitoring of vital signs and electrolytes when the patient is on both medications. The physician does not follow the recommendation and dismisses the message as one of the many inconsequential warnings that he encounters during his work. Two days after admission, the patient develops dizziness, severe hypotension, and chest pain. She is transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit and diagnosed with type 2 myocardial infarction secondary to hypotension. It is determined that a medication error occurred and personnel interviews are performed as part of a root cause analysis. These interviews reveal that the physician responsible for the patient's care has to take care of several complicated cases during the course of his shift and he has a high level of engagement with patients and a strong sense of personal accomplishment from his work. A fishbone diagram is most likely to reveal which of the following as the root cause of the error that occurred in this scenario?",

Although computerized alerts were created to improve patient safety, the high number of alarms encountered has led healthcare personnel to become desensitized to such warnings. This desensitization is worsened by the high proportion of alarms that are clinically inconsequential. As a result, physicians often ignore these warnings or do not react appropriately. In turn, as physicians start to ignore both meaningless and critical alarms, there are negative implications for patient safety because medical errors occur, like the one seen here where the physician ignored a computerized clinical alarm regarding a drug interaction.",

In this case, as the physician determined that the patient received ten times the prescribed dose, the transcribing error was most likely due to the misinterpretation of a trailing zero after a decimal point. Trailing zeros are part of the Joint Commission's “Do Not Use” list, which provides recommendations on information management. To prevent transcribing errors, most hospitals have adopted computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, which also have the advantage of helping to prevent ordering errors because they are usually combined with a clinical decision support system. If a CPOE system has not been adopted and the health care facility maintains a paper-based system, the usage of standardized abbreviations/writing styles and having an intermediary (like a clinical pharmacist or a pharmacy technician) read and interpret the prescriptions can also help to prevent transcribing errors.",

He has nontremor-dominant Parkinson disease that was diagnosed at the age of 68 after developing progressive bradykinesia and rigidity. He lives alone following the death of his wife 2 years ago. The patient's son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren live nearby and help him with daily activities. Current medications include levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. He appears well. Neurologic examination shows mild hypomimia, bradydiadochokinesia, shortened steps, and mild gait shuffling. During the examination, the patient mentions that he drove himself to his appointment today because he does not want to feel like a burden on his son. The physician is concerned that the patient's illness and medications potentially impair his driving skills. The patient stresses that he has never had an accident in his life and is a very safe driver. He also states that he has felt isolated since his wife's passing and likes to meet up with old friends at a local bar. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "A physician should encourage patients to communicate with their family members and seek help when necessary. However, it is inappropriate for the physician to presume that the patient's son would be willing to drive for the patient. The physician should instead explore the patient's reasons for feeling like a burden on his son, rather than simply instructing him not to feel this way. Moreover, in this case, it is critical to inform the patient that his current condition impairs his ability to drive safely; a different reaction would, therefore, be appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Irrespective of state laws, if a physician believes that a patient cannot drive safely, the physician must share their concerns with the patient and ask them to stop driving until they have been evaluated and treated by a driver rehabilitation specialist. Alternatively, the patient can be recleared for driving by the state licensing authority (e.g., Department of Motor Vehicles). However, the laws for reporting impaired drivers differ between states.\n\nMost states have voluntary reporting laws, under which a physician is not required to disclose a patient's driving impairment to the state licensing authority but are protected from a breach of patient confidentiality if they do so. Some states have mandatory reporting laws, which require physicians to report any patient with driving impairment to the state licensing authority. In states with voluntary or mandatory reporting laws, the physician can be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not report the driving impairment. A few states do not have any reporting laws and require the physician to obtain the patient's consent before disclosing driving impairment to the authorities. In these states, the physician cannot be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not have consent to disclose driver impairment.",

        "explanation_why": "Critical test results, which require an immediate review by a physician (e.g., high PT/INR, derangements in potassium levels), can be labeled as “urgent” in order to bring these results to the attention of the caregiver sooner and thereby help prevent a delay in follow-up. However, this measure can only be implemented successfully by trained personnel (e.g., physicians, laboratory technicians, nurses); office front staff are not trained to identify critical test results; if they are instructed to label all abnormal test results as “urgent,” alert fatigue can occur and cause the physician to ignore the “urgent” label.",

        "explanation_why": "Standardization of protocols for the follow-up of test results (e.g., maintaining a record of therapeutic drug monitoring tests that need to be reviewed, or a record of tests with pending results) can help prevent medical errors that occur as a result of a delay in follow-up by the physician. Protocols help ensure a consistent level of quality and increase efficiency (e.g., reduce the variation in follow-up time and increase the likelihood of the physician reviewing critical test results as soon as they arrive). By using a standardized protocol, the physician would have been notified that the patient's INR was too high earlier, could have adjusted the warfarin dose in time, and thereby have prevented the anal bleeding.\n\nFurther examples of standardization include the introduction of checklists and guidelines as well as standardized equipment and terminology.",

However, several patient-related factors (e.g., lack of internet access, low literacy level, low motivation, inability to interpret test results), and design-related factors (e.g., poor ease-of-use) can limit the usefulness of these portals. Moreover, this step does not address the physician's responsibility to follow up on the patient's results in a timely manner and lays this responsibility squarely on the patient.",

Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest.",

        "explanation_why": "Screening recommendations in the context of cancer susceptibility due to BRCA mutations vary. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women with a personal history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or with a positive family history for these types of cancer undergo familial risk assessment with a standardized questionnaire (e.g., Ontario Family History Assessment Tool, referral screening tool for ovarian cancer). Risk factors for ovarian cancer evaluated by the risk assessment tools include personal or family history of ovarian, breast cancer, and certain other types of cancer (e.g., bowel cancer), age at diagnosis, number of relatives affected, and Ashkenazi Jewish descent. If the result of the risk assessment tool is positive, genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing for BRCA mutations should follow.\n\nScreening for ovarian cancer is not routinely recommended for women who do not have a personal or family history of the above-mentioned types of cancer because of a lack of evidence that supports such screening. Patients who are known BRCA mutation carriers and do not wish to undergo preventive bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be offered periodic screening for ovarian cancer (e.g., annual transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 levels).",

This model does not reflect the scenario described here, in which the organization is compensated a fixed amount for the entire clinically defined episode of care. A per diem payment model is often used for the reimbursement of inpatient services and can provide a perverse incentive for prolonging the duration of hospital stay.",

Capitation incentivizes health care providers to promote efficient use of health care resources (e.g., cost-effective preventive health care to avoid larger downstream costs) and increases accountability and transparency through reporting of quality metrics. Risks of capitation include provision of substandard care as a method of cost reduction and rejection of medically complex patients from patient panels by providers to reduce negative impacts on the ability to meet quality metrics.",

This payment model incentivizes cost-effective provision of care and increases accountability and transparency through reporting of quality metrics.

This means that more resources will be directed to the individuals who need them the most and patients will be spared from undergoing unnecessary procedures that may be more harmful than beneficial. For example, this patient, who underwent a total hysterectomy, is no longer at risk for cervical cancer and therefore does not require further Pap smears or screening for human papillomavirus. One way of improving resource stewardship is the lean process improvement method, in which factors that use time, energy, and resources but do not improve patient outcomes (also referred to as “waste”) are continuously identified and eliminated.",

Although PID is most often asymptomatic, it can result in severe complications, including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, both the USPSTF and CDC recommend annual screening with a nucleic acid amplification test for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active women < 25 years and women ≥ 25 years with certain risk factors (e.g., new or multiple sex partners, a sex partner with an STI). The CDC also recommends annual screening for both sexually active HIV-positive men and men who have sex with men because of the higher incidence of gonorrhea and chlamydia infections in these populations. Routine chlamydia and gonorrhea screening is not currently recommended for sexually active, HIV-negative men in monogamous, heterosexual relationships, such as this patient.",

Prostate cancer screening is most commonly performed using a serum prostate-specific antigen test every 2 years. Screening can be initiated earlier at 40 years for patients with a first-degree relative who developed early-onset prostate cancer (i.e., before 65 years). This 42-year-old patient with a second-degree relative who developed prostate cancer at the age of 73 years does not require prostate cancer screening at this visit.",

Since this patient is currently at 30 weeks' gestation and all of her previous prenatal visits were normal, the likelihood of her having GDM is very low. Therefore, discontinuing further prenatal care is unlikely to increase the risk of macrosomia in this fetus.",

        "explanation_why": "Neonatal sepsis can result from infection with Group B streptococcus (GBS), which colonizes the maternal genital tract in 15–40% of pregnant women. Transmission to the fetus can occur after the rupture of membranes or during labor (i.e., passage through the birth canal). Therefore, prenatal screening for GBS is performed in all pregnant women between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation via culture and gram staining of vaginal and rectal swabs. If this patient refuses further prenatal screening after 30 weeks' gestation, she will not be screened for GBS, thus increasing her child's risk of neonatal sepsis. Moreover, GBS can lead to urinary tract infections, cystitis, pyelonephritis, and chorioamnionitis during pregnancy, all of which can be avoided by screening and treatment. Patients with a positive screening test for GBS should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis with IV penicillin G or ampicillin.",

Rh incompatibility is more likely to cause severe symptoms in the newborn. Therefore, screening Rh-negative mothers for anti-D antibodies takes place at the initial prenatal visit with further anti-D antibody testing at 28 weeks' gestation. Since this patient is already at 30 weeks of gestation and all of her previous prenatal visits showed no abnormalities, discontinuing prenatal visits at this point would not increase the risk of HDFN.",

She also developed mild nausea and decreased appetite during the last 4 weeks. She has not seen a physician in several years; her immunization records are unavailable. Her menstrual cycle is irregular, and she does not recall when her last menstrual period was. She drinks two to three beers daily and occasionally smokes cigarettes. She has several male sexual partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 71/min, and blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m^2. Pelvic examination shows a group of small vesicles on an erythematous base over the labia majora and minora with tender, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Ultrasonography discloses an intrauterine pregnancy consistent with 14 weeks' gestation with no detectable heartbeat. The fetal cranial vault is absent, there is no visible brain tissue, and there is mild polyhydramnios. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented the defect in this fetus?",

In the setting of increased metabolic demand from pregnancy, folate supplementation is often necessary to prevent deficiency, which can result in NTDs (e.g., spina bifida, meningomyelocele, encephalocele, anencephaly). This patient's lack of prenatal care resulted in folate deficiency and subsequent fetal anencephaly. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends daily supplementation of 0.4–0.8 mg oral folic acid for all individuals capable of pregnancy for at least ≥ 4 weeks before trying to conceive, and supplementation should be continued until 12 weeks' gestation.",

He is in his junior year at a local high school and lives with his parents and his older sister. Vital signs are within normal limits. Genitourinary examination shows yellow-green urethral discharge. The testes are symmetrical without tenderness or masses. A diagnosis of gonococcal infection is made. The patient requests treatment. The physician informs the patient that antibiotic therapy will be necessary. He encourages the patient to talk to his parents, but the patient says that he does not wish to inform them about the infection. When the physician asks the patient about his reasons for not wanting to do so, the patient says “They don't even know about my boyfriend and would be extremely angry if they found out. Would you be able to prescribe me antibiotics without informing my parents?” Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "Laws regarding consent in adolescent health care differ by state, but all states allow minors to consent to the evaluation and management of addiction and care related to sexual behavior (e.g., STIs, contraception, pregnancy); parental consent is not required. This patient does not want his parents to know that he is sexually active or has an STI. Accordingly, the physician is ethically and legally obliged to keep his medical information confidential from his parents (although minors should, in general, be counseled to have open discussions about health with their parents or legal guardians). However, since Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is a reportable disease, the physician is required to report the case to a public health official. Ideally, all of the patient's sexual partners within the past 60 days should be informed (either by the patient or by the public health official, but not by the physician!), evaluated for gonococcal infection, and treated if positive. Alternatively, the physician could provide expedited partner therapy (EPT), especially if the likelihood of follow-up is low.\n\nIntramuscular injection of ceftriaxone is used both for targeted and empirical therapy for gonococcal infection. If chlamydial coinfection is present or has not been ruled out, oral doxycycline is added. If EPT is required, a single dose of oral cefixime can be administered instead of ceftriaxone. If chlamydial infection is present or has not been excluded in the patient's partner, doxycycline (preferred) or azithromycin should be added.",

Lifestyle modifications can be initiated with or without pharmacotherapy, as not all patients with high blood pressure require antihypertensive drugs right away. The decision of whether to initiate pharmacological treatment depends on the patient's blood pressure, comorbidities, and preference. This patient wishes to avoid pharmacological therapy.",

        "explanation_why": "Weight loss is an effective way to reduce blood pressure in overweight and obese patients. Systolic blood pressure is thought to rise in obesity because of peripheral insulin resistance, which results in hyperinsulinemia, triggering increased reabsorption of sodium and fluid. Approximately 1 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure is expected for every 1 kg of weight loss. This patient, however, has a normal body weight and would most likely benefit from a different lifestyle modification at this time.",

The previously recommended age to start screening was 50 years. Colonoscopy every 10 years is an appropriate strategy. Because this patient had his last colonoscopy 8 years ago, which was normal, and lacks symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (e.g., weight loss, hematochezia), a colonoscopy is not indicated at this time.",

Screening may be considered in patients with genetic conditions associated with a higher incidence of intracranial aneurysms (e.g., autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and in patients with first-degree relatives with a history of intracranial aneurysms, neither of which is seen here.",

Asymptomatic bacteriuria does not usually result in symptomatic infection, so the USPSTF recommends against this screening in nonpregnant adults.

In young women, HPV infections tend to be transient and resolve without treatment, and testing in this age group results in a considerable false-positive rate, which can lead to unnecessary invasive procedures (e.g., cervical biopsy, loop excision, conization). In women younger than 21 years old, such as this patient, the USPSTF recommends against cervical cancer screening as the harms outweigh the benefits.",

N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections are often asymptomatic in women but can result in complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Screening consists of nucleic acid amplification tests of the urine, which have both high sensitivity and specificity for these infections. Although there is not a defined screening interval, it is reasonable to annually repeat the screening in women with new or persistent risk factors.",

Some of these procedures increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm delivery). Because evidence shows that the harms of cervical cancer screening in women younger than 21 years of age outweigh the benefits, the USPSTF recommends against screening in this age group.",

This patient's positive family history is also a risk factor for developing RA. However, RA typically manifests with symmetrical pain and swelling of metacarpophalangeal and/or proximal interphalangeal joints; unilateral involvement of foot joints is very rare.

These changes are an important cause of morbidity in patients with diabetes because they usually result in complications like diabetic foot ulcers and foot deformities, including Charcot foot. Regular foot examination should be routinely performed on every patient with diabetes to assess for possible complications (e.g., ulcers, deformities) or possible risk factors for complications (e.g., poor nail care, infections, calluses, inappropriate footwear) and must include inspection, monofilament testing, and assessment of pedal pulses. Regular monofilament testing allows the early detection of diabetic neuropathy and thereby reduces the likelihood of further complications.",

She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Her current medication includes metformin, enalapril, and aspirin. She has brought laboratory results from a screening examination performed 2 weeks ago prior to donating blood. Laboratory studies from the blood bank show a nonreactive HIV-1/2 combination immunoassay and a nonreactive HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. While reviewing the patient's chart, the physician notices that an HIV-1/2 combination immunoassay, which was performed at last year's office visit by a colleague, was reactive. During the consultation, the physician realizes that the patient is not aware of the results of the HIV test that was performed a year ago. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

To help reduce the risk of future errors, the clinician should encourage their colleague to report the incident using standard protocol. Most medical errors are caused by failures in health care systems, and incident reporting can contribute to the identification and improvement of systemic issues. If there is no longer a patient-physician relationship with the colleague, the clinician must comply with HIPAA regulations by initially obtaining the patient’s permission to contact the physician.\n\nAdditionally, the clinician should inform the patient of the previous test result and discuss its implications, ensuring transparency and prioritizing care. In this scenario, the patient does not have HIV, and no further testing is needed.",

His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination shows tenderness, erythema, and warmth at the surgical wound, with purulent discharge from the incision. Results of initial wound cultures are pending. The patient is diagnosed with a surgical site infection (SSI) and empiric antibiotic treatment is started. The physician on duty recalls that she saw a different patient with similar symptoms earlier this week, and she decides to look at the hospital statistics for SSI incidence. She notes that at least five patients developed SSI in the pediatric unit during the last month and that all of them received a lower dose of preoperative cefazolin than is recommended by current guidelines. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to prevent recurrence of such a mistake in the future?",

In this case, the error has already occurred.

The first step of this method is the identification of the medical error (e.g., lower dose of preoperative cefazolin administered than is recommended by current guidelines), followed by the investigation of individual factors (sharp-end errors) and systemic factors (blunt-end errors) that contributed to the error (e.g., through a fishbone diagram of causes leading to patients developing SSI). After this, possible measures for the prevention (e.g., staff education on new policies) are determined. The final step in an RCA is the implementation of these measures.",

In this case, the association between the exposure (receiving a lower dose of preoperative antibiotics) and the outcome (SSI) could be studied retrospectively in two cohorts (i.e., exposed and not exposed). This analysis would help determine whether there is an association between receiving low dose antibiotics and developing an SSI, and could be an important step in evaluating what went wrong. However, this method does not address the question of how to prevent similar errors in the future, so a different analysis would be more appropriate.",

In this scenario, an RCT would likely require half the doctors to use pagers and the other half to use smartphones. The outcomes on patient care and medical error would then be compared in the two groups. RCTs are considered the gold standard for clinical trials. However, RCTs are costly and time-consuming. Additionally, RCTs involve the practical implementation of an intervention that could potentially be harmful to the patient. This study design would therefore expose patients to the real risks of a smartphone system, and not just evaluate for potential risks.",

This analysis could be done to review the results of previous studies of smartphone systems in hospitals.

In this specific scenario, an FMEA would explore any potential security and privacy breaches that might take place when using smartphones for internal communication (failure mode). After that, the reasons for failure (failure causes) and the outcomes of potential failures (failure effects) would be identified.

She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and constipation. Her current medication includes valsartan, salmeterol, and a fiber supplement for constipation. She entered menopause last year. Four years ago, she underwent hemorrhoidectomy; a sigmoidoscopy at that time showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 66 years; the patient's last mammogram from 6 months ago was normal. Her last primary HPV test taken 3 years ago was negative. She does not drink alcohol. She smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years but quit 8 years ago when she was diagnosed with COPD. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows varicose veins in the lower extremities. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable for her age. Which of the following screening studies is most appropriate at this time?",

Screening recommendations for former smokers vary. Although the American Cancer Society supports screening regardless of time since last smoked, some organizations (e.g., USPSTF) recommend limiting screening to individuals who have smoked within the past 15 years.\n\nSee “Screening for cancer” and “Screening recommendations for nonpregnant women by age” tables.",

The previously recommended age to start screening was 50 years. Sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is an appropriate strategy. Because this patient had her last sigmoidoscopy 4 years ago, which was normal, and lacks symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (e.g., weight loss, hematochezia), sigmoidoscopy is not indicated at this time.",

She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Preadmission medications include candesartan, salmeterol, budesonide, and pravastatin. Upon admission, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated because she was unconscious. Over the past 12 hours, her end-expiratory airway pressure was increased to ensure adequate oxygenation. Her current temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 114/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 140/92 mm Hg. An x-ray of the chest shows new alveolar infiltrates and air bronchograms in the right lower lobe. Which of the following measures is most likely to have prevented this patient's current condition?",

    "hint": "Tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and new infiltrates on chest x-ray after being intubated for more than 48 hours indicate ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is most often caused by microaspiration of bacterial flora from the oral cavity or stomach.",

Therefore, a change in the ventilator circuit is recommended if it is visibly soiled, malfunctioning, or if a new patient is ventilated. However, frequent changes of the ventilator circuit for the same patient increase rather than decrease the risk of VAP because manipulation of the ventilator circuit increases the risk of microaspiration of subglottic secretions.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Sedatives are used in mechanically ventilated patients to relieve discomfort and anxiety and, if a spontaneous ventilatory mode is unavailable, to prevent complications arising from patient-ventilator asynchrony. However, excessive sedation impairs the patient's airway protective reflexes and allows oropharyngeal secretions or gastric reflux to pass beyond the glottis. In intubated patients, these collections can pool in the subglottic region and drain around the endotracheal tube cuff, as microaspirates, into the lower respiratory tract. Using sedation assessment tools and daily titration of the patient's depth of sedation to the minimum necessary level (sedation vacation) can prevent the subglottic pooling of secretions and subsequent VAP. Sedation vacations also prevent VAP by facilitating spontaneous breathing trials and early ventilator weaning.\n\nVAP can also be prevented by measures that decrease oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal bacterial colonization (e.g., oral chlorhexidine rinses, avoiding unnecessary acid suppression therapy), decrease subglottic pooling (e.g., oropharyngeal and subglottic suctioning, semirecumbent positioning of the patient), and decrease the risk of microaspiration (e.g., minimizing patient transport, avoiding frequent ventilator circuit changes for the same patient).",

While avoiding overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff prevents airway injury (e.g., ischemia, ulceration, and necrosis of the tracheal wall), it does not prevent VAP.",

A physician notices that the average hemoglobin A_1C of patients with diabetes mellitus and limited English proficiency in the hospital is significantly higher when compared to patients proficient in English. The hospital conducts an inpatient study, which finds a statistically significant correlation between scores on a standardized verbal English proficiency test and scores on standardized medication adherence scales and patient-physician concordance scales. Based on the results of a subsequent root cause analysis, the hospital management renegotiates health care payment contracts with their insurance provider to allow for reimbursement of professional medical interpreter services.

A code is called and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is initiated. Despite several cycles of CPR, the patient dies. A medicolegal autopsy reveals a massive pulmonary embolism and hemorrhage within the pons, thalami, and putamen. A subsequent investigation reveals that, during CPR, a health care provider in the code team administered boluses from a prefilled syringe containing 1:1000 epinephrine, which is used for intramuscular injections in the case of anaphylaxis, instead of the 1:10,000 preparation, which is used for intravenous boluses in the case of cardiac arrest. Which of the following actions at the hospital is most likely to prevent repeat incidents of this medication error?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "In this scenario, the medication error occurred at the stage of administration; the patient received the wrong dose via the intravenous route and subsequently suffered a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The action hierarchy of human factors engineering (HFE) categorizes actions aimed at preventing medical errors into stronger, intermediate, and weaker actions, depending on how much they rely on human effort.",

        "explanation_why": "This action is an example of a forcing function, which is considered a stronger action according to the action hierarchy of HFE. The storage of 1:1000 preparations of epinephrine (only used in anaphylaxis and for intramuscular injection) in epinephrine autoinjectors guarantees the correct route of administration of this highly concentrated epinephrine preparation. This forcing function would have prevented the medication error that resulted in a lethal complication in this scenario (i.e., a never event) by making it impossible to administer this epinephrine preparation via the intravascular route.\n\nOther examples of forcing functions include design features that only allow one health care record to be open on a computerized physician order entry system to prevent wrong-patient errors and providing different hub fits for intravenous injections of high-risk medications (e.g., opiates) to prevent administration of the wrong drug.",

It is intended for intramuscular injection into the anterolateral thigh in the case of anaphylaxis.The autoinjector is stored in a carrier tube (not shown in this image). The blue safety release cap requires removing before application. The orange tip is then jabbed firmly into the anterolateral thigh to release the needle (until it clicks) and held in place for 3 seconds to allow the injection to complete.",

He appears well and has no history of serious illness.

He discloses the error to the patient and reports the error to the hospital's event reporting system. Since the hospital was opened 1 year ago, the hospital management has received several reports of physicians inadvertently overlooking important clinical information in patient records, clinical deterioration of admitted patients following missed changes in vital signs, laboratory test results being issued for wrong patients, and patients accidentally receiving incorrect drug doses.

        "explanation_why": "Documentation errors caused by copying and pasting information in electronic health records (EHRs) are the most likely common source of the medical errors described here. EHRs, which were increasingly adopted following the HITECH Act of 2009, have several advantages (e.g., transparency, high fidelity) but also create the possibility for certain errors. The copy/paste function may result in the entry of incorrect or outdated information or the entry of information into the wrong patient's EHR, and subsequently lead to errors such as incorrect drug dosing, performing tests or treatment on the wrong patient, and billing for services that were never performed. Duplicating information also promotes “note bloat,” the proliferation of lengthy notes that include redundant, nonessential information, which may lead to physicians overlooking important facts. The unchecked transfer of outdated patient data, such as previous vital signs, can lead to the deterioration of patients due to missed changes in their condition.\n\nForcing functions on workstations such as allowing only one EHR to be open at a time, clipboard clearing, and disabling copy/paste functionality in certain parts of the EHR can prevent these errors. Other measures to improve safety with EHR use include the implementation of standardized protocols (e.g., SAFER guide) and personnel training.",

Duplex ultrasonography and CT angiography of the carotid arteries had shown an 80% stenosis on the right and 50% stenosis on the left. A shared decision to perform right-sided carotid endarterectomy was made with consent from the patient's medical power of attorney, and the management plan was documented in the patient records as “CEA right.” The surgical intern meets the patient on the ward on the day of surgery and, using a permanent marker, circles the surgical site and marks “X” on the nonsurgical site. The patient is brought to the operating room and the circulating nurse confirms that all relevant patient documents and findings are available. While the surgical team is scrubbing, the anesthetist asks the patient to verify her surgery site by pointing to it. Regional anesthesia is performed, and the patient is draped. The surgery is subsequently performed without any complications. While filling out the signout checklist after the surgery, the circulating nurse notices that the surgery was performed on the left carotid artery instead of the right. Which of the following actions would most likely have prevented this never event?",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "The Universal Protocol should be followed to prevent never events such as wrong-site surgery. This protocol consists of a series of steps based on the human factors engineering strategy of redundancy and standardization and should be performed before invasive medical procedures. In this scenario, the surgeon did not follow the protocol for one of these steps correctly and a subsequent step was missed entirely. If this subsequent step had been performed, it could have reduced the likelihood of the error occurring by acting as an additional safety measure (i.e., a Swiss cheese model).",

Marking may be performed by the attending surgeon after verbal confirmation from the patient, although it is acceptable to delegate to another person who will also be present during the procedure (e.g., the surgical intern in this scenario), or by the patient directly in front of the surgeon, but the site marking protocol should be standardized for each institution.",

        "explanation_why": "The Universal Protocol is a three-step process:\n\n1. preprocedural verification of the patient's identity, the surgical site, and the surgical procedure;\n2. surgical site marking;\n3. performing a time-out.\n\nA surgical time-out is performed in the operating room prior to the procedure to reconfirm the patient's identity, the procedure, and the surgical site. The time-out is typically initiated by a designated member of the team, such as the circulating nurse, and involves all of the team members (e.g., operating room technicians, principal surgeon, medical students) who are participating in the procedure. The whole team is responsible for reviewing all of the relevant information through active communication, and once everyone is in agreement, the time-out should be documented. A successful time-out requires a safety culture, which provides an environment in which health care providers can actively speak up about potential errors.\n\nThe protocol for surgical site marking was also not followed correctly in this scenario. When marking the surgical site, the correct site should be marked by writing the word “YES”, the surgeon's initials, or both using an indelible marker. The incorrect surgical site should not be marked; this includes marking with the word “NO” or an ambiguous visual cue (e.g., an “X” could also be interpreted as an indicator of the correct site).",

Therefore, adhesive tape is not recommended because it can easily be rubbed off or transferred to a different site, which can result in wrong-site surgery.",

    "question_text": "The event reporting system of a hospital logs three incidents of electrothermal injury to patients during surgical procedures over a 1-week period. The surgical team notices that these adverse events began shortly after the introduction of new electrocautery devices in the operating rooms. The new devices are a different brand than the ones used previously and were procured by the hospital management using a transparent tendering process as a replacement for some of the old electrocautery devices that had started to malfunction. The staff have been using electrocautery devices for a long time and did not report any incidents of electrothermal injuries with the old brand of electrocautery devices. A root cause analysis reveals that adverse events primarily occurred because the alarms of the new devices were too loud and distracting, and the surgical staff would occasionally turn down the alarm volume. Implementation of which of the following measures before introducing the new electrocautery device in the operating rooms would most likely have prevented the electrothermal injuries?",

The elimination of distraction is considered an “intermediate-level action” in preventing medical errors according to the action hierarchy of HFE. However, general noise reduction would not have prevented the adverse effects in this case, since the alarm signals of the electrocautery device could still have been turned down even if the general noise level was already decreased.",

New devices can be evaluated based on whether they meet the users' requirements (design validation) regarding the intended purpose and usability. In the action hierarchy of HFE, this method of error prevention is considered a “stronger action,” meaning that it is more effective in preventing medical errors since it does not rely on human effort for error mitigation compared to “weaker actions” such as training, double checks, warnings, and the introduction of new policies (e.g., checking the alarm volume hourly). Another example of a “stronger action” is the implementation of a forcing function, e.g., a design feature that switches off the electrocautery device if the volume falls below a certain level.",

She observes that these referrals for imaging and the subsequent follow-up take up a large amount of the HMO's annual budget, which is primarily financed by a capitation reimbursement model. With the aim of decreasing the number of imaging referrals, she decides to purchase a validated computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) that uses evidence-based clinical decision rules to assist physicians in determining whether a patient with low back pain requires imaging. A failure mode and effects analysis is conducted for the CDSS and anticipated barriers to using the CDSS are addressed.

    "hint": "The first phase (i.e., the \"Plan\" phase) of the PDSA cycle consists of preparing a new process or tool (e.g., a CDSS), identifying a quality improvement (QI) measure (e.g., the number of imaging referrals), and establishing a goal for the effect of the new process or tool (e.g., a decrease in the number of imaging referrals).",

        "explanation_why": "It is not necessary to obtain informed consent before implementing the “Plan” phase of a PDSA cycle so long as the proposed plan does not deviate from the accepted standard of care. Avoiding unnecessary imaging and workup and the use of evidence-based clinical decision rules to assist in risk assessment are part of the standard of care. Physicians need to obtain informed consent before performing diagnostic procedures but do not need to obtain informed consent in order to use a validated CDSS as a decision-making guide.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "The need for a backup plan (contingency) for QI is guided by the Pareto principle: A backup plan is indicated if the initial plan achieves at least 80% of a predicted QI measure and then fails to achieve significant further improvements. A backup plan should not be prepared or implemented prematurely because doing so can lead to wasteful resource utilization and increase the risk of unnecessarily abandoning the first plan. In this scenario, the effect of the CDSS should be measured and analyzed before preparing a backup plan.",

        "explanation_why": "The PDSA cycle is a model for rapid and continuous QI. In this scenario, the \"Plan\" phase has been completed, so the most appropriate next step is the \"Do\" phase, i.e., implementing the CDSS for a specified time frame and collecting both qualitative data (e.g., observations from frontline workers on unanticipated problems) and quantitative data (e.g., number of imaging referrals). In the first PDSA cycle, the plan is often implemented on a small scale to ensure the intervention is appropriately tested (e.g., implementing the CDSS with a cohort of physicians before implementing it throughout the HMO). At the end of the specified time frame, the “Study” phase begins. The collected data is analyzed using run charts and control charts to see if the plan had the expected effect on the QI measure, and conclusions are made. In the “Act” phase, changes to the plan are proposed if the desired effect was not achieved or unanticipated problems occurred. If the plan achieved the desired effect, preparations are made for implementation on a larger scale. The cycle is then repeated. If needed, multiple PDSA cycles (PDSA ramps), each of which tests a different plan, can be run in parallel. For a new or significantly altered plan, prospective QI tools (e.g., failure modes and effects analysis) can be used before implementing the plan.\n\nThe precursor of the PDSA cycle is the PDCA model, which is still preferred in some settings and primarily focuses on testing currently running processes to ensure compliance and/or reliability. The letter \"C\" refers to the \"Check\" phase, in which the intervention is evaluated and expected results and actual results are compared to see whether the process is going as planned.",

Prenatal care for the current pregnancy was initiated late and she has missed several prenatal visits. She is not adherent to the micronutrient supplementation prescribed by the physician. She has a history of 3 medical abortions. Her medical history is remarkable for several visits to the emergency department over the past 5 years for nonspecific complaints. She is usually accompanied by her husband but has come in alone today. She appears anxious, has a tearful affect, and avoids eye contact. She denies any suicidal ideation. Physical examination shows multiple bruises of different ages on her forearms. When asked about the findings, the patient replies that she bruises easily. The remainder of the examination and the laboratory study results, including a complete blood count and coagulation studies, show no abnormalities. When asked if she feels safe in her relationship, the patient responds, “We have had our difficulties, like anyone, but my husband is a good man.” In addition to counseling and psychological support, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Late initiation of prenatal care, missed appointments, medication nonadherence, multiple abortions, injuries of different ages, and frequent visits to the emergency department should raise suspicion for intimate partner violence (IPV), which often becomes more severe during pregnancy and the postpartum period.",

        "letter": "D",
        "content": "Inquire about access to a shelter",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Individuals experiencing IPV are at high risk of health impairment (e.g., injury, preterm birth, death) and should be provided with information about in-house and community resources (e.g., shelters). Risk factors for escalation should be evaluated (e.g., partner being abusive during pregnancy, victim attempting to leave their partner) and a safety plan should be established with the patient before they leave the office. This plan typically includes advising the patient to prepare an emergency kit that contains important items (e.g., documents, money), which should be stored outside the home, defining a place to go to in case of an emergency (e.g., a shelter), setting up an alarm signal for contact persons (e.g., neighbors) to call emergency services, and advising the patient to avoid areas of increased risk at home in times of escalating violence (e.g., the kitchen, where knives are stored).\n\nScreening for IPV is recommended in all women of reproductive age. If the partner is present during the patient interview, it is important to first separate the patient from the partner before addressing suspected IPV as confrontation in front of the partner can endanger the patient. Requirements for reporting IPV vary by state. Reporting IPV to law enforcement is mandatory in most states if there is evidence of weapon injury or imminent danger. If there is no such evidence, patient consent is necessary before reporting the case to authorities. If children are involved, reporting to child protective services is often mandatory. If the patient is an at-risk adult, reporting to adult protective services may be required.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Patients with suspected IPV should generally not be encouraged to leave their partners. Many patients are not ready to leave their partners because of financial or family dependencies, feelings of guilt, or fear of retaliation. Pressuring the patient to leave their partner may weaken the patient-physician relationship. If a patient discloses abuse by a partner, a different action is more appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Reporting abuse to Adult Protective Services is mandatory in most states in cases of abuse of vulnerable adults (e.g., disabled individuals, elderly individuals). In cases of IPV affecting adults who are not considered vulnerable, reporting regulations vary between states. If there is evidence or threat of injury from a weapon, law enforcement must be notified in most states. This patient, however, shows no evidence of injury from a weapon. Furthermore, pregnant women have full decision-making capacity and patient consent is required to report cases like this one if there is no evidence of imminent danger. Another step is more appropriate at this time.",

However, because this patient has already missed several prenatal appointments and had several visits to the emergency department, IPV should be addressed immediately. To best protect the safety of the patient and her unborn child, a different action is more appropriate.",

A decrease in the number of preventable adverse events would not be the most likely effect of the implementation of an FFS system because such a model does not provide any incentives for decreasing error rates. On the contrary, hospitals with the FFS model tend not to implement services that improve quality of care if they do not directly generate income (e.g., training staff) and are reimbursed for each subsequent service made necessary by an error.",

        "explanation_why": "The FFS model provides reimbursements for each unbundled health care service provided, rewarding activity rather than efficient use of resources. This can lead to overutilization of health care services, as evidenced, for example, by an increase in the number of elective surgeries. Furthermore, the FFS model does not reward performance, good outcomes, and/or coordination of services. Together, these effects lead to healthcare fragmentation and increased health care expenditures. Nevertheless, the FFS model is the dominant payment model in the US. Advantages of this model include price transparency, large revenues, and a decrease in administrative overhead expenditure.\n\nAlternatives to the FFS model include the capitation model, the bundled payment model, and the pay-for-performance model. All of these models aim to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional FFS model (e.g., inefficient utilization of resources) but are not without their own disadvantages (e.g., increased overhead expenditure with the pay-for-performance model).",

    "question_text": "A 15-year-old girl with bronchial asthma is brought to the physician by her parents for a follow-up examination. She received a diagnosis of asthma 6 years ago. Her symptoms were well controlled with medications until 4 months ago, when she began to have frequent acute exacerbations, and she has required hospitalization 3 times during this period. Her current medications include daily inhaled budesonide-formoterol and a rescue albuterol inhaler as needed. Her parents say that she is doing well in school and is very social. Vital signs are within normal limits. Diffuse end-expiratory wheezes are heard on pulmonary auscultation. Spirometry shows an FEV_1:FVC ratio of 75% and an FEV_1 of 70% of predicted. Upon checking the patient's records, the physician notices that the patient's spirometry results have been worsening over time. Assessment with an inhaler adherence questionnaire discloses low levels of adherence to the prescribed regimen. The physician explores the reasons for low adherence levels, counsels the patient on the importance of inhaler therapy, and confirms understanding of medication use using the teach-back method. At this time, which of the following additional interventions would be most effective in improving the patient's adherence to therapy?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Increasing the awareness of asthma among this patient's close peers is likely to strengthen her adherence to therapy. With the onset of adolescence, relations with peers become a critical factor in treatment adherence in individuals with chronic illnesses (e.g., asthma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, epilepsy). The feeling of “not being normal,” a general desire for freedom and independence from adults, as well as fear of stigmatization due to disease increase the risk of nonadherence. Therefore, conveying social acceptance of the illness through peers (e.g., by teaching classmates about the illness, encouraging adolescents to take medication in front of peers, peer-to-peer online health communities) is an effective behavioral intervention to improve treatment adherence in adolescents.",

She has had several jobs over the past 10 years but is currently unemployed and has Medicaid insurance. There is no family history of serious illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The patient explains that she has seen several physicians in the past, but all of them refused to order the requested test for her. She says, “You seem wonderful, unlike my previous physicians. They were all incompetent. I even filed a lawsuit against one of them!” On exploring the patient's fear of cancer and the reasons for her inquiry, she reports that she saw an online direct-to-consumer advertisement about whole-body CT scans. The physician explains when whole-body CT scans are performed and why the test is not indicated in her case. The patient becomes agitated and insists that the physician order the test. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to the patient's request?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This response firmly yet politely rejects the patient's request. When evaluating a patient's demand for nonindicated care, physicians need to balance the core ethical principles. The ethical principle of patient autonomy, according to which a physician only assists in making decisions corresponding to the patient's personal values, is overruled in favor of beneficence and nonmaleficence in this directive counseling approach. Since there is no evidence that the possible benefits of whole-body CT scanning of asymptomatic individuals (e.g., to relieve the fear of cancer) outweigh the potential harm (e.g., radiation exposure, potential detection of ill-defined abnormalities requiring follow-up testing and interventions), the physician is acting in the patient's best interest (beneficence) and preventing harm (nonmaleficence). Moreover, denying nonindicated investigations and interventions also helps to ensure more equitable care. Finally, it is important for the physician to emphasize that the test is currently not indicated; it might be indicated in the future.\n\nThe patient's behavior in this scenario resembles splitting, a psychological defense mechanism characteristic of borderline personality disorder. Splitting involves separating experiences or people into all-good and all-bad, such as this patient's negative description of her past physicians. To minimize the effects of splitting, health care providers should collaborate toward common management goals, communicate regularly, and clarify their roles in patient care.",

        "explanation_why": "A suspected violation of medical licensing provisions should always be reported to an appropriate authority. A health care provider (HCP) who witnesses such a violation but fails to report it can be held liable for concealment. Suspected incidents of misconduct or incompetence can be reported initially to an oversight authority within the organization (e.g., department chair, chief medical officer, peer review body) if the HCP under suspicion is within the oversight authority's purview. The incident should be reported to the state medical licensing board (SMLB) if the HCP under suspicion is outside the oversight authority's purview (as in this scenario), the incident continues despite initial reporting, or, for any reason, the incident cannot be reported to an oversight authority. Complaints to the SMLB can be filed by anyone (e.g., patients, HCPs, other SMLBs), and, in some states, anonymously. Following a complaint to the SMLB, the licensee against whom the complaint is made receives a formal notification and is asked to make a statement and provide information to clarify the situation. If required, the SMLB can initiate formal hearings and/or initiate disciplinary actions (board orders).\n\nIn the case of billing fraud, the appropriate investigatory authority of the insurance provider (e.g., CMS office in cases of Medicaid or Medicare fraud) should also be informed. If the alleged misconduct potentially violates any criminal statutes, law enforcement authorities should also be informed. When a violation of a medical licensing provision is suspected to be due to physician impairment, it is appropriate to first inform the local Physician Health Program (PHP), which is supervised by the SMLB and can make recommendations to the SMLB if required.",

    "question_text": "A 69-year-old woman is hospitalized for the treatment of pneumonia by the end of the inpatient staff's morning shift after a routine admission procedure. She has hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include simvastatin and insulin. The physician covering the morning shift orders antibiotics and the patient's current medications, all of which are prepared in the hospital pharmacy as ready-to-use single doses in medication dispensers with barcode stickers.

    "content_preview": "A 69-year-old woman is hospitalized for the treatment of pneumonia by the end of the inpatient staff's morning shift after a routine admission procedure. She has hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include simvastatin and insulin. The physician covering the morning shift orders antibiotics and the patient's current medications, all of which are prepared in the hospital pharmacy as ready-to-use single doses in medication dispensers with barcode stickers.

        "explanation_why": "Asking the patient to state their full name and date of birth is a reliable method for verifying their identity prior to a medical intervention (e.g., drawing blood, administering medications or blood products). Further appropriate patient identifiers include an assigned identification number (on an armband attached to the patient), telephone number, or other unique identifiers available in the patient's health record or established on admission. The specific two patient identifiers used for verification should ideally be standardized within a given setting (e.g., consistently using full name and date of birth on this patient's ward).",

Moreover, when an armband is used as part of identification, it must be attached to the patient at all times.",

RCAs can be conducted following the near miss of a sentinel event (e.g., surgery on the wrong patient) and involve interviewing frontline workers (e.g., surgeons). Unlike the meeting described here, however, RCAs focus on identifying problems within systems and processes (blunt-end errors) rather than only individual actions (sharp-end errors) and involve discussions with interprofessional teams (i.e., all staff in the operating room including nurses, technicians, and anesthetists, not just surgeons). In addition, an RCA is a more thorough process than the one described in this scenario; it analyzes all events rather than select cases (if the RCA is conducted after multiple events) and is performed with the 5WH1 and 5 Whys technique and analysis tools (e.g., fishbone diagram) in order to determine the root cause of the problem.",

The first phase (“plan”) of the PDSA cycle consists of preparing a new process or tool (e.g., a patient safety training program for surgeons), identifying one or more quality improvement measures (QI measures) that reflect the performance of the new process or tool (e.g., an outcome measure such as the number of near miss events), and establishing a target for a change in the identified QI measure (e.g., a statistically significant decrease in the number of near misses).

The meetings should ideally follow a standardized format that includes analyzing medical errors and determining improvement measures to be followed up. M&Ms take place at regular intervals, typically monthly. The goal of an M&M is not to punish individuals but to identify measures for individual improvement and increase situational awareness as well as collective responsibility among team members. Since M&Ms are a type of peer review activity, the meeting's proceedings, findings, and recommendations (as well as any documentation) are legally protected and inadmissible in malpractice lawsuits.",

Prevention of C. difficile transmission does not require airborne precautions.\n\nLegionnaire disease (LD), which causes acute pneumonia and GI symptoms (e.g., watery diarrhea, abdominal pain), can spread in hospitals via airborne transmission as a result of aerosol generation from a contaminated water source (e.g., through an airconditioning unit or shower). However, patients with LD usually develop pneumonia and GI symptoms simultaneously, unlike this patient who developed GI symptoms 5 days after being admitted for pneumonia. Moreover, transmission-based precautions (e.g., airborne precautions) are not indicated when caring for patients with LD because person-to-person transmission of LD is extremely rare.",

        "explanation_why": "Adequate hand hygiene, which is a standard precaution, should always be performed by health care providers (HCPs) for infection control before and after contact with a patient, regardless of whether or not the patient has an infection. In most instances, the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) alone is a quicker and superior method of hand hygiene than washing hands with soap and water. However, hand hygiene with soap and water rather than an ABHR is required if the HCP's hands are visibly soiled or when caring for patients with acute infectious diarrhea or infections due to spore-forming organisms such as C. difficile, because ABHRs are ineffective against spores. Wearing gloves and a gown is an important adjunct in preventing contamination with spores but is not a substitute for hand hygiene. HCPs should wash hands with soap and water before putting on gloves and gowns as well as after removing them.\n\nWhen caring for patients with contact-transmitted diseases such as C. difficile infection, in addition to standard precautions, HCPs should follow contact precautions (e.g., isolating patients, wearing gloves and a gown upon room entry).",

Vaginal delivery was uncomplicated and mother and child were discharged after 3 days. Since the delivery of the child, the patient has had vaginal discharge that changed color from red to yellow. She has no pain with urination. She says that she has not been getting much sleep since her daughter's birth and often feels tired. She has not had depressed mood or excessive worrying. The child is exclusively breastfed. The patient has a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. She used to take metformin that was switched to insulin during pregnancy. She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. She lives with her husband, two children, and the newborn in a small town in Wyoming. Her only sexual partner is her husband. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m^2. Temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilaterally engorged, slightly tender breasts with erythematous nipples and a firm, nontender uterine fundus palpable at the height of the symphysis. There are yellowish stains on the perineal pad. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening all women of reproductive age for intimate partner violence (IPV). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the US, a little under 50% of women and men experience IPV during their lifetime. The risk of IPV increases during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Screening can help to address immediate threats and prevent long-term IPV-associated conditions (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder). To screen for IPV, the physician can ask a single nonjudgmental and nonstigmatizing question (e.g., “Some of the patients I see have been hurt or threatened by someone close to them. Is this something that you have experienced?”). IPV screening tools include the HARK questions, HITS screening tool, and STaT questions. Management of IPV includes immediate and, most importantly, ongoing support.\n\nThe USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for IPV in other patient groups (men, women not of reproductive age, vulnerable individuals, older adults) because of a lack of evidence that such interventions provide any benefit to these patients. Other sources do recommend screening for IPV in these patient groups because of an absence of harm and a potential benefit. The WHO recommends targeted screening for patients with red flags for IPV.",

Since this patient has no known risk factors for colorectal cancer (e.g., family history of colorectal cancer or hereditary cancer syndromes, personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease) and her last colonoscopy performed 4 years ago showed no abnormalities, she does not require colorectal cancer screening at this time.",

The direct visualization of Treponema pallidum in nasal discharge on darkfield microscopy confirms the diagnosis. Congenital syphilis is most common in children born to mothers who have not received prenatal care and/or were inadequately treated for syphilis before or during pregnancy. Further evaluation of affected infants includes CBC, CSF analysis, HIV testing, and other tests depending on the clinical presentation (e.g., long-bone x-ray for skeletal abnormalities, liver function tests for hepatomegaly). Treatment consists of a 10-day course of IV penicillin G.\n\nSyphilis screening is a mandatory part of the first prenatal visit in most US states.",

However, the varicella rash is widespread, usually severely pruritic, starts on the trunk, before spreading to the face, scalp, and extremities, and most patients present with rash in different stages of development (e.g., erythematous macules, vesicles filled with clear fluid, crusted papules). Neonatal HSV infection can manifest with skin lesions; however, the lesions are typically vesicular and associated with ocular (e.g., excessive tearing) and oropharyngeal (e.g., oral ulcerations) symptoms.

She institutes an antibiotic stewardship program to promote adherence to clinical practice guidelines. The program consists of personnel training, champions-led rounding, and regular health care provider assessment of antibiotic prescription practices. The team assigned to the program creates and communicates antibiotic stewardship roles and responsibilities and integrates interventions into daily clinical practice. The infectious disease chairperson examines the data of prescribed antibiotics 6 months after the implementation of the program.

        "explanation_why": "A run chart is a line graph that is used for tracking quality metrics over a specific period of time; these charts are used to improve the study phase of the plan-do-study-act cycle. On a run chart, the vertical axis represents the process that is being measured (e.g., monthly antibiotic prescriptions), the horizontal axis represents the timeframe of the observation, and the centerline represents the median value. The quality metrics are interpreted by applying probability-based rules (i.e., shift rule, trend rule, run rule, and astronomical point), which give information on whether the observed changes reflect a true improvement or are only random fluctuations.\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of an improvement, a control chart (Shewhart chart) is generated once enough data (15–20 data points) is available. On a control chart, a centerline represents the mean value, an upper line represents the upper control limit, and a lower line represents the lower control limit; all three lines are calculated based on the plotted data. These lines help to identify if the observed increasing or decreasing trends are stable variations (i.e., common cause variation) or indicators of an unpredictable change in the system (i.e., special cause variation).",

Pulmonary nodules with irregular borders (e.g., scalloped, spiculated) arise due to tumor growth along the pulmonary interstitium and carry a high risk of malignancy. Additional features that indicate a high risk of malignancy include upper lobe location and large nodule size (e.g., > 8–10 mm); older age (e.g. > 60 years), heavy nicotine use, and a history of prior cancer (see “Predictors of malignancy risk in patients with SPNs” table). In high-risk nodules > 8 mm (i.e., comprising only high-risk features) a surgical biopsy should be obtained and treatment should be initiated depending on the results. A PET-CT is indicated for patients with intermediate (i.e., both high and low-risk features) or low-risk nodules (i.e., comprising only low-risk features) > 8 mm. Nodules ≤ 8 mm can be followed up with serial CT scans. Surveillance frequency is determined by the patient's malignancy risk and nodule size.",

Bisphosphonates should be taken in the morning and evening at least 30 minutes before meals, with plenty of water, and the patient should maintain an upright position for at least 30 minutes following intake to prevent esophagitis. Other side effects are osteonecrosis of the jaw and hypocalcemia. Contraindications to bisphosphonates include hypocalcemia, esophageal abnormalities, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. In case of contraindications or unresponsiveness to bisphosphonates, medications such as parathyroid hormone analogs (teriparatide), selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene), or RANKL inhibitors (denosumab) may be used.\n\nSufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended as primary prevention and adjunct therapy for osteoporosis. Lifestyle modifications, such as physical activity (e.g., strength and balance training) and avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and glucocorticoids, should be encouraged.",

A high CV indicates that values are widely spread around the mean. In a system with multiple processes, such as the various aspects of a patient's visit, the process with the highest CV should be optimized first to improve the system's overall reliability and efficiency. Optimization of vital parameter measurements, which has the highest CV (5 ÷ 8 = 0.62), will therefore most likely have the greatest impact on reducing the average time that patients spend in the practice.\n\nIn contrast, SD, which is an absolute measure of dispersion, describes the variability of data in relation to the mean within a single data set.",

    "question_text": "A 58-year-old woman comes to an orthopedic surgeon after referral from her primary care physician because of a 10-year history of right knee osteoarthritis. She has not been able to walk her dog for the past 6 months because of severe pain that worsens with movement; during the past couple of weeks, she has also had pain without movement at night. Medical history is remarkable for several knee injuries from playing soccer in college. Previous treatment with physical therapy, diclofenac, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections has not provided significant pain relief. She has no other history of serious illness. She is 164 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 74 kg (163 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m^2. Range of motion of the right knee is limited; there is palpable crepitus and moderate swelling. X-ray of the right knee joint shows marked osteophyte formation and irregular joint space narrowing. The surgeon wants to schedule the patient for total knee arthroplasty. She has a health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance plan, and the surgeon is an in-network provider. The patient is concerned about potential out-of-pocket costs for this treatment. Which of the following is the most appropriate administrative action by the orthopedic surgeon?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 4,

        "content": "Defer knee surgery until a request for reimbursement is approved by the HMO",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Prior authorization (PA) is a process used by health insurance companies to evaluate the medical necessity and cost of medications, tests, and treatments in order to approve coverage before they are provided to the patient. Health insurance companies usually require PA for elective and expensive interventions that have lower-cost alternatives (e.g., arthroplasty). PA is obtained to ensure that the health insurance company will cover the requested care, protecting patients from financial liability. If a health care provider is in-network, they are responsible for determining whether an intervention needs PA and for submitting the request form to the health insurance company. Treatment should only be provided after the health insurance company has reviewed and approved the request.",
        "explanation_but": "Many health care providers have called for reforming of the PA process because of its detrimental impact on patient care. PAs are widely considered to be a time-consuming administrative burden that can result in delays in care and adverse clinical outcomes. Submitting requests electronically can help reduce administrative time and speed up the process of obtaining PA.",

        "explanation_why": "A pre-claim review requests provisional confirmation of coverage after treatment but before the submission of a final claim for payment. Because total knee arthroplasty is an expensive, elective procedure with lower-cost alternatives, coverage by the insurance company is not guaranteed. To avoid placing a financial burden on the patient, another action is preferred. In addition, the treating physician is responsible for submitting a pre-claim review.",

        "explanation_why": "All individuals with HIV should be screened for LTBI, regardless of the presence of additional risk factors for tuberculosis, as there is a high likelihood of progression to active tuberculosis. A positive screening test (i.e., interferon-γ release assay or TST) in an asymptomatic individual, combined with a normal chest x-ray, indicates LTBI. Depending on patient characteristics, an induration of ≥ 5 mm, ≥ 10 mm, or ≥ 15 mm can indicate a positive TST (see the “Positive TST according to induration diameter” table). In individuals with HIV, TST sensitivity may be reduced due to anergy, and therefore the induration cutoff is lowered to 5 mm to minimize false-negative results. For individuals with HIV, a long regimen (i.e., ≥ 6 months) of isoniazid and pyridoxine is the most appropriate treatment for LTBI.\n\nIndividuals with newly diagnosed HIV should also be screened for associated complications (e.g., AIDS-defining illnesses) and coinfections such as hepatitis B and C, STIs (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and, for women, trichomonas), and toxoplasmosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Children under 13 years of age are required by law to ride in the back seat on age- and weight-appropriate safety seats or boosters. From birth until at least 2 years of age and no later than when they outgrow the seat's height and weight limit (usually around 4 years of age), children should ride in a federally-approved rear-facing car seat. The use of age-appropriate restraints reduces the risk of injuries and death in motor vehicle collisions. Because front-seat airbags can injure or kill children during motor vehicle collisions, car seats should never be placed in the front seat.\n\nOther recommendations for parents of children at this age include education on oral development (e.g., teething usually begins between 6–10 months of age), nutrition, and household safety.",

However, pacifier use during sleep can lower the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Pacifier use may also be beneficial when breastfeeding is not possible (e.g., due to maternal illness) and to prevent a persistent finger-sucking habit. Therefore, limiting pacifier use to naptime and bedtime is recommended from 6 months of age, but it should not be routinely discouraged until approximately 2 years of age.",

This combination treats both withdrawal symptoms and acute cravings and is therefore more effective for smoking cessation than using only one form of NRT. Patients using NRT should be followed up closely to assess for efficacy and side effects. First-line pharmacological treatment alternatives to combined NRT include varenicline and bupropion, which also reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, behavioral interventions (e.g., counseling) should always be offered as part of first-line therapy to help individuals modify their smoking habits.",

Pregnancy and delivery of her first child 4 years ago were uncomplicated. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 10 years but refrained from smoking during her first pregnancy. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 13.1 g/dL and a serum β-hCG of 2,000 mIU/mL. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a gestational sac consistent with a 5-week pregnancy. When asked about her willingness to quit smoking, the patient replies that she is worried that she won't be able to quit because the frequency of her smoking has increased since the birth of her first child. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial intervention to support smoking cessation in this patient?",

Although pharmacotherapy (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion) is often used in combination with behavioral interventions in nonpregnant individuals, the safety and efficacy of these medications have not been established in pregnant individuals. Therefore, pharmacotherapy is used on an individual basis in pregnant patients who do not respond to behavioral interventions, when the clinician determines that its benefits outweigh its risks (e.g., in heavy tobacco use).",

        "explanation_why": "Very low calorie diets (200–800 kcal/day) or starvation diets (< 200 kcal/day) are generally not recommended in the management of obesity because they are associated with significant adverse effects (e.g., hair loss, increased gallstone risk) without any additional benefits when compared to low-calorie diets for long-term weight loss. Very low calorie diets and starvation diets can also decrease the basal metabolic rate by decreasing lean muscle mass and thereby make a patient resistant to weight loss and prone to rapid weight gain when such diets are stopped.",

        "explanation_why": "Behavioral interventions, such as exercise and diet modification, should be recommended for all patients with obesity. Therapy with a weight loss drug (e.g., liraglutide) is recommended for patients with a BMI ≥ 30 without obesity-related comorbidities or a BMI ≥ 27 with obesity-related comorbidities who do not achieve significant weight loss with behavioral interventions alone. Alternative weight loss drugs include semaglutide, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion. Orlistat is no longer routinely recommended for patients with obesity because its harms often exceed its benefits (e.g., frequent gastrointestinal side effects with minimal reduction in weight). The drug may be appropriate for patients who only require modest weight loss.\n\nBariatric surgery is typically reserved for patients with a BMI ≥ 35, patients with a BMI ≥ 30 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, or patients with a BMI of 30–34.9 who do not achieve significant weight loss with nonsurgical methods.",

The mother says, “Most teenagers her age are already engaging in sexual intercourse, so it's about time my daughter got protection. She has plans to go to college and cannot have a baby at this point.” The patient has no history of serious illness. She feels well but appears uncomfortable during the conversation. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The physician asks the mother to leave the room for the patient's privacy. After the physician initiates a conversation about contraception, the patient reveals that she wants to start engaging in sexual activity with her girlfriend. The patient has not been sexually active before. She says that she is afraid to tell her parents because they oppose same-sex relationships. Which of the following is the most appropriate next action by the physician?",

In addition to counseling on vaccinations, pregnancy, and safer sex practices (e.g., the use of barrier protection, such as dental dams), the physician should foster a trusting relationship in which the minor can openly communicate about sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identity and be informed about their options for receiving confidential care. Open communication between parents and their children about sexual health and relationships can have a positive impact on behavior (e.g., increased use of safer sex practices) and should be encouraged by physicians.

Three years ago, she was diagnosed with shingles and subsequently developed postherpetic neuralgia. She was treated with capsaicin cream, pregabalin, and lamotrigine. She says that none of the medications provided sufficient pain relief until she started taking hydrocodone 1 year ago. Additional medical history is remarkable for major depressive disorder, for which she takes sertraline. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 74/min, and blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urine immunoassay screening is negative for opioids but positive for benzodiazepines. Upon discussing the results with the patient, she claims that she has not taken any benzodiazepines. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Discontinuation of opioid therapy by cross-tapering to a nonopioid pain medication (e.g., naproxen) may be considered if the patient has a substance use disorder that would make concomitant opioid use dangerous or if opioid diversion is suspected. However, a negative result for opioids on UIA alone is insufficient evidence of drug diversion, and conclusions about a substance use disorder cannot be made from UIA alone.",

        "explanation_why": "Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids can lead to severe CNS and respiratory depression and should generally be avoided. UIA has several limitations, as false positive results for benzodiazepines can occur due to the intake of a drug with a similar structure, such as sertraline. Unexpected results should therefore be discussed with the patient and further investigated before making therapeutic decisions.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "UIA has a high incidence of false negatives as it may not reliably identify synthetic (e.g., fentanyl) and semisynthetic opioids (e.g., hydrocodone), and cross-reactivity with other medications and foods can cause false positive results (e.g., sertraline for benzodiazepines, poppy seeds for opioids). Therefore, unexpected results should be discussed with the patient to find possible explanations before drawing presumptive conclusions about treatment nonadherence, recreational substance use, or drug diversion and before making any therapeutic decisions. Results may also be discussed with laboratory personnel who can aid with interpretation. If no explanation is found, confirmatory testing with urine chromatography is necessary to reliably detect and quantify concentrations of specific drugs and their metabolites.",

The results indicate that it may be more economical to purchase multidose vials instead of individual prefilled syringes for injectable drugs. To reduce costs, the clinic pharmacy decides to transition from buying injectable operating room drugs in prefilled single-dose syringes to bulk packages of multidose vials that have to be prepared for single-use injection. An anesthesiologist raises the concern that multidose vials increase the risk of perioperative medication errors.

        "explanation_why": "Drugs that are commonly required during surgery should be prepared beforehand and should always be readily available. Involving the on-site pharmacist is a key step to prevent drug dispensing errors. If multiple patients receive doses from the same vial (as seen in multidose vials), drug dispensing for the operating room should take place in a clean area reserved for medication preparation (e.g., a satellite pharmacy) and in an aseptic manner (e.g., using sterile syringes, disinfecting the septum before piercing the vial). Preparing drug trays with prefilled syringes in conjunction with clear labeling (e.g., with the drug's generic name and drug concentration) using standardized printed labels maximizes patient safety by reducing the risk of product mix-ups and dispensing errors. The label may also include the date, time, pharmacist's name, and the patient's name and date of birth.",

Therefore, there would be an increased risk of attentional capture and skill-based errors if the circulating nurse prepared the drugs; a different person should be designated for drug dispensing. In addition, drugs that are commonly required during surgery should be prepared prior to surgery and always readily available.",

Therefore, there would be an increased risk of attentional capture and skill-based errors if the anesthesiologist was responsible for drawing up drugs during surgery. Moreover, the anesthesiologist works in the immediate patient area, and dispensing drugs in this area is not recommended, as it increases the risk of contamination.",

His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 128/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar on the right abdomen. Results of laboratory studies, including carcinoembryonic antigen levels, are within the reference ranges. The patient reports that he generally feels fine and asks if the blood tests he undergoes during monthly visits to his primary care physician (PCP) are necessary. While reviewing the patient's electronic health record (EHR), the physician notices that the PCP has been ordering monthly complete blood counts and serum ferritin tests since the cancer diagnosis.

However, the PCP is often the coordinator of a patient's care, and there may be an indication for the monthly blood workups that the oncologist is unaware of. Therefore, the oncologist should approach the PCP privately and inquire in a nonjudgmental manner about the reason for the monthly tests. Timely and effective communication between healthcare providers improves the quality of care, increases patient satisfaction, and reduces the incidence of medical errors. Moreover, it can help reduce unnecessary or repetitive therapeutic and diagnostic interventions, which can cause discomfort for patients, increase the risk of false positive results, and waste healthcare resources. If providers disagree because of differing processes, priorities, or levels of knowledge and training, a conflict resolution approach, such as collaboration (conflict management strategy), should be used to reach a consensus.",

Despite access to care, patients with public insurance often have worse healthcare outcomes than those with private insurance. Health disparities based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender identity, sexual orientation, and language are common and can account for these differences in outcomes. In many cases, the cause of the disparities involves social determinants of health that are beyond the control of individual patients and providers. In the case of hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions that respond to diet and exercise, health disparities between groups are frequently due to a lack of access to healthy foods and/or safe environments for exercising. Low-income individuals often live in food deserts where healthy foods are not as available or as affordable as unhealthy convenience store food or fast food. Low-income populations are also more likely to be targeted by the fast food and tobacco industries, which encourage unhealthy habits.",

An RR < 1.0 indicates that a given treatment decreases the probability of an outcome. The CI provides a range of plausible values for the true RR based on the available data. A CI that does not include 1.0 indicates a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Finally, the width of the CI provides information about the precision of the estimate. If the RR estimate is 0.78 and the CI is 0.71–0.86, the intervention likely has a protective effect, and the magnitude of that effect (relative risk reduction) could be anywhere from 14–29%. The narrower the CI, the more precise the RR estimate. Therefore, approach A has the set of results that shows a protective effect (i.e., an RR <1.0 with a CI that does not include 1.0) with the most precision (i.e., the narrowest CI).",

Random allocation to the treatment groups (which leads to balancing of potential confounders between the groups) and blinding allow the investigators to attribute any observed differences in the primary outcome between treatment groups to the intervention and not to other causes. Thus, the advantage of the study identified is that it allows the researchers to determine whether prophylactic antibiotics are beneficial in preventing urinary tract infections and scarring.\n\nPatients that sign up for RCTs tend to differ from people in the broader population, making generalizability of the results to the larger population difficult.

This 25-year-old patient was born after universal childhood hepatitis B immunization became standard practice; therefore, she likely received the full hepatitis B vaccine series in early childhood and does not require catch-up vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccine boosters are indicated only in high-risk patients (e.g., occupational exposure, immunocompromise, those receiving hemodialysis) who are nonimmune according to HBV serology (HBsAb < 10 IU/mL).",

After initial Tdap vaccination, all patients should receive tetanus-diphtheria vaccine or Tdap boosters every 10 years. This patient’s last tetanus-containing vaccine was at 12 years of age, so she is overdue for a Tdap booster. As a middle school teacher, protection against pertussis is especially important to prevent transmission to vulnerable children. Tdap also maintains immunity against diphtheria, which can cause severe illness.\n\nAnnual influenza vaccination is also recommended for all adults, including this patient, but Tdap is the most urgent vaccination in this scenario.",

The USPSTF advises beginning at age 21 with Pap smear alone every 3 years until age 29, and for individuals aged 30–65 years, either primary HPV testing every 5 years, HPV/Pap cotesting every 5 years, or Pap smear alone every 3 years. In contrast, recent guidelines from the ACS, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend starting primary HPV testing every 5 years at age 25, with HPV/Pap cotesting every 5 years as an alternative, and Pap smear alone every 3 years if HPV testing is unavailable. As this patient is 23 years of age, asymptomatic, and up-to-date with other preventive screenings, she should undergo cervical cancer screening with a Pap smear.",

        "explanation_why": "Formerly, the management approach for abnormal cervical cancer screening was determined by test results alone. Recent recommendations have shifted to a risk-based approach. Risk calculators can be used to estimate the immediate risk of CIN3. If this risk is ≥ 4%, colposcopy and cervical biopsy or expedited treatment may be used. If this risk is < 4%, surveillance with HPV-based testing every 1–5 years is recommended.\n\nHowever, certain patient groups (e.g., women < 25 years of age) should still be treated based on test results. In patients < 25 years of age with HSIL on cytology, colposcopy and biopsy are indicated. Expedited treatment (without a preceding colposcopic biopsy and histological confirmation) is not recommended at this age as most cervical abnormalities regress spontaneously. Low-grade lesions (LSIL or ASC-US) in patients < 25 years of age can be managed with cytology-alone screening annually for the next two years.",

This patient has a 3-week history of cough with no evidence of red flags for cough (e.g., hemoptysis, fever, chest pain, respiratory distress). The physician should acknowledge the patient’s worry about cancer, briefly confirm that no urgent features are present, and then advise a timely follow-up visit on the next business day. They should also give clear instructions for seeking urgent care if symptoms worsen. This approach is empathetic, avoids premature reassurance, and preserves trust while maintaining appropriate clinical boundaries and ensuring proper evaluation and appropriate documentation in a fully staffed setting.\n\nIn order to ensure the efficient use of health care resources and avoid overcrowding, only patients with urgent conditions should be referred to the emergency department.",
