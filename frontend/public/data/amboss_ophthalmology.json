He has had worsening left shoulder and arm pain for 3 months. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows left-sided ptosis. The pupils are unequal but reactive to light; when measured in dim light, the left pupil is 3 mm and the right pupil is 5 mm. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ophthalmologic symptoms?",

However, cavernous sinus thrombosis has additional symptoms that are not present in this case, such as headache, photophobia, proptosis, and other cranial nerve palsies (commonly CN VI). In addition, cavernous sinus thrombosis is most commonly caused by an ascending infection from the face or sinuses, signs of which are not present here. This patient's arm and shoulder pain would likewise not be explained by cavernous sinus thrombosis.",

Rather than mydriasis, this patient has miosis. Furthermore, if such an aneurysm were symptomatic, it would manifest with headache rather than the shoulder and arm pain seen here.",

Paralysis of the inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles results in downward deviation (hypotropia) and outward deviation (exotropia) of the affected eye (down-and-out gaze) due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle results in ptosis and impairment of parasympathetic function in mydriasis (as well as loss of accommodation and pupillary light reflex, which are not shown).

However, this patient does not have nystagmus and the diplopia in INO is only present when the patient's gaze moves towards the contralateral side of the lesion, in contrast to this patient's resting diplopia.

Compressive lesions are characterized by pupillary involvement due to injury to the outer parasympathetic layer of CN III (which controls pupil dilation, light reactivity, and accommodation). Additional injury to the deeper somatic fibers of the nerve (which control extraocular muscles) is responsible for this patient's ptosis and “down and out” gaze. Acute CN III palsy due to a cerebral aneurysm is very concerning for imminent rupture.

Paralysis of the inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles results in downward deviation (hypotropia) and outward deviation (exotropia) of the affected eye (down-and-out gaze) due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle results in ptosis and impairment of parasympathetic function in mydriasis (as well as loss of accommodation and pupillary light reflex, which are not shown). Patients present with horizontal or horizontal and vertical double vision (diplopia) that worsens when turning the gaze away from the affected side. The ptosis, however, may prevent patients from experiencing diplopia.",

Although she has always been short for her age, her classmates have begun teasing her for her height. She is at the 5^th percentile for height and 25^th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a low-set posterior hairline, increased skin folds along the side of the neck, and a high-arched palate. The nipples are widely spaced and the fourth metacarpal bones are shortened bilaterally. This patient is at increased risk of developing which of the following complications?",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with Turner syndrome are at increased risk of cardiovascular anomalies, most commonly bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta. Early in life, a bicuspid valve is often asymptomatic or only becomes symptomatic with exertion. At this time, the condition typically manifests with a systolic click heard best at the left lower sternal border or apex. Bicuspid aortic valve predisposes to early-onset valvular calcifications, which can lead to premature aortic stenosis and/or insufficiency as early as the fourth decade of life. In contrast, senile calcific aortic stenosis peaks in patients > 80 years.\n\nPatients with bicuspid aortic valve are also at increased risk of infectious endocarditis.",

The white spots are granular perivascular white opacities around retinal vessels that resemble cotton-wool spots. In the early stages of the disease, vision may still be unaffected even though funduscopic findings are already present. If left untreated, CMV retinitis progresses rapidly and patients develop painless vision loss or scotomas depending on the location of the retinal lesions and whether there is retinal detachment.\n\nSee “Ophthalmologic complications of HIV” table.",

HSV-1 conjunctivitis is more common in children and adults, while HSV-2 often affects neonates. HSV conjunctivitis is usually unilateral and often manifests with a vesicular rash and corneal involvement (e.g., dendritic keratitis). Additionally, patients with a history of atopic dermatitis are particularly susceptible to HSV conjunctivitis.\n\nHSV conjunctivitis is usually self-limited and resolves within 2 weeks, although neonatal forms can be fatal. The gold standard for diagnosis of HSV conjunctivitis is cell culture. However, typical cases in neonates or immunosuppressed patients should be treated without laboratory confirmation, as testing may delay treatment. In adults, treatment is only indicated in corneal involvement. Therapy usually consists of topical, oral, and/or IV acyclovir, depending on the severity of the disease, the age of the patient, and underlying conditions (e.g., immunosuppression).",

Over the past 2 weeks, she has had nasal congestion and a constant, mild headache. She did not visit a doctor and instead took over-the-counter naproxen and phenylephrine. Her nasal congestion has since improved, but the headache persists. She underwent a dental procedure for caries about 10 days ago. She does not recollect any recent insect bites or trauma. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears ill and reports occasional chills. Her temperature is 38.3°C (101°F), pulse is 89/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows proptosis of the right eye. Vision is impaired in the affected eye. Her right upper and lower eyelids are erythematous, swollen, and tender to touch. Ocular movements cause severe pain. Her headache is worsened by leaning forward and improves when the patient is lying on her back.

This leads to ophthalmoplegia and loss of sensation in the upper two-thirds of the face. Since this patient does not have any cranial nerve symptoms, cavernous sinus thrombosis is unlikely.",

Visual acuity can remain normal until severe stages of the disease. For early detection of chloroquine retinopathy, all patients given high doses of chloroquine should undergo regular ophthalmic examinations. In this patient, treatment with chloroquine should be discontinued to prevent further eye damage.\n\nOther common side effects of chloroquine include sensorineural deafness, anorexia, photosensitivity, alopecia, tinnitus, leukopenia, and worsening of conditions like epilepsy, psoriasis, and porphyrias.",

These benefits are generally considered to outweigh the increased risk of developing infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) associated with the medication, which is more common in newborns < 2 weeks old. Infants should still be closely monitored for any signs of IHPS, such as nonbilious vomiting and irritability when feeding. See “Overview of neonatal conjunctivitis” table.\n\nThe CDC recommends chlamydia screening for all pregnant women < 25 years of age (and those over 25 years of age if at increased risk) and retesting during the third trimester because neither oral nor topical antibiotic therapy is effective for the prevention of CC.",

She was born via vaginal delivery at 39 weeks' gestation to a 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1. The mother had an unmedicated delivery at home; the patient did not receive any routine postpartum medications. The mother had not seen her gynecologist since her first prenatal visit. The newborn's temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 42/min, and blood pressure is 73/53 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination shows eyelid edema, conjunctival injection, and copious yellow mucopurulent discharge from the right eye. There is no corneal ulceration or evidence of keratitis. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?",

If left untreated, NGC may result in corneal scarring and blindness. After confirming NGC (using culture and Gram stain or PCR), systemic treatment with either an IV or IM third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) is indicated.

Although this patient presents with conjunctivitis, his conjunctivitis is bilateral and is associated with itching and watery discharge.

He has hypercholesterolemia, stable angina pectoris, hypertension, and a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include glyburide, atorvastatin, labetalol, isosorbide, lisinopril, and aspirin. He feels well. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 154/78 mm Hg. The extremities are well perfused with strong peripheral pulses. Ophthalmologic examination shows visual acuity of 20/30 in the left eye and 20/40 in the right eye. Visual fields are normal. Fundoscopic examination shows two grayish-white spots along the supratemporal and inferotemporal arcade. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Cardiopulmonary examination shows systolic rumbling at the right carotid artery. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia. In addition to obtaining a CT scan of the head, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The most common cause in older adults is atherosclerotic emboli, which is consistent with this patient's age, extensive atherosclerotic risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, stable angina pectoris, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus), history of possible transient ischemic attack, and finding of an ipsilateral carotid bruit on examination.",

Cardiogenic emboli are the most common cause of retinal artery occlusion in younger patients (< 40 years of age) and should be suspected based on a patient history that includes, e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF), endocarditis, or valvular disease. However, while this patient does have a history and exam findings that both suggest retinal vessel occlusion and a TIA, he has no AF and there are signs of carotid artery stenosis. Echocardiography would be an appropriate step in management only after atherosclerotic causes of this patient's symptoms have been ruled out.",

Suspicion of GCA should be especially high in patients above the age of 50 with fundoscopy findings of pallid optic disc swelling without apparent emboli. While our patient's monocular vision loss and history of intermittent monocular blurriness could be consistent with GCA, he lacks additional symptoms such as temporal headache or jaw claudication, and his fundus examination reveals clearly demarcated areas of vascular involvement, which is not consistent with GCA.

    "question_text": "A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of decreased vision and black spots in front of his left eye for the past 24 hours. He states that it feels as if 'a curtain is hanging over his eye.' He sees flashes of light intermittently. He has no pain or diplopia. He underwent cataract surgery on the left eye 2 weeks ago.

However, in contrast to retinal detachment, degenerative retinoschisis is typically asymptomatic, has a very good prognosis, and rarely requires intervention, which is not consistent with this patient's acute and dramatic visual impairment, making this diagnosis less likely.",

        "explanation_why": "Retinal detachment is vision-threatening and considered an ophthalmological emergency. Retinal detachment is associated with a number of risk factors, including previous intraocular surgery (e.g., cataract surgery). Patients may experience a prodrome of flashes of light (photopsia) and moving dark spots or “floaters” prior to detachment, which correlate to retinal traction and vitreous hemorrhage respectively. Patients classically describe a “rising wall” or “dark curtain” across their field of vision as the retina partially separates from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Although the patient is awaiting fundus examination, which would conclusively diagnose retinal detachment, his symptoms and the absence of an anterior chamber pathology are consistent with the classic presentation of retinal detachment.\n\nMost cases of retinal detachment require prompt surgical treatment (e.g., vitrectomy followed by internal tamponade and laser photocoagulation/cryoretinopexy).",

Although this condition would also manifest with a unilateral headache and chemosis, the headache is usually frontal rather than temporal. Acute angle-closure glaucoma primarily affects older individuals and would also cause symptoms such as eye pain and blurred vision. Additionally, acute angle-closure glaucoma does not manifest with periorbital edema, lateral gaze restriction, bilateral ptosis, or fever.",

In preseptal cellulitis, the infection is typically restricted anteriorly by the orbital septum and characterized by unilateral ocular pain with edema and erythema of the eyelid. As most cases of preseptal cellulitis stem from a contiguous skin infection, the orbit is not involved. This patient's ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, and high fever are not characteristic of preseptal cellulitis and are more concerning for a disseminated infection involving the orbit and paranasal sinuses, for which the combination of oral clindamycin and amoxicillin would not be appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Surgical debridement, along with amphotericin B, is the treatment of choice for mucormycosis, which can manifest with headache, nasal discharge, fever, erythema of the skin overlying the orbit, and cranial nerve palsies, which are seen here. However, this condition is seen almost exclusively in patients who are immunocompromised or diabetic, particularly those with diabetic ketoacidosis, which this patient does not have. Most commonly, such patients develop a rhino-orbital-cerebral infection, which is characterized by the formation of a black eschar on the palate or nasal mucosa due to extensive local tissue necrosis. In septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, endonasal surgery (e.g., sphenoidectomy, ethmoidectomy, mastoidectomy) is only indicated if first-line treatment options are unsuccessful.",

        "explanation_why": "Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. Empiric therapy with vancomycin (for coverage of MRSA) should be combined with a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefepime) and, if the infection originated from the sinus or the teeth, metronidazole (for anaerobic coverage). Affected patients should be treated with high-dose, prolonged antibiotic therapy to reach bacteria sequestered within thrombi. Antifungal therapy (amphotericin B) is indicated in confirmed cases of fungal origin.",

Either condition can manifest with a severe unilateral headache. However, typical features of a cluster headache include short recurring pain attacks (lasting only minutes) and ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (e.g., lacrimation, nonpurulent nasal discharge, facial sweating), which this patient lacks. As for migraines, patients commonly have nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, which are also not present here. Neither condition is associated with periorbital edema, chemosis, or fever.",

Anosmia is typically associated with meningiomas arising from the olfactory groove (i.e., from the cribriform plate and frontosphenoidal suture), which account for 22% of all skull base meningiomas. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is a brain MRI, which is likely to show a round, sharply demarcated space-occupying lesion (resembling a snowball) with significant contrast enhancement. Management is based on the location and grade of the tumor, as well as patient-specific factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, accompanying symptoms). Treatment that reduces elevated intracranial pressure may improve visual function.",

Optic neuritis can manifest with acute vision change and a relative afferent pupillary defect.

Also, MS typically manifests with relapsing, remitting neurologic symptoms in anatomically unrelated locations (i.e., symptoms disseminated in time and space), whereas this patient's symptoms are chronic and progressive. Less commonly, MS can cause chronic, progressive symptoms, but it does not cause elevated intracranial pressure, thus it would not explain this patient's headaches.",

Over the past 2 weeks, he has become increasingly irritable and within the past day has taken more daytime naps and appears much less responsive and interactive. His mother denies any history of fever or trauma at home. He has not received any vaccinations as his parents believe he is already healthy and does not need them. He spends most of the day with a babysitter while both parents are at work. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Auscultation of the heart and lungs shows no abnormalities. The anterior fontanelle is tense and bulging. Fundoscopic examination shows bilateral retinal hemorrhage. A complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 10,000/mm^3. An x-ray of the chest shows healing fractures of the 2^nd and 3^rd right ribs. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

However, increased intracranial pressure would more likely be associated with papilledema on fundoscopic examination than retinal hemorrhages.

Children who are septic from meningitis may also rarely present with retinal hemorrhages. However, bacterial meningitis typically presents more acutely, in a matter of hours or days. Additionally, this child is afebrile and has a normal white blood cell count, both of which are unexpected findings in children with meningitis, particularly in meningitis due to bacterial pathogens.",

Long-term deficits resulting from SBS include sight, hearing, and speech impairment. SBS has an extremely high mortality rate, with approx. 25% of affected children dying as a result of sustained injuries. Cranial CT scan in patients with SBS often shows additional brain injuries such as chronic subdural hematoma (which would explain this patient's subacute presentation over 2 weeks), subarachnoid bleeding, and/or diffuse punctate parenchymal hemorrhages.",

While anterior uveitis usually presents with eye pain, redness, and photophobia, it would not present with corneal edema or a fixed dilated pupil (unless the patient has had multiple previous bouts of uveitis causing iris scarring). These features suggest angle-closure glaucoma, in which mydriasis (i.e., relaxation of the iris) worsens the blockage of the trabecular meshwork and further reduces the drainage of aqueous humor from the eye. Therefore, the administration of atropine or other mydriatic drugs, as well as covering the eye (darkness induces mydriasis), can worsen the condition and must be avoided.",

Her friend's elbow struck her head, just above her left ear. She did not lose consciousness, but her mother reports that she was confused for 20 minutes after the incident and did not recall being hit. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows the head tilted toward the right shoulder. A photograph of the eyes at primary gaze is shown. The finding in the patient's left eye worsens when she is asked to look to the right side or tilt her head toward her left shoulder. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the left temporal bone. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes when tested independently. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength and sensation are intact bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Plantar reflex shows a flexor response. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient has unilateral hypertropia in the primary gaze (i.e., while looking straight ahead), which can be due to ipsilateral weakness of eye depressors or contralateral weakness of eye elevators. Worsening of this patient's hypertropia in the right lateral gaze (on left eye adduction) and when the patient tilts her head to the left shoulder (on left eye intorsion) suggests ophthalmoplegia of the left superior oblique muscle (SOM).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The trochlear nerve innervates only the superior oblique muscle (SOM), which is a depressor and intortor of the eyeball. Trochlear nerve damage, therefore, causes hypertropia and vertical diplopia, as seen here. Hypertropia due to left SOM palsy worsens during right lateral gaze because the SOM is the only muscle that can depress an adducted eye. Hypertropia due to SOM palsy also worsens when the head is tilted toward the ipsilateral shoulder because the superior rectus muscle (an elevator) takes over the role of the paralyzed SOM as the primary intortor, resulting in elevation of the eye. To decrease vertical diplopia, patients with SOM ophthalmoplegia tilt their head away from the affected side (compensatory head tilt), like this patient who tilts her head to the right. The trochlear nerve is the cranial nerve that is most commonly damaged in cases of trauma, because its long course and thin diameter make it vulnerable to shearing injury.",

The intraconal space is located posterior to the globe and contained within the cone formed by the recti muscles. The mass is well-defined and displaces rather than invades surrounding structures. The left optic nerve is not visualized on this image, and the mass either arises from it or displaces it. The normal-appearing right optic nerve (red overlay) is well visualized.The differential diagnosis for intraconal masses depends on whether or not the lesion is continuous with the optic nerve. Differential diagnoses for masses involving the optic nerve include, but are not limited to, meningioma, glioma, and lymphoma. Differential diagnoses for masses not involving the nerve include, but are not limited to, hemangioma, schwannoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.",

The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

Spinal drop metastases are found in about 40% of cases.\n\nEpendymomas are often located in the posterior fossa and may also manifest with signs of hydrocephalus, as well as ataxia and cranial nerve dysfunction.

During this period, she was unable to distinguish colors with her right eye. She also reports pain with eye movement. She has no double vision. She occasionally has headaches that are relieved with ibuprofen. One year ago, she had a similar episode that affected her left eye and resolved spontaneously. She has no history of serious illness. She works at a library and enjoys reading, even in poor lighting conditions. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows that the right and left pupils do not constrict when a light is shone into the right eye. When light is shone into the left eye, both pupils constrict. Without correction, visual acuity is 20/50 in the left eye, and 20/100 in the right eye. With spectacles, the visual acuity is 20/20 in the left eye and 20/100 in the right eye. Slit-lamp examination shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Once neuroimaging has been performed to exclude other sources of intracranial hypertension, lumbar puncture (with opening pressure) is indicated for the diagnosis of IIH (according to the modified Dandy criteria). Because in IIH the intracranial pressure is uniformly elevated in the ventricular system and the subarachnoid space, there is no risk of cerebral herniation and, therefore, a lumbar puncture may safely be performed. An opening pressure > 20–25 cm H_2O confirms intracranial hypertension, and normal CSF studies rule out other common causes of intracranial hypertension (e.g., meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage). Once the diagnosis is confirmed, discontinuation of potential causes (e.g., vitamin A supplements), a low-sodium weight loss program, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) would be recommended.",

The retinal veins are dilated and tortuous (examples marked by white lines). There are multiple peripapillary hemorrhages, which appear as flame-shaped hemorrhages (examples marked by blue overlay). Cotton wool spots are also present and appear as bright spots (examples marked by arrowheads).These features are characteristic of papilledema.

She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 98 kg (216 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes with mild peripheral vision loss. Fundoscopic examination shows bilateral optic disc swelling. An MRI of the brain shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed; opening pressure is 310 mm H_2O. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 4/mm^3 (75% lymphocytes), a protein concentration of 35 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 45 mg/dL.

Patients with newly-diagnosed IIH should discontinue any offending agents (e.g., vitamin A analogs, tetracyclines), adopt a low-sodium weight loss diet (if overweight), and begin acetazolamide. Although the mechanism is not clear, CAIs are believed to reduce the rate of CSF production, thereby decreasing intracranial hypertension.",

        "explanation_why": "Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an ophthalmologic emergency that is precipitated by sudden obstruction of the trabecular meshwork outflow tract. Mydriasis narrows the space between the iris and the lens and can cause this obstruction. When this patient entered the dark theater her pupils dilated, which likely caused the acute obstruction. This patient shows the most common signs and symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma including ocular pain, blurry vision, headache, vomiting, and a nonreactive pupil in the affected eye. First-line treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma is pressure-lowering eye drops (e.g., timolol or pilocarpine), often in combination with systemic treatment (e.g., acetazolamide), followed by laser peripheral iridotomy.",

Over time, optic nerve atrophy results in large, cupped optic discs (a cup-to-disc ratio > 0.6), optic disc pallor, and decreased visual acuity.

    "hint": "This patient presents with a unilateral red, hard, severely painful eye with a mid-dilated, nonreactive pupil as well as frontal headaches, vomiting, and nausea. These features are consistent with acute closed-angle glaucoma. The condition is particularly common in Asian individuals and can be precipitated by stress.",

For this reason, it is often given as a component of first-line therapy for acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nThis agent should only be administered once intraocular pressure (IOP) is < 40 mm Hg, and it is contraindicated in cases of lens-induced glaucoma (e.g., in lens luxation), which is not seen in this patient.",

        "explanation_why": "Epinephrine is an α- and β-adrenergic receptor agonist (β > α) that causes pupillary dilator muscle contraction (via α1-receptors), leading to mydriasis, and ciliary muscle relaxation (via β2-receptors), which in turn results in a reduction in trabecular meshwork pore size. Together, these effects impede the natural outflow of aqueous humor and lead to increased intraocular pressure. In a patient with signs and symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma, increasing the intraocular pressure can quickly lead to permanent loss of vision; for this reason, epinephrine is contraindicated in this patient.",

The spaces in the trabecular tissue are called spaces of Fontana, which connect the anterior chamber and Schlemm's canal, which is located in the sclera.

        "explanation_why": "Ptosis occurs in patients with CN III palsy because the levator palpebrae superioris muscle is innervated by the oculomotor nerve. Whereas patients with CN III palsy due to compression usually show dilated pupils, those with diabetic mononeuropathy normally do not have pupillary involvement because the microangiopathy typically involves the vasa nervorum within the oculomotor nerve, while the pial blood vessels (which supply the superficial parasympathetic fibers) are usually spared.\n\nCN III palsy due to diabetic or hypertensive microangiopathy usually improves with blood pressure and glycemic control. Patients should be monitored closely (every 2 days) during the first week. If the diplopia, ptosis, and/or external ophthalmoplegia worsen during this period or persist after 3 months, an MRI should be performed.",

            "description": "Oculomotor nerve palsy (here, of the left eye) causes ipsilateral impairment of both motor and autonomic (parasympathetic) nerve functions. Paralysis of the inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles results in downward deviation (hypotropia) and outward deviation (exotropia) of the affected eye (down-and-out gaze) due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle results in ptosis and impairment of parasympathetic function in mydriasis (as well as loss of accommodation and pupillary light reflex, which are not shown). Patients present with horizontal or horizontal and vertical double vision (diplopia) that worsens when turning the gaze away from the affected side. The ptosis, however, may prevent patients from experiencing diplopia.",

However, there is no clinical or radiological evidence of elevated intracranial pressure and/or hemiparesis to suggest tentorial herniation, or a history of trauma to suggest a skull base fracture; aneurysms only account for approx. 5% of cases of isolated CN III palsy.",

Additional features include light, pale hair and blue eyes (due to decreased melanin production). Since most patients are asymptomatic until severe and often irreversible complications have occurred, direct measurement of phenylalanine levels is an important part of newborn screening for metabolic disorders. The screening test is performed on the second day after birth using blood obtained from a heel prick.",

However, elevated intracranial pressure usually manifests with rapidly increasing circumference of the head in neonates, which is not seen in this infant. Furthermore, instead of the roving eye movements, a downward deviation of the eyes (sunset eye sign) would be expected in patients with hydrocephalus.",

        "explanation_why": "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication in preterm infants and usually occurs within the first five days after birth. This complication is typically seen in neonates of < 1500 g birth weight and born before 32 weeks' gestation due to the fragility of the germinal matrix. Additional risk factors include peripartal chorioamnionitis and hypoxia (as suggested by this patient's low Apgar scores). Most infants with IVH are asymptomatic, but saltatory (over several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible. Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, bulging anterior fontanelle, and neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures, cranial nerve abnormalities as suggested by poor pupillary light reflexes and roving eye movements), all of which this patient has.\n\nCranial ultrasonography is the preferred method to diagnose IVH in newborns. Since most patients are asymptomatic, screening ultrasounds are routinely performed in infants with a birth weight < 1500 g and delivery before 30 weeks' gestation.",

Vascular malformations within the eye lead to increased intraocular pressure and early-onset glaucoma. Patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome require anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis and regular ophthalmological screening.

She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and horizontal nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and horizontal nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Convergence testing shows no abnormalities. Fundoscopy shows bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye and abduction nystagmus of the contralateral eye (i.e., dissociated nystagmus) on lateral horizontal gaze should raise concern for internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), in which convergence is usually preserved. This patient's findings are consistent with bilateral INO. In addition, painful eye movements and hyperemia of the optic discs suggest optic neuritis.",

        "explanation_why": "Caudal displacement of the cerebellar vermis occurs in patients with Chiari II malformation, a condition that usually causes hydrocephalus secondary to stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius and may cause cerebellar signs (e.g., ataxia). While this patient has signs of balance problems, Chiari II malformation is almost always seen in conjunction with a lumbosacral or thoracic meningomyelocele, so it is often detected at birth. Based on her history alone, this adult patient is very unlikely to have this diagnosis. Moreover, Chiari II malformation does not cause INO.",

In MS, demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) can lead to INO. In younger patients, MS is the most common cause of INO. In older patients (especially those with arteriosclerotic risk factors), INO is more commonly caused by ischemic infarction and manifests with unilateral findings and additional stroke findings. All patients with INO should undergo MRI of the brain.",

Furthermore, this patient's episode of balance difficulties is consistent with a brainstem tumor. However, it would be rare for these tumors to cause INO in isolation, as they usually also cause additional cranial nerve abnormalities (e.g., dysarthria, dysphagia, facial sensory loss) and other neurological changes (ataxia and upper motor neuron lesions). Finally, brainstem gliomas are much more common in individuals under the age of 20 years.",

Her symptoms initially started in the left eye and progressed to involve both eyes within 24 hours. She presents with profuse tearing and reports that her eyes are sticky and difficult to open in the morning. She was diagnosed with asthma 2 years ago and has been admitted to the hospital for acute exacerbations three times since then. Current medications include inhaled beclomethasone, inhaled albuterol, and montelukast. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F). Physical examination reveals a tender left preauricular lymph node. There is chemosis and diffuse erythema of the bulbar conjunctiva bilaterally with watery discharge. Slit-lamp examination shows a follicular reaction in both palpebral conjunctivae and diffuse, fine epithelial keratitis of both corneas. Corneal sensation is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The mother reports that the boy has had five nosebleeds within the past 2 weeks, each lasting between 15 and 20 minutes. The patient was born at term and has been hospitalized twice for pneumonia treatment. There is no family history of serious illness. The patient is at the 8th percentile for height and the 30th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a small, thin child with two flat, dark brown areas of hyperpigmentation across the upper back and a similar discoloration on the left buttock. There is bilateral esotropia. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.3 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 107 μm^3, leukocyte count of 3800/mm^3, and platelet count of 46,000/mm^3.

        "explanation_why": "Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a heterogeneous group of mutations, all of which lead to deficits in DNA repair mechanisms and, thus, a high frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Fanconi anemia has a wide variety of clinical manifestations. One of the most common and notable features is a predisposition for developing acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in early adulthood. Pancytopenia is also common and manifests with mucocutaneous bleeding, recurrent infections, and anemia (normocytic or macrocytic). Other skin, skeletal, and organ anomalies include short stature, hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation of the skin, cafe-au-lait spots, microcephaly and developmental delay, ocular abnormalities (e.g., esotropia and hypertelorism), and thumb and forearm malformations.\n\nFanconi anemia should not be confused with Fanconi syndrome, a proximal renal tubular defect resulting in type 2 renal tubular acidosis (Type II RTA) and defective reabsorption of, e.g., potassium, glucose, phosphate, and amino acids.",

        "explanation_why": "All children who present with leukocoria should undergo a prompt funduscopic examination to rule out retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is the most common and, if left untreated, most lethal primary intraocular malignancy in children. The condition typically manifests with leukocoria, strabismus, and a white mass in the retina on fundoscopy. Less commonly, there is visual impairment and/or redness of the eye due to inflammation. Ocular ultrasound and MRI are indicated to evaluate the size and extent of the tumor. Treatment is primarily surgical, with specific surgical techniques (e.g., cryotherapy vs. enucleation) dictated by imaging results. Chemotherapy is used as an adjuvant if there is metastatic disease.\n\nRetinoblastoma is caused by sporadic or inherited mutations in the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) and may be associated with other malignancies (e.g., osteosarcoma, pinealoma). This patient's sister has a history of osteosarcoma, which suggests an inherited mutation. Molecular genetic testing is recommended in all patients with retinoblastoma to identify germline mutations, as family members may also be at risk.",

A mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene causes MFS. Fibrillin-1 is needed to form microfibrils that provide strength to connective tissue and store growth factors. A mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene thus leads to defective connective tissue (causing hypermobility and lens dislocation) and excessive growth factor release (causing tall stature).\n\nWhile there is no cure for MFS, preliminary data suggest that ARBs (e.g., losartan) may have a protective or even reversing effect in some of the clinical manifestations of MFS. Other treatment options focus on preventing specific symptoms (e.g., aortic dilatation treated with beta blockers, and scoliosis treated with bracing, physical therapy, and analgesia).",

Type IV collagen is found in the glomerular basement membrane, the cochlea, and the lens of the eye. Thus, a defect of type IV collagen may result in hematuria and nephritic syndrome, sensorineural hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus leading to vision problems (patients with Alport syndrome “can't pee, can't see, can't hear a bee”).\n\nThe diagnosis of Alport syndrome is confirmed via skin biopsy (showing the absence of type IV collagen alpha-5 chains in the basement membrane) or, if skin biopsy is inconclusive, kidney biopsy. Patients with proteinuria, such as this boy, should receive ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers to slow the progression to end-stage renal disease.",

However, ARPKD does not account for sensorineural deafness and lenticonus. Instead, patients with ARPKD who survive to adolescence usually have evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, splenomegaly).\n\nIn about 15% of cases, Alport syndrome may be the result of an autosomal-recessive mutation.

MEN 2 syndromes are also associated with pheochromocytoma, which may arise in the posterior mediastinum. However, pheochromocytoma causes hypersecretion of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and/or dopamine, which leads to episodes of sweating, tachycardia, hypertension, and headaches, typically starting between the age of 20–40 years. This constellation of symptoms is not present in this 2-year-old boy, making pheochromocytoma and an associated MEN 2 syndrome very unlikely.",

General symptoms of neuroblastoma include failure to thrive, weight loss, nausea, and fever, while more specific symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. In approx. 20% of cases, the tumor arises from the thoracic ganglia, and mass effects in the posterior mediastinum can lead to dyspnea, cough, and airway obstruction that predisposes to respiratory infections. At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients with neuroblastoma already have features of metastasis to the eye orbit (e.g., proptosis, “raccoon eyes”), bones (e.g., pain), and/or the skin (subcutaneous nodules).\n\nOverexpression of N-myc oncogene is associated with a poor prognosis.",

Furthermore, lymphomas are rare in children < 5 years of age. This patient's posterior mediastinal mass and periorbital ecchymoses indicate a different diagnosis.",

While symptoms are similar in both conditions, radiographic presentation differs.\nRadiographic imaging in primary TB commonly shows a Ghon complex (Ghon focus with its associated lymph node), unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and homogenous consolidation with ill-defined borders in the middle and lower lobes. Chest x-ray in reactivation TB typically shows multiple cavities in the upper lobes, calcifications, patchy consolidations, and features fibroproliferative disease (e.g, scarring) due to inflammatory tissue destruction.",

However, hypoglycemia usually manifests within minutes or hours rather than days. Moreover, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia usually occurs when the patient is on insulin therapy and has a relative overdose of insulin (e.g., in times of decreased food intake) or is taking certain medications such as insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides) or nonselective beta-blockers.

This patient's UTI began 4 days ago, which makes this diagnosis unlikely. Infectious uveitis is also unlikely since this condition would generally cause unilateral manifestations and would not explain the patient's other symptoms (e.g., fatigue, dehydration).",

        "explanation_why": "In a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who presents with a UTI, blurred vision and signs of dehydration should raise suspicion of a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Patients with T2DM have a reduced insulin secretion capacity, which can lead to severe hyperglycemia in times of stress (infections, surgery, trauma) due to increased insulin demand. Hyperglycemia in turn leads to progressive volume depletion via osmotic diuresis. Patients present with polyuria, polydipsia, signs of volume depletion (dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor), hypotension, and even circulatory collapse. Hyperglycemia with subsequent osmotic diuresis also affects visual acuity, most probably due to swelling of the lens.\n\nSerum glucose > 600 mg/dL would support the diagnosis of HHS. Treatment consists of aggressive IV electrolyte and fluid replacement as well as insulin for hyperglycemia, which should be given under vigilant monitoring of serum glucose and potassium.",

The episode of binge drinking is usually followed by nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The ensuing hypoglycemia and increased lipolysis promote the production of ketone bodies. Clinical and laboratory signs of alcohol-associated hepatitis and signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome would be expected. Although patients with diabetes are particularly at risk of developing ketoacidosis if they consume alcohol without sufficient caloric intake from foods, it is more likely in type 1 DM.

Furthermore, DKA typically occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, which results in absolute insulin insufficiency. In the case of type 2 diabetes mellitus, DKA usually occurs in the advanced stages when the patient is completely insulin-dependent and beta-cell function has declined so much that endogenous insulin production is negligible.",

Tonometry shows an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 20 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable. Fundoscopic examination shows subretinal fluid and small hemorrhages with grayish-green discoloration in the macular area in the right eye, and multiple drusen in the left eye with retinal pigment epithelial changes. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's condition?",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "hint": "This patient's acute, painless, unilateral loss of vision, together with his history of gradual loss of central vision and fundoscopic findings of subretinal hemorrhages and grayish-green retinal discoloration, are characteristic of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Advanced age and smoking are risk factors for this condition.",

Second-line treatment options for wet AMD include photodynamic therapy and laser photocoagulation. Smoking cessation, hypertension control, and antioxidant vitamin supplementation are recommended for both dry and wet AMD.",

For the past week, she has had nasal congestion, recurrent headaches, and a watery nasal discharge that became purulent 4 days ago. She started antibiotics for these symptoms but did not complete the course. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She appears to be in severe distress. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination of the right eye shows proptosis and diffuse edema, erythema, and tenderness of the eyelids. Right eye movements are restricted and painful in all directions. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There is tenderness to palpation over the right cheek and purulent nasal discharge in the right nasal cavity. The left eye shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,000/mm^3. Which of the following provides the strongest indication for administering intravenous antibiotics to this patient?",

While fever, leukocytosis, and eyelid changes (e.g., edema, erythema, tenderness) can occur with both preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis, painful ocular movements, ophthalmoplegia, reduced vision, and proptosis are specific for orbital cellulitis, a sight-threatening infection of the orbital contents. While preseptal cellulitis can be treated with oral antibiotics, the spread of infection to the orbital tissues requires prompt treatment with empiric IV antibiotics (vancomycin plus one of the following: ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam).\n\nSee “Orbital cellulitis vs. preseptal cellulitis” table.",

She admits that she takes her medication inconsistently. She wears contact lenses. Current medications include abacavir, lamivudine, efavirenz, and a nutritional supplement. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 89/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival injection of the left eye. Visual acuity is 20/20 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. Extraocular movements are normal. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 90/mm^3. A photograph of the left eye after fluorescein administration is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Given that this patient has a herpes infection, she is at risk of developing NK. However, NK manifests with decreased visual acuity, chronic dry eye, and the absence of eye pain. On slit lamp examination, spots on the corneal epithelium (early stage) or a circular/oval non-healing corneal ulcer (late stage) are visible. This patient presents with an acute 3-day history of eye pain, watery discharge, and a dendritic ulcer on examination, making NK an unlikely diagnosis.",

An accumulation of white-yellow exudate (hypopyon; blue overlay) consisting of inflammatory cells and/or bacteria/fungi within the anterior chamber can be seen completely covering the inferior aspect of the iris.These findings are consistent with infective keratitis, associated here with contact lens use.",

Dendritic corneal ulcers that stain with fluorescein are characteristic of this condition. HSV is widespread and primary ocular infection can follow inoculation via direct contact. However, most ocular infections are caused by viral reactivation and replication, which can occur in immunocompromised individuals like this patient with AIDS. Topical antiviral therapy with trifluridine or ganciclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV keratitis.\n\nSee “Keratitis overview” table.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa easily adheres to contact lenses and is the most common cause of bacterial keratitis among contact lens users. Risk factors include wearing contact lenses for an extended period of time and poor contact lens hygiene. Pseudomonas keratitis typically manifests with a rapid progression of symptoms, such as a decline in vision, eye pain and difficulties opening the affected eye, redness, photophobia, and foreign body sensation. If left untreated, pseudomonas keratitis can lead to corneal perforation within 2–5 days. Therefore, urgent treatment with topical broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin with tobramycin or gentamicin) should be initiated.

However, DCR should be deferred until the active infection has subsided. Because this patient has features of active infection (erythema, warmth, purulent discharge from the lower punctum), DCR is not indicated at this time.",

Oral antibiotics with gram-positive coverage, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, would be the first-line empirical therapy in a patient with mild to moderate acute dacryocystitis. As this patient has no features of severe infection, i.e., fever or features of orbital cellulitis (restricted, painful eye movement or diplopia), oral antibiotics are an appropriate treatment option.

Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid is a rare malignancy, which usually manifests as a hard nodule on the eyelid that resembles a recurrent or persistent chalazion. Basal cell carcinoma (most common eyelid tumor) often manifests as a papule with rolled-up pearly borders while squamous cell carcinoma (second most common eyelid tumor) manifests as a small nonhealing ulcer with rolled-up borders. Untreated, these tumors can metastasize and/or invade surrounding structures, including the intracranial cavity. Hence, timely diagnosis with a biopsy of the lesion for histopathological examination is recommended in all recurrent chalazia or those that do not respond to treatment.",

    "hint": "The patient's blurring of central vision and Amsler grid findings indicate central metamorphopsia. The fundoscopy showing multiple yellow areas at the macula confirms the diagnosis. Since these spots do not obscure the retinal vessels, the pathology must be below the nerve fiber layer (i.e., either a hard exudate or a druse but not a cotton wool spot). The clustering of spots around the macula, the absence of sharp margins, and the absence of other retinal pathology indicate that these spots are soft drusen rather than hard exudates.",

Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular complaints?",

    "hint": "This patient presents with features of hyperthyroidism (amenorrhea, hot flashes, diaphoresis, weight loss, tachycardia, hypertension), ophthalmopathy (bilateral exophthalmos, inability to converge the eyes, ocular pain), and a goiter, the combination of which suggests Graves disease.",

        "explanation_why": "Accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the orbital tissues is one of the main causes of Graves ophthalmopathy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors are expressed in the thyroid gland as well as the intraorbital adipocytes and fibroblasts. TSH receptor antibodies in patients with Graves disease bind to the orbital TSH receptors and stimulate orbital fibroblasts to secrete GAG and adipocytes to proliferate. GAGs are hyperosmolar, drawing intracellular/intravascular fluid out into the interstitial space and causing edema of the orbital contents. GAG accumulation, edema, and increased adipocytes increase the orbital pressure and push the globe forwards, causing exophthalmos, compression of the extraocular muscles, ophthalmoplegia (inability to converge eyes, diplopia, difficulty reading), and ocular pain.",

However, CLL is associated with further features, such as lymphocytosis, a history of recurrent infections (e.g., necrotic erysipelas, candidiasis, and/or herpes zoster), and polyclonal gammopathy (i.e., broad-based peak representing a polyclonal increase in immunoglobulins) rather than monoclonal gammopathy (i.e., single spike of monoclonal IgM immunoglobulin).",

In addition, the CRAB symptoms (hypercalcemia, renal disease, anemia, and bone lesions) are classically present to varying degrees.

        "explanation_why": "Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is an indolent type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is caused by abnormal production of IgM antibodies by monoclonal plasma cells. This condition usually manifests in older patients with impaired platelet function (nosebleeds), anemia, and mild thrombocytopenia, progressive neuropathy (history of pain and numbness in the feet, muscle weakness), and hyperviscosity syndrome (vision and hearing loss). Lymph node enlargement, as well as increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase can also be present. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrating a dense, monoclonal IgM band is essential for diagnosis. Treatment includes administration of CD20 antibodies (e.g., rituximab) and plasmapheresis in case of hyperviscosity syndrome.\n\nHyperviscosity syndrome is present in about 30% of patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. This condition is not caused by an increase in hematocrit but rather from the clumping effects induced by the pathologically elevated serum IgM concentrations (i.e., IgM act as cold agglutinins).",

He had forgotten to remove his contact lenses before going to sleep. After removing the contact lenses, he experienced immediate pain, discomfort, and watering of the left eye. He reports that the foreign body sensation persists and that rinsing with water has not improved the pain. He has been wearing contact lenses for 4 years and occasionally forgets to remove them at night. He has no history of serious medical illness. On examination, the patient appears distressed with pain and photophobia in the left eye. Administration of a topical anesthetic relieves the pain. Visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes. Ocular motility and pupillary response are normal. Corneal reflex is normal and symmetric in both eyes. Which of the following is most likely to establish the diagnosis in this patient?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "Eye pain, excessive tearing, photophobia, and foreign body sensation that appear acutely after the removal of an overworn contact lens are suggestive of a corneal abrasion. Although visual acuity is preserved in corneal abrasion, this patient has a previous history of wearing contact lenses and decreased visual acuity in both eyes, suggesting a refractive error.",

        "explanation_why": "Fluorescein examination is the test of choice for identifying a corneal abrasion. Corneal abrasions are defects in the corneal epithelium that often occur secondary to corneal trauma. Removal of contact lenses after wearing them overnight is likely to have caused a corneal abrasion in this patient. Fluorescein dye specifically stains the epithelial defects, making them easily identifiable on slit lamp, ophthalmoscopic, or Wood lamp examination. In addition, the conjunctival surface of the eyelids should be examined to rule out a foreign body such as a retained contact lens. In corneal abrasion, photophobia can be attributed to spastic miosis resulting from the trigeminal sensation of the cornea.",

While patients with an intraocular foreign body or an open globe injury typically present with pain, decreased visual acuity of the affected eye, not both eyes, is also expected. Patients with an open globe injury usually have additional findings of an irregular pupil and a relative afferent pupillary defect. In addition, this patient has no history to suggest blunt or penetrating ocular trauma.",

Both of these conditions can occur in contact lens wearers secondary to inadequate contact lens hygiene. Bacterial conjunctivitis and keratitis manifest with tearing and foreign body sensation. However, severe purulent discharge and conjunctival injection are also seen in bacterial conjunctivitis. In keratitis, the visual acuity of the affected eye is decreased and, if severe, corneal edema and hypopyon would be present.",

        "explanation_why": "In up to 40% of patients with Graves disease, radioactive iodine ablation (RAIA) will cause the onset or exacerbation of Graves ophthalmopathy. The exact underlying mechanism is not understood, but it has been hypothesized to involve the release of thyroid autoantigens with epitopes similar to those of retro-orbital connective tissue antigens, and a TSH surge due to therapy-induced hypothyroidism. The TSH surge possibly induces the production of thyrocyte autoantigens and the proliferation of retro-orbital connective tissue (because retro-orbital preadipocytes in patients with Graves disease can express TSH receptors). An exacerbation of Graves ophthalmopathy can be prevented with glucocorticoid therapy for 6–12 weeks after radioiodine therapy.\n\nMost patients with Graves disease become hypothyroid after RAIA and require life-long thyroid hormone replacement.",

High doses of I^131 such as those used to treat well-differentiated thyroid cancer can also rarely cause agranulocytosis as a result of bone marrow suppression. However, the dose of I^131 used for radioiodine therapy in Graves disease is not large enough to cause bone marrow suppression.",

The median time between the diagnosis of GCA and thoracic aortic aneurysm is about 10 years. Some medical centers use serial chest x-rays or CT/MR angiography to screen for aortic aneurysms. However, routine screening for large vessel involvement is not generally recommended in patients with GCA because there is limited evidence that it positively affects patient outcomes.\n\nFurther complications of GCA include permanent vision loss (if left untreated) and cerebral ischemia (predominantly in the area of the posterior cerebral artery).",

You likely picked this option because branches of the internal carotid artery (e.g., the posterior ciliary arterial branches of the ophthalmic artery) are affected in amaurosis fugax and vision loss in GCA. However, symptoms in GCA are caused by inflammation of these smaller arteries, not stenosis of the large internal carotid artery, which is a rare complication of this condition. In addition, GCA is more commonly associated with the occlusion of branches of the external carotid artery (e.g., the temporal artery, resulting in headache).",

During the accident, the boy's right eye was exposed to potassium hydroxide. He has severe pain in his right eye and reports difficulty keeping the eye open. The boy states he was wearing his prescription glasses when the accident occurred and that, immediately after the accident, his eye was irrigated thoroughly with cold tap water for approximately 5 minutes by the teacher. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/78 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination of the right eye shows erythema and blistering of the skin over the eyelid, with conjunctival congestion and excessive tearing in the eye. There is a partial thickness laceration above the right eyebrow. Further examination is impeded due to marked blepharospasm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "B",

    "hint": "This patient's clinical features (ocular pain, conjunctival congestion, excessive tearing, marked blepharospasm), which appeared after exposure to a caustic chemical, indicate a chemical ocular burn.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Immediate and thorough irrigation with sterile normal saline (e.g, via a plastic scleral lens) following an ocular chemical burn is the most important step to prevent permanent vision loss. Immediate irrigation initiated by first responders should continue for at least 30–60 minutes or until the pH of the eye has normalized. This process can sometimes take 2–3 hours for alkaline compounds such as potassium hydroxide because they are lipophilic and thus penetrate tissue more quickly. This patient has ongoing symptoms after just 5 minutes of irrigation. Continued irrigation in the emergency department should therefore begin immediately. Once irrigation is completed and the pH has normalized, broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be administered.",

However, steroids might have a negative impact on reepithelialization and increase the risk of secondary infection. Thus, they should be used with caution and for a limited amount of time only.

Although this patient's eyebrow laceration suggests possible blunt force trauma, addressing the chemical burn to the eye should be the first step in management. Furthermore, crossed bandaging after a chemical ocular burn could increase the risk of a symblepharon, thus leading to further complications.",

However, attempting to neutralize exposure to alkaline agents by irrigation with acidic solutions, and vice versa, is not recommended because the neutralization reaction releases heat, which can cause further damage to the eye.",

He says that the left eye feels “swollen,” but it does not hurt and he can still see everything clearly. He spent the last couple of days at his cousin's house in the countryside but had to return home today as his cousin developed an upper respiratory tract infection. The patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Family history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis in his mother. Immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge and chemosis. There is also bilateral eyelid edema and a 2-mm long abrasion on his left upper eyelid. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Fundoscopic examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Examination findings include diffuse conjunctival injection, chemosis, and eyelid edema. Additionally, eversion of the eyelid may show conjunctival papillae. Management of AC includes allergen avoidance, cold compresses, artificial tears, and topical pharmacotherapy (e.g., antihistamines). Systemic pharmacotherapy can be considered if nonocular symptoms are present.\n\nSee “Overview of conjunctivitis subtypes in children and adults” table.",

Neurofibromatosis type 1 has a typical onset in adolescence and manifests with multiple neurofibromas, benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that originate from neural crest cells. Neurofibromatosis type 2 has a later onset in early adulthood and manifests with multiple cerebral and spinal tumors.",

PDR develops because chronic hyperglycemia results in the death of retinal microvascular cells and capillary dysfunction, with subsequent ischemia. Dying cells release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the growth of new fragile blood vessels (neovascularization) that hemorrhage easily and interfere with the transmission of light. Neovascularization can also cause retinal detachment and scarring. Laser photocoagulation helps reduce the progression of neovascularization and decreases the risk of vision loss. Strict glycemic and blood pressure control should be maintained in patients with PDR. Therapy with VEGF inhibitors may also be recommended, particularly in patients with significant macular edema.",

Higher arterial oxygen tension in a premature infant inhibits the production of VEGF, leading to apoptosis of endothelial cells and cessation of normal retinal vascular formation. Switching to room air results in relative hypoxia due to the lower oxygen concentration, increased metabolic demand of the growing retina, and poor vascular network, leading to the production of proangiogenic growth factors (e.g., VEGF) and uncontrolled neovascularization. The formation of new blood vessels can cause hemorrhages, form fibrovascular membranes, and ultimately lead to retinal detachment or blindness.",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "A headache, temporal tenderness, double vision, fatigue, and an increased ESR in this woman over 50 years of age are highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA). Concurrent myalgia possibly indicates polymyalgia rheumatica, which is commonly associated with GCA. Focal granulomatous inflammation of the temporal artery layers with fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina confirms the diagnosis of GCA in this patient.",

The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia).",

An X-linked defect in type IV collagen is responsible for most cases of Alport's syndrome, which results in progressive sensorineural hearing loss (with high-frequency sounds affected first) and hematuria. Episodes of gross hematuria are sometimes preceded by upper respiratory tract infections. Patients with Alport's syndrome also commonly develop an anterior lenticonus since type IV collagen is the predominant collagen fiber in the lens capsule. A family history of renal disease among males is common in patients with Alport's syndrome.",

Optic chiasm: The two optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, where the nasal fibers of each retina cross over to the contralateral side. The temporal fibers remain uncrossed.\n4. Optic tracts: Each optic tract carries contralateral nasal fibers and ipsilateral temporal fibers (i.e., the right optic tract carries the nasal fibers of the left eye and the temporal fibers of the right eye). I.e., each optic tract carries the contralateral visual field of each eye.\n5. Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN): The optic tracts synapse onto the ipsilateral LGN.\n6. Optic radiation: consists of neurons that carry visual information from the ipsilateral LGN to the ipsilateral primary visual cortex\n7. Primary visual cortex: The visual pathway terminates at the primary visual cortex, which is located at the posterior aspect of the occipital lobe. It is responsible for the perception of sight.

    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "The patient's findings of enophthalmos (posteriorly displaced eye) and infraorbital rim tenderness are suggestive of an orbital floor fracture (orbital blowout fracture). The mechanism of this injury can lead to downward displacement of orbital fat and inferior rectus muscle entrapment, which in turn can cause impaired upward gaze.",

Pneumatization of the frontal sinuses may also occur as a result of orbital trauma in cases of orbital roof fractures. These fractures are rare in adults because of the strength of the orbital roof.

Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) can lead to bruising and immunosuppression, the latter of which is consistent with this patient's 3-month history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. However, immunosuppression is not specific to scurvy and this patient does not have other dermatological manifestations of scurvy such as perifollicular hemorrhages, petechiae, and corkscrew hairs. Her history of frequent stumbling at night and triangular keratin plaques on the conjunctiva suggest a different deficiency.",

Because vitamin A is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and retinal pigmentation, retinol deficiency results in dermatological and ophthalmological manifestations, such as xerosis cutis and Bitot spots. A deficiency in vitamin A can also cause immunosuppression, which explains this patient's recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Moreover, this patient's recent history of stumbling in the dark most likely results from night blindness (nyctalopia), another common manifestation of vitamin A deficiency.",

Moreover, her frequent stumbling at night and triangular keratin plaques on the conjunctiva suggest a different deficiency.",

She has had an upper respiratory tract infection for the past 2 days and has been taking phenylephrine to control her symptoms. Examination shows a rock-hard, injected left globe and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil on the left. Gonioscopy shows that the iris meets the cornea at an angle of 10° (N = 20–45°). Systemic pharmacotherapy is initiated with a drug that decreases the secretion of aqueous humor from the ciliary epithelium. The next day, her serum potassium concentration is slightly decreased.

This patient, however, has acute closed-angle glaucoma and is being treated with a systemic medication. In addition, latanoprost increases aqueous humor drainage through the uveoscleral pathway, whereas this patient was treated with a medication that decreases the secretion of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.

While beta-blockers also improve the symptoms of glaucoma by decreasing aqueous humor synthesis, they are associated with hyperkalemia, in contrast to this patient who developed hypokalemia after starting the medication.

It is a first-line treatment for acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, which can be precipitated by mydriasis due to darkness, fear, stress, or certain medications (e.g., phenylephrine). However, acetazolamide can impair bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, which may cause non-anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of type 2 renal tubular acidosis.

Increased susceptibility to glare is a finding of normal aging, most likely due to the effects of intraocular light scatter.

While most patients are asymptomatic at birth, half of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have seizures with cerebral foci, a lag of psychomotor development and a musty body odor by 4–6 months of age. Additional features include light, pale hair and blue eyes (due to decreased melanin production). Since most patients are asymptomatic until severe and often irreversible complications have occurred, direct measurement of phenylalanine levels is an important part of newborn screening for metabolic disorders. The screening test is performed on the second day after birth using blood obtained from a heel prick.",

        "explanation_why": "Germinal matrix hemorrhage is the underlying cause of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in preterm infants. IVH is a common complication in preterm infants that usually occurs within the first five days after birth. It is typically seen in neonates weighing < 1500 g and born before 32 weeks' gestation due to the fragility of the germinal matrix. Additional risk factors include peripartal chorioamnionitis and hypoxia (as suggested by this patient's low Apgar scores). Most infants with IVH are asymptomatic, but saltatory (over several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible. Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, seizures, bulging anterior fontanelle, cranial nerve abnormalities (e.g., pupil reacting sluggishly to light), and changes in eye movement (e.g., roving eye movements), all of which this patient has.\n\nCranial ultrasonography is the preferred method to diagnose IVH in the newborn. Since most patients are asymptomatic, screening ultrasounds are routinely performed in infants with a birth weight < 1500 g and delivery before 30 weeks' gestation.",

        "explanation_why": "The patient was most likely treated for atrioventricular block (AV block), which can manifest with shortness of breath and dizziness. Atropine (a muscarinic antagonist) is used to increase the heart rate in AV block due to its ability to reduce the effects of the parasympathetic nervous system on the SA node and the AV node. In the eye, atropine causes pupillary dilatation, which can result in narrowing of the anterior chamber angle and obstructed flow of aqueous humor between the posterior and anterior chamber, potentially leading to acute angle-closure glaucoma.",

            "description": "Cross-section of the anterior portion of the eyePressure rises in the posterior chamber if the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior to the anterior chamber is obstructed due to a functional block (pupillary block) between the lens and the pupillary portion of the iris. This increase in pressure causes the peripheral portion of the iris to move anteriorly and to cover parts or all of the chamber angle (particularly in mydriasis or mid-dilation), potentially leading to acute angle-closure with massively increased intraocular pressure. In certain anatomical variants (e.g., shallow anterior chamber), the chamber angle is already narrow and therefore increases the probability of acute and/or chronic angle-closure, which can lead to damage of the optic nerve (glaucoma).",

        "explanation_why": "Pleuritis is an inflammation of the pleura that lines the lungs and is commonly caused by viral infection. It usually presents with a sharp chest pain that worsens with inhalation, but shortness of breath and dizziness are rare. Viral pleuritis is usually managed with analgesic drugs, e.g. NSAIDs, which do not precipitate angle-closure glaucoma.",

        "explanation_why": "Epinephrine is an alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. Epinephrine is used topically to treat open-angle glaucoma because alpha-1 receptor stimulation induces vasoconstriction and subsequently decreases aqueous humor production. Alpha-1 receptor agonism also causes pupillary dilation (mydriasis), which decreases the iridocorneal angle and subsequently decreases aqueous humor outflow. In individuals with angle-closure glaucoma, mydriasis can rapidly increase intraocular pressure and lead to permanent loss of vision. Therefore, epinephrine is contraindicated in this patient. Mydriatic eyedrops (e.g., atropine, homatropine, and tropicamide), which are often used for ophthalmologic examination, should also be avoided in patients suspected to have angle-closure glaucoma for the same reason.",

The spaces in the trabecular tissue are called spaces of Fontana, which connect the anterior chamber and Schlemm's canal, which is located in the sclera. The aqueous humor drains via Schlemm's canal into the episcleral veins.",

Pilocarpine is contraindicated in patients with asthma or COPD, and in cases of angle-closure glaucoma secondary to iritis or lens luxation because miosis can worsen eye pain or glaucoma. The history of similar symptoms in the past suggests primary rather than secondary angle-closure glaucoma.",

Affected individuals may also develop pharyngitis and conjunctivitis, which would be consistent with this patient's presentation.

Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are more prone to developing the disease and carrier testing is therefore commonly performed in pregnant patients of this group or patients who wish to conceive. There is no cure and treatment is largely supportive. Usually, patients die of respiratory infections before 5 years of age.\n\nNiemann-Pick disease may manifest without hepatosplenomegaly, which can make it very difficult to differentiate Niemann-Pick disease from Tay-Sachs disease without diagnostic histological evidence (i.e., of foam cells in Niemann-Pick disease and lysosomes with an onion skin appearance in Tay-Sachs disease).

        "explanation_why": "Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a condition of impaired blood drainage from the brain due to thrombosis of cerebral veins or the dural sinus, which can lead to tissue ischemia. CVT can cause manifestations of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, altered mental status, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits) as seen in this case. Risk factors for the development of CVT include hypercoagulability (e.g., due to oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and the puerperium), malignancy, and infection. In particular, local infections of the sinuses, mouth, face, neck, and/or ears (like this patient's recent episode of acute otitis media) can precipitate CVT. An increased serum concentration of D-dimer, which is a fibrin degradation product produced during clot breakdown, supports a diagnosis of CVT. Urgent imaging studies are required to confirm the diagnosis.",

However, opacification would not be restricted to the pupillary area, as seen here. Instead, it would be present in the inferior region of the anterior chamber and obscure the underlying iris. Moreover, the chronic nature of the patient's symptoms and the absence of pain and conjunctival injection make a different kind of ocular damage more likely.",

It blocks ß_2 receptors in the ciliary body of the eye, decreasing aqueous humor production and consequently lowering intraocular pressure. However, because timolol is passively absorbed into the systemic circulation from the eye, it has high bioavailability, potentially leading to systemic side effects such as the blockade of ß_1 receptors in the heart and subsequent negative ionotropic and chronotropic effects. In excess, these effects can cause bradyarrhythmias and orthostatic hypotension, both of which can lead to syncope, as seen in this patient.\n\nNonselective beta blockers also cause bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with reactive airway disease, and should be used with caution in patients with asthma.",

Additionally, at the temporal superior arcade an embolus is present (arrow-head).This is the classical finding of acute central retinal artery occlusion.Purple circle: Optic disc",

On fundoscopic examination, the neurosensory retina is detached from the retinal pigment epithelium on the temporal side, resulting in a corrugated, opaque appearance compared to the intact medial side. The most frequent causes of RD are tears or holes in the retina (rhegmatogenous RD); less commonly, RD can occur without a retinal tear (nonrhegmatogenous RD). Risk factors include high myopia, trauma (in this case, likely caused by jumping on a trampoline), previous intraocular surgery, and posterior vitreous detachment.\n\nThe prognosis in RD is good if surgery is performed at an early stage and if there is no macular involvement. Without treatment, progressive RD causes blindness, especially if the macula is involved.",

To prevent neovascularization, CRVO must be treated with panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and/or steroids.

About 3 years ago, she stopped using her reading glasses for several months because her eyesight improved temporarily. She is a landscape painter. For the past year, she has mostly been working inside her studio instead of outside her house. She comments that “the bright sunlight makes me see halos around lights and then I cannot distinguish between the nuances of colors anymore.” The patient recently stopped driving at night because she no longer trusts her eyes. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and atrial fibrillation. She has smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years and occasionally drinks 1–2 glasses of wine. Her medications include metformin, albuterol, budesonide-formoterol, digoxin, and rivaroxaban. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 89/min and irregular, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination shows visual acuity of 20/80 in both eyes.

However, wet AMD affects one eye first rather than both eyes, and progresses over weeks to months rather than years. Additionally, this condition does not cause a temporary improvement in near vision, darkening of the red reflex, and obscuration of the ocular fundus. Finally, the visual impairment is usually central or pericentral and patients generally present with metamorphopsia and scotomas, none of which are seen here.",

Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of visual impairment in patients aged 25–74 years in the US and can also cause bilateral, progressive, painless vision loss. However, diabetic retinopathy is not associated with the visualization of halos around lights, a temporary improvement in near vision, or the darkening of the red reflex.

Advanced age, diabetes mellitus, and steroid use, all of which are seen in this patient, are known risk factors for open-angle glaucoma. However, a temporary improvement in near vision and a fundoscopy showing darkening of the red reflex and obscuration of ocular fundus are not expected. Additionally, in patients with open-angle glaucoma, the visual field loss progresses from peripheral to central over time, which is not seen here.",

However, acute angle-closure glaucoma is usually unilateral rather than bilateral, and patients typically present with a red, painful eye with a fixed pupil, which is not seen here. Additionally, the visual impairment has a sudden onset rather than a progressive course. Furthermore, beta blockers should be avoided in this patient with asthma because of the risk of bronchoconstriction.",

        "explanation_why": "In the case of spontaneous, nonbullous subconjunctival hemorrhage (SCH) without other symptoms (e.g., changes in visual acuity, photophobia, eye pain, foreign body sensation), no further diagnostic workup or treatment is needed. Spontaneous SCH typically occurs as a result of maneuvers that increase venous pressure in the eyeball (e.g., coughing, straining, heavy lifting, vomiting, Valsalva maneuver). Patients should be reassured that this condition, although sometimes appearing dramatic, resolves spontaneously when the blood is reabsorbed (usually within 2–3 weeks). The patient should be told that the area of hemorrhage may increase during the first days after SCH as a result of the redistribution of blood in the loculated subconjunctival space.\n\nIn the case of SCH associated with trauma, bullous SCH, or one of the aforementioned symptoms, further ophthalmologic workup is indicated, such as slit lamp examination to rule out conditions of the anterior eye (e.g., conjunctival lacerations, foreign bodies) and/or CT scan to rule out intraocular or intraorbital injury (e.g., globe rupture). Patients with recurrent spontaneous SCH should be evaluated for underlying conditions (e.g., poorly controlled hypertension, coagulopathies) and patients on an anticoagulation regimen should be evaluated for overmedication. SCH in young children can be a sign of child abuse.",

On slit-lamp examination, tear film break-up time is decreased. The results of a complete blood count show no abnormalities. Serum studies show positive antinuclear antibody titers, negative anti-Smith and anti-dsDNA antibody titers, and IgG4 antibody titers that are within the reference range. An ECG and a CT scan of the chest show no abnormalities. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",

The most common renal complications of primary SS are tubulointerstitial nephritis and type 1 renal tubular acidosis. Glomerular involvement in primary SS is rare and, when it does occur, typically manifests as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or membranous nephropathy, not FSGS.",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with Sjogren syndrome (SS) have an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the exocrine glands, particularly the parotid gland. The most important risk factor for lymphoma development in SS is persistent salivary gland enlargement. Although the pathophysiology of lymphoma development in SS is not entirely known, B-cell activation and chronic inflammation are thought to play a role. MALT lymphoma is the most common lymphoma in patients with SS, followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Other common complications in patients with SS are related to xerostomia and include gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrophic oral candidiasis, and increased risk of dental caries. Patients with SS can develop a dry cough as a result of xerotrachea and xerobronchitis (the most likely cause in this patient with a normal chest CT) or interstitial lung disease. Patients with primary SS are often positive for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, both of which are specific types of ANA.\n\nParotid enlargement is more common in primary than in secondary SS.",

A dry cough may also be seen in IgG4-related disease as a result of interstitial lung disease. However, positive antinuclear antibody titers are not seen in IgG4-related disease. Instead, serum IgG4 antibody titers are often well above the normal range (≥ 2 times the upper limit). RPF is not typically associated with primary SS, the diagnosis in this patient.",

However, negative anti-Smith and anti-dsDNA antibody titers indicate a different cause for increased ANA titers. Moreover, patients with SLE usually have a malar or discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers (rather than tongue fissures), arthralgia, and/or hematological abnormalities, none of which this patient has. Primary SS has been reported to cause autoimmune myocarditis but is not associated with LSE.",

He had no other symptoms and says he has never had a similar episode before. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 48 years and drinks one beer daily. Current medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, and metformin. He is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 89 kg (196 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m^2. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 72/min and regular, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 148/91 mm Hg. Visual acuity is 20/32 bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye (N = 10–21). The pupil is reactive and the cornea and anterior chamber are clear. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a few microaneurysms, increased tortuosity of the retinal arterioles, and bright yellow, refractile bodies at the bifurcations of the retinal arterioles. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's loss of vision?",

However, these spots would be clustered around the macula rather than the bifurcations of the retinal arterioles and dry AMD does not cause acute visual impairment.\n\nWet AMD can lead to subretinal hemorrhage, manifesting with acute monocular visual impairment. This patient does not have subretinal hemorrhage or any other signs of wet AMD (e.g., gray-green retinal discoloration, serous detachment of the retina) on fundoscopic examination and contrary to this patient's presentation, visual impairment after subretinal hemorrhage resolves slowly over several weeks.",

He was born at 39 weeks' gestation to a 23-year-old woman gravida 1, para 1, after an uncomplicated delivery. Two weeks ago, his mother noticed a “thick yellow-green discharge” from his left eye that was treated at home with teabag compressions. The mother has no medical insurance and did not receive prenatal care. The patient appears irritable. He is at the 50th percentile for length and weight. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 65/min, and blood pressure is 80/55 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Physical examination shows short, repetitive episodes of cough with brief inspirations between each cough. Bilateral, diffuse crackles are heard on auscultation of the chest. There is mild swelling of the left eyelid. Polymerase chain reaction tests of nasopharyngeal and ocular secretions are positive for the same pathogen. Which of the following is the most likely causal microorganism?",

However, gonococcal conjunctivitis typically manifests in newborns 2–7 days after delivery, whereas this patient's presentation began after 2 weeks. In addition to neonatal conjunctivitis, N. gonorrhea infection can cause disseminated gonococcal infection and septic arthritis, but not pneumonia.",

Patients may be afebrile or only have a low-grade fever during the prodromal phase. However, croup is characterized by hoarseness and inspiratory stridor, rather than crackles, and it more commonly affects children 6 months to 3 years of age.

Young infants are also at higher risk of developing complications of pertussis, such as pneumonia, and a lack of prenatal care (e.g., third trimester Tdap immunization) increases the risk of pertussis.

This patient has an internal hordeolum, which typically arises at the palpebral conjunctiva. External hordeolum is more common and typically arises at the lid margin. For both types of hordeolum, the first step in management is the application of warm compresses and gentle massage to promote drainage of the blocked gland. Additionally, eyelid margin hygiene (i.e., debris removal with a clean cotton swab) should be maintained. If the patient has severe symptoms or does not respond to conservative treatment after 1–2 weeks, an ophthalmologist should be consulted for incision and curettage and antibiotic treatment (e.g., topical gentamicin, systemic cephalexin).",

He had several similar episodes of loss of vision; as these episodes all resolved after some minutes, he did not follow up on them. He has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His father died from myocardial infarction at the age of 70 years. He has smoked up to one pack of cigarettes daily for 43 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage 3–5 days per week. Current medications include aspirin, nitroglycerin, lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and metformin. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 148/84 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination shows no perception of light in the right eye and 20/40 vision in the left eye. Corneal reflexes are brisk. The swinging flashlight test shows dilation of both pupils when the right eye is illuminated. Intraocular pressure is 17 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. Examination of the lids and conjunctiva shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. On auscultation, there is a bruit over the right carotid artery. Fundoscopy of the right eye shows the findings in the photograph. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The empiric antibiotic therapy should cover coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus (e.g., vancomycin plus ceftazidime), which are the most common causative pathogens. In patients with severe vision loss, pars plana vitrectomy is indicated, and the tissue removed via vitrectomy should be sent for culture.

There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is topical hydrocortisone. Immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F). Ophthalmologic examination shows erythema, tenderness, and swelling of the right eyelid; there is mild conjunctival injection. The pupils are equal and reactive to light; extraocular muscles are intact and their movement is not painful. Examination of the left eye shows no abnormalities. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. There is purulent nasal discharge. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This condition is commonly preceded by upper respiratory tract infections such as bacterial rhinosinusitis, but it can also develop as a result of a contiguous local soft tissue infection (e.g., due to dacryocystitis, insect or animal bites, or local trauma). Typical manifestations include ocular pain and unilateral eyelid erythema and swelling; chemosis and fever are less commonly seen. While diagnosis is primarily clinical, a CT scan of the orbits and sinuses should be performed if there is evidence of orbital cellulitis, or if symptoms are severe (e.g., marked eyelid swelling, high fever, leukocytosis) or fail to regress under adequate therapy. Treatment consists of oral antibiotics with coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and close outpatient follow-up.",

        "explanation_why": "Concave lenses are used to correct myopia. The increased axial length of the eye in myopia results in the focal point of an image being anterior to the retina, leading to blurry far vision and clear near vision. Concave lenses diverge incoming light, allowing it to be focused on the retina. Although mild myopia does not always require correction, this patient's myopia with 20/40 vision has affected his daily activities (school performance) and, therefore, needs treatment. Asymptomatic children with severe myopia should also use corrective lenses in order to prevent bilateral refractive amblyopia.",

            "description": "Deviations in eye anatomy that affect refractory media (e.g., axial length of the eye, cornea curvature) can result in refractive errors.Emmetropia: The axial length of the eye and refractive power are balanced, resulting in a focal point on the retina.Myopia: An increased axial length of the eye or increased refractive power results in a focal point anterior to the retina. Near objects can be seen clearly but distant objects are blurred. This can be corrected using a concave (diverging) lens.Hyperopia: A decreased axial length of the eye or decreased refractive power results in a focal point posterior to the retina. Distant objects and even near objects may be seen clearly depending on the ability of the lens to accommodate (generally, the younger the individual, the greater the ability to accommodate) and the degree of hyperopia. Hyperopia can be corrected using a convex (converging) lens.",

Additional indications for surgical excision include progressive growth and persistent irritation that is resistant to conservative therapy. A small pterygium that does not require surgery can be managed with UV protection measures (e.g., wearing sunglasses and a hat) and ocular lubricants (e.g., artificial tears) to reduce foreign body sensation and chronic irritation.

    "hint": "Painless vision loss with photopsia (flashing lights) and the funduscopic findings of fluffy, hemorrhagic, perivascular retinal lesions that radiate out from the optic disc (pizza-pie appearance) are characteristic of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, which typically occurs in immunocompromised patients. A history of high-risk sexual behavior, oral candidiasis (white plaques that are easily scraped off), and findings of CMV retinitis suggest an HIV infection in this patient.",

        "explanation_why": "Valganciclovir or ganciclovir are considered first-line therapy for CMV retinitis. which usually occurs unilaterally but can affect the other eye if untreated. Alternative agents include foscarnet and cidofovir. In patients with severe infection (e.g., lesions < 1.5 mm from the fovea or adjacent to the optic nerve head), intravitreal therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet should also be considered. In HIV-positive patients, manifestations of severe CMV disease such as retinitis, esophagitis, colitis, pneumonitis, and encephalitis usually occur when the CD4+ T-cell count is < 50/mm^3. Patients with HIV infection should also be started on antiretroviral therapy to increase the CD4+ T-cell count.\n\nSee “Ophthalmologic complications of HIV” table.",

Varicella zoster retinitis causes vitreous opacification and yellow-white retinal patches starting from the periphery rather than the extensive retinal hemorrhagic lesions seen in this patient. Patients with herpes simplex keratitis and herpes zoster ophthalmicus would have corneal ulceration on slit lamp examination. Acyclovir is not effective against CMV.",

This condition predominantly affects children and young adults and occurs days to weeks after a viral infection or vaccination due to cross-reactivity between a viral and myelin antigen. ADEM is characterized by rapid onset and progression of neurological deficits and altered mental status. Patients often have a fever, and CSF analysis typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein levels. Although the brain is primarily affected, patients can also develop optic neuritis, as seen here, and transverse myelitis. Characteristic neuroimaging findings are multiple poorly defined lesions in deep and subcortical white matter. A CT scan may show parenchymal lesions but is often nondiagnostic, and an MRI is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy for 3–5 days.",

The lesions are predominantly located within the white matter (example indicated by green overlay). In addition to these lesions in the supratentorial region, further hyperintense lesions are visible in the midbrain (example indicated by red overlay), indicating infratentorial involvement.Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating condition. It is difficult to differentiate from other inflammatory conditions, especially multiple sclerosis, and tissue diagnosis may be the only way to confirm diagnosis. An immunologic trigger may be present in the clinical history. An infection from the dental procedure in this case may have been the trigger for ADEM.",
