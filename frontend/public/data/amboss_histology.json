This patient's age, clinical presentation, lab values, and t(15;17) translocation indicate AML, which is why the cells of his bone marrow aspirate will likely stain positive for MPO. Another characteristic feature of AML is Auer rods, which are particularly associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia can be treated with vitamin A derivates such as ATRA (all-trans-retinoic acid).",

Gliadin is deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and then ingested by antigen-presenting cells (APC), which activate T cells via MHC II receptors. The activated T cell then activates plasma cells to release anti-tTG, anti-endomysial, and anti-deamidated gliadin antibodies (which all function as diagnostic markers of celiac disease). T cells also differentiate into TH1 cells, which activate cytoplasmic fibroblasts to release matrix proteases. This leads to the destruction of the intestinal architecture with villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and the loss of the brush border.",

            "description": "Photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear (May-Grunwald Giemsa stain; very high magnification)Multiple atypical lymphocytes (examples indicated by blue circles) can be seen among numerous normal erythrocytes (examples indicated by white arrowheads) in the center of the image. The cell membrane of these lymphocytes feature fine, hair-like cytoplasmic projections (examples indicated by black arrowheads) and enlarged nuclei with slightly irregular borders (examples indicated by dashed line). A binuclear cell is also present (arrow).The presence of atypical lymphocytes with hair-like cytoplasmic projections in a peripheral blood smear indicates hairy cell leukemia. The diagnosis was confirmed on immunophenotyping.",

        "explanation_why": "Bone marrow fibrosis is the end result of primary myelofibrosis, a disorder characterized by increased fibroblast activity and connective tissue deposition in the bone marrow; it is positive for a JAK2 gene mutation in about 50% of cases. Teardrop cells seen on peripheral blood smear reflect altered bone marrow architecture, which causes red blood cells to become deformed as they leave the marrow to enter the circulation. Splenomegaly is also common in primary myelofibrosis due to extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. A 'dry tap' on bone marrow biopsy would be expected due to extensive medullary fibrosis.\n\nA JAK-2 gene mutation is also associated with other myeloproliferative neoplasms, including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.",

The bullae are formed due to an immune reaction caused by autoantibodies directed against bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 and bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (components of the hemidesmosome). Microscopic examination of a blistering lesion usually reveals the presence of eosinophils with the separation of tissue layers subepidermally causing tense bullae.\n\nBullous pemphigoid is a benign disease that usually responds well to treatment with high-dose topical steroids.",

        "explanation_why": "Decidualized endometrium without chorionic villi is a classic endometrial biopsy finding in ectopic pregnancy, in which the embryo implants outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube. Progesterone from the corpus luteum still acts on the endometrium, causing enlargement and secretory transformation of stromal cells (decidualization). Fetal structures (chorionic villi) are absent because the gestational sac is not in the uterus. \n\nRisk factors for ectopic pregnancy include prior ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal surgery, smoking, and advanced maternal age. Although intrauterine devices (IUDs) decrease the overall likelihood of pregnancy, individuals who do become pregnant with an IUD in situ are more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy than those without an IUD.",

            "description": "GTD is a group of diseases that originate in the placenta and typically result from abnormal fertilization of the ovum. Complete and partial moles may develop malignant traits and become invasive. Choriocarcinoma may be preceded by hydatidiform moles (50% of cases), ectopic pregnancy or miscarriages, or normal pregnancy. Theca lutein cysts result from exaggerated stimulation of the theca interna cells of the ovarian follicles due to excessive amounts of beta-hCG.",

Early morning serum cortisol levels are elevated and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is within the reference range after a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test shows suppression of ACTH. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient has signs of Cushing syndrome: weight gain with central obesity, abdominal striae, hypertension, hyperpigmentation, and irregular menses. A positive low-dose dexamethasone suppression test indicates hypercortisolism. A serum ACTH within the reference range in this context is considered abnormal, as ACTH secretion should physiologically be suppressed by elevated serum cortisol levels. Suppression of ACTH with high-dose dexamethasone confirms increased ACTH production from the pituitary gland (Cushing disease).",

Even though this patient has menstrual irregularity, she does not have clinical features of hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency, nor risk factors for Sheehan syndrome (e.g., recent pregnancy), and her serum ACTH level does not align with hypopituitarism.",

However, unlike ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome, adrenocortical cancer does not induce skin hyperpigmentation as there is no increased collateral melanocyte stimulating hormone secretion.

Patients with AMAG are also at increased risk for carcinoid tumors because of the presence of autoantibodies against parietal cells, which normally produce gastric acid. The resulting achlorhydria stimulates the release of gastrin and antral G-cell hyperplasia, resulting in hypergastrinemia. Hypergastrinemia, in turn, is associated with enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, which may progress to gastric carcinoid tumor.",

Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is hypothesized that obesity increases the risk of adenocarcinoma by increasing the risk of reflux and via mechanisms independent of reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux disease induces metaplasia (Barrett esophagus), which can progress to adenocarcinoma. In addition, excessive visceral fat increases the risk of inflammation, the production of cytokines and growth factors, and insulin resistance, all of which are risk factors for carcinoma. Other risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma include smoking, achalasia, and certain diets (high in animal protein or cholesterol, low in fiber).

        "explanation_why": "Chagas disease is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by inoculation of fecal material of the triatomine reduvid bug into skin or mucous membranes. The reduvid bug preferentially bites on the face (“kissing bug”). The Romana sign occurs when the portal of entry of T. cruzi is the conjunctiva or eyelid. The pathogen subsequently disseminates via the bloodstream. Staining this patient's peripheral blood with stains that contain aniline dyes (e.g, Giemsa stain, Wright stain) would likely reveal the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes. Treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is necessary to prevent complications of Chagas disease such as dilated cardiomyopathy, megaesophagus, and acute megacolon.",

Crohn disease can manifest with nonbloody chronic diarrhea, fatigue, lower abdominal pain, weight loss, and anemia. However, characteristic colonoscopic findings include multiple, sharply delineated areas of inflammation and intervening areas of normal mucosa. The delineated regions coalesce to form long, serpiginous ulcers between normal mucosa, thus giving the mucosa a cobblestone appearance. Small aphthous ulcerations arranged in a longitudinal fashion may also be present. This patient's colonoscopic findings indicate UC, which is associated with ASCAs in only 20% of cases.",

Cavernous hemangioma of the liver is the most common benign hepatic tumor and is typically seen in women aged 30–50 years. While most patients with hepatic hemangiomas are asymptomatic, a large hepatic hemangioma can compress the adjacent bowel (causing early satiety) and stretch the Glisson capsule (causing upper abdominal pain). Because hepatic hemangiomas are highly vascular, they typically appear as hyperechoic masses on ultrasonography. Needle aspiration or biopsy should be avoided in the diagnostic workup of hepatic hemangiomas due to the risk of hemorrhage.",

Inflammatory cytokines attract macrophages, which then form foam cells by taking up cholesterol from oxidized low-density lipids. These foam cells accumulate to form fatty streaks (early atherosclerotic lesions). Finally, collagen production by lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells form these fatty streaks into a fibrous plaque.",

TA is more common among women with Asian ancestry, and its peak incidence is between 15 and 45 years of age. This condition manifests with systemic features that include fever, malaise, and arthralgia. Other features of TA include decreased brachial and radial pulses (pulseless disease), syncope, carotid bruit, angina pectoris, impaired vision, and Raynaud phenomenon, all of which are due to narrowing of the large arteries. Erythema nodosum and urticaria may also be seen in TA. Microscopic examination of the diseased vessels would show granulomatous inflammation of the vessel walls, with inflammatory cells infiltrating the tunica media and tunica adventitia.\n\nPatients with Takayasu arteritis should be treated with corticosteroids.",

The peripheral blood smear finding of neutrophilia raises suspicion for a bacterial etiology. In response to bacterial infection, neutrophils demarginate from the vascular endothelium and are released from the bone marrow. This results in an increased concentration of neutrophils in the blood (i.e., neutrophilia) as they migrate to sites of infection to clear bacteria via phagocytosis. The bone marrow also increases neutrophil production, which can result in the presence of immature predecessors, such as band cells, in the blood (i.e., left shift).",

This condition can be idiopathic or triggered by certain drugs (e.g., cephalosporins, sulfasalazine), infections (e.g., HIV, HCV), or autoimmune diseases (e.g., SLE). Diagnosis requires ruling out systemic vasculitis. A skin biopsy typically revealing leukocytoclastic vasculitis is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves management of the underlying cause (e.g., discontinuation of causative drugs). Immunosuppressive therapy may be required depending on disease severity and chronicity.",

Patients with EGPA typically present with asthma attacks, tender nodules, mononeuritis multiplex, and gastrointestinal, cardiac (e.g., pericarditis), and/or renal involvement (e.g., elevated BUN and creatinine). Constitutional symptoms (e.g., fatigue, fever) are also common in EGPA. Moreover, blood tests typically show eosinophilia and are often positive for p-ANCA.",

Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6° F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 2-cm (0.8-in) nodule on the right side of her neck that moves with swallowing. Serum TSH concentration is 0.2 μU/mL. Ultrasound shows a 2.3-cm (0.91-in) hypoechoic mass in the right thyroid lobe. Thyroid scintigraphy reveals a nodule with decreased radiotracer uptake. Fine-needle aspiration cytology shows concentric lamellar calcifications, large oval nuclei with central clearing, and lymphocytic infiltration. Molecular genetic testing showed no BRAF mutations. Which of the following factors in this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?",

However, an older age at diagnosis is associated with a poor prognosis for papillary, follicular, and medullary thyroid cancers. The TNM staging system uses an age cutoff of ≥ 55 years to identify patients with a high risk of mortality from these cancers. Other factors indicating a poor prognosis include male sex, large tumor (i.e., > 4 cm), extrathyroidal growth, lymph node involvement with extranodal extension, multifocality, specific molecular characteristics (such as RAS and BRAF mutations), and certain histopathological features (e.g., tall cells, poor differentiation, and vascular infiltration).",

She has noted progressive swelling in the area but has not had fever, night sweats, weight loss, or pruritus. She has no cough, dyspnea, or chest pain. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She emigrated from Peru five years ago. Family history is unremarkable. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She appears healthy. BMI is 22 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 121/64 mm Hg. Examination shows a firm, nontender, mobile 3-cm lymph node in the right axilla; there is no hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies, including complete blood count and metabolic panel, are within normal limits. Excisional lymph node biopsy findings show hyaline vascular proliferation with regressed germinal centers and prominent capillaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by localized, non-tender lymphadenopathy, most commonly in the mediastinum or axilla. The unicentric form is typically asymptomatic, with normal laboratory findings, and involves a single lymph node. Histopathology findings show a regressed (atrophic) germinal center surrounded by concentric layers of small lymphocytes (onion-skin appearance) and prominent capillary proliferation with hyalinized walls. The disease is benign but may require surgical excision for definitive treatment.\n\nMulticentric Castleman disease manifests with systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss) and hepatosplenomegaly and is more common in patients with HIV and HHV-8 coinfection.",

While this patient has cervical lymphadenopathy, he does not have pruritus, B symptoms, or organomegaly. Moreover, histopathology findings show Reed-Sternberg cells (large cells with binuclear or bilobed nuclei with dark centers of chromatin and pale halos, which result in an owl-eye appearance), rather than hyaline vascular proliferation with regressed germinal centers.",
