        "explanation_why": "With advancing age, the ability of the body to mount antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to a new antigen decreases. This is caused by a decline in the counts of most subsets of B cells and T cells. The decreased immune response is also caused by impaired affinity maturation and V(D)J recombination, an increase in the proportion of monoclonal cell lines, and decreased affinity of antibodies for new antigens due to a decrease in the variety of B-cell receptors for antigens. These changes lead to an increased need for booster vaccinations in older adults.",

The pain is worse at the end of the day and is relieved by walking or elevating her feet. Two years ago, she developed acute deep vein thrombosis in her right calf after a long flight, which was treated with anticoagulants for 6 months. Physical examination shows 2+ pitting edema of her right leg. The skin around the right ankle shows a reddish-brown discoloration and multiple telangiectasias. She has dilated varicose veins in the right leg. Which of the following is most likely to establish the diagnosis?",

Older adults, especially those with dementia, are at increased risk for abuse. Older adult abuse is most commonly perpetrated by caregivers (e.g., spouse, nursing home staff) and can be physical, psychological, or financial, or take the form of neglect. Physicians are legally and ethically obligated to report suspected abuse. When a physician suspects abuse, they should privately speak with the affected patient, ask for further information, and offer assistance.\n\nFinally, this patient's decreased MCV and hemoglobin are consistent with microcytic anemia (e.g., due to insufficient iron intake) but do not indicate an increased bleeding risk.",

The S1 nerve root controls plantar flexion through the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, so weakness in these muscles can lead to a diminished Achilles tendon reflex and impaired toe walking. Additionally, the S1 nerve root controls sensation in the dorsolateral aspect of the thigh, the posterior calf, and the lateral side of the foot, which explains this patient's radiating pain in these regions.",

This results in thickened cortical bone that nevertheless breaks easily. Typical clinical manifestations are cranial nerve palsies, and pancytopenia, none of which is seen in this patient.

Increased susceptibility to glare is a finding of normal aging, most likely due to the effects of intraocular light scatter.

This accounts for increased skin laxity and rigidity. Atrophy of the dermis due to loss of collagen and volume deficit as a result of reduced glycosaminoglycan synthesis further contribute to the appearance of chronologically aged skin. Moreover, aging skin is prone to xerosis secondary to moisture loss resulting from diminished lipid and sebum production at the surface.",

Since GAGs maintain skin structure and moisture, decreased synthesis results in loss of volume and hydration, as well as the development of wrinkles and folds. Moreover, a decrease in fibroblast activity contributes to delayed wound healing.",

Absence of decompensated liver failure features (e.g., jaundice, ascites) in this patient suggests that her parkinsonian features have a different pathogenesis.",

Although α-synuclein dysfunction is a key process in PD pathogenesis, the factors instigating neurodegeneration and the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons are multifaceted and still under investigation.",

Affected patients usually present with an acute intention tremor, i.e., it worsens with goal-directed movements, which causes dysmetria while performing the finger-nose test. Other signs of cerebellar dysfunction (e.g., nystagmus, abnormal gait, dysdiadochokinesia) would also be present. This patient has none of these features and her insidious onset of symptoms suggests that her current condition is of a different pathogenesis.",
        "explanation_but": "The blood supply of the cerebellum consists of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries (PICAs), branches of the vertebral artery, and the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries (AICAs) and the superior cerebellar arteries (SCAs), which arise from the basilar artery. Cerebellar infarcts require special attention because of the danger of cerebral edema within the posterior fossa, which can compress the brain stem causing potentially fatal transtentorial herniation (of the superior vermis through the tentorial notch) or downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils (through the foramen magnum).",

He has osteoarthritis of both knees and type 2 diabetes mellitus but is otherwise healthy. His medications include metformin and naproxen as needed. He would like to start a short-term trial of a medication for his sleeping problems but does not want to take any drugs with a high risk of side effects. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This 76-year-old patient presents with sleep-onset insomnia that is resistant to nonpharmacological interventions. Pharmacotherapy should generally be limited to several weeks and must be used cautiously, especially in older adults (> 65 years) because of the high risk of adverse effects. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient acts on the suprachiasmatic nucleus.",

Nonbenzodiazepines are effective for treating sleep onset insomnia and/or sleep maintenance insomnia, depending on their half-life. Zolpidem has a half-life of up to 4.5 hours and is associated with an increased risk of falls in older individuals, making it inappropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.",

Important causes of reduced renal artery blood flow include renal artery stenosis, external compression of the renal arteries (e.g., by a tumor or cyst), atherosclerosis of the renal arteries, and fibromuscular dysplasia. While atherosclerosis of the renal arteries should be considered given the patient's age, his normal diastolic pressures make another underlying cause more likely. Furthermore, only bilateral renal artery disease resulting in a significant decrease in GFR would manifest with hypertension; this patient's normal creatinine makes such a decrease unlikely.",

Chest wall compliance typically decreases because of increased chest wall stiffness. Stiffening of the chest wall and loss of elastic recoil impair lung emptying during expiration, which results in increased residual volume. When compared to a healthy young adult, individuals of advanced age have increased alveolar dead space and V/Q mismatch due to age-related loss of lung surface area. Moreover, while aging classically leads to a decrease in FEV_1  and vital capacity, total lung capacity usually remains unchanged.\n\nOther age-related changes include decreased respiratory muscle strength (which can hinder effective coughing and increase the risk of aspiration and infection) and impaired ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.",

His symptoms started with misplacing items such as his wallet and keys around the house. Two months ago, he became unable to manage their finances as it became too difficult for him. Last week, he became lost while returning home from the grocery store. His wife reports that he shows “no emotion” and that he is seemingly not concerned by his recent symptoms. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and rosuvastatin. His pulse is 56/min and blood pressure is 158/76 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows loss of sensation on his right leg and an unsteady gait. When asked to stand with his eyes closed and palms facing upward, his right arm rotates inward. An MRI of the brain shows multiple deep white matter lesions.

The primary pathogenesis of this disease is atherosclerosis, for which diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and uncontrolled hypertension are risk factors. The diagnosis is further supported by the presence of neurologic deficits on examination, such as right-sided pronator drift, numbness in the right leg, and unsteady gait. The multiple deep white matter lesions on cranial MRI represent previous lacunar infarcts.",

Although cerebral atrophy is often bilateral in frontotemporal dementia, it can be asymmetrical, as demonstrated in this example.Because the majority of people develop some degree of brain atrophy as a part of normal aging, correlation with the clinical history is essential for this condition.",

However, this patient's diabetes is well-controlled, and diabetic autonomic neuropathy causes a flaccid neurogenic bladder (urinary retention with overflow incontinence) by impairing bladder filling sensation and decreasing sphincter tone. Irregular, small-volume leakage of urine without an urge to void would be expected in this condition. An enlarged prostate in this patient suggests a different diagnosis.",

Rectal examination may reveal an enlarged prostate. However, the prostate is usually extremely tender on palpation. In addition, acute prostatitis typically manifests with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, dysuria, and pelvic or perineal pain, none of which is seen in this patient.

However, it typically manifests with a nodular, not smooth, prostate. In addition, prostate cancer is generally slow-growing and most commonly located in the periphery of the prostate, not close to the urethra. Symptoms of urethral compression (e.g., weak stream), therefore, typically only occur in patients with advanced disease. This patient does not have manifestations of advanced prostate cancer (e.g., fatigue, weight loss, hematuria, bone pain from metastatic disease).",

BPH causes compression of the urethra, which leads to bladder outlet obstruction. Incomplete voiding results in urinary stasis, which predisposes to urinary tract infections. Patients who are suspected of having BPH should receive a urinalysis to evaluate for UTI and hematuria. First-line treatment of BPH consists of behavioral modifications (e.g., restriction of fluid intake before bedtime, avoidance of caffeine and alcohol) and pharmacologic therapy with alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin).",

    "question_text": "A 71-year-old man comes to the physician because of decreased sexual performance for the past 2 years. He reports that it takes longer for his penis to become erect, and he cannot maintain an erection for as long as before. His ejaculations have become less forceful. Once he has achieved an orgasm, he requires several hours before he can have another orgasm. He has been happily married for 40 years and he has no marital conflicts.

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "According to the Beers criteria, physicians should avoid prescribing ≥ 3 CNS-active drugs in geriatric patients because combining these drugs can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, and delirium, which can increase the risk of falls and resulting fractures. CNS-active drugs include antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, SNRIs), antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, and opioids. Older patients are especially sensitive to benzodiazepines. This patient's orthostatic presyncope and hearing loss are also risk factors for falls. In addition, there is a higher risk of fractures in this patient, who has risk factors for decreased bone mineral density (e.g., postmenopausal woman, glitazone use).\n\nPolypharmacy is often unavoidable in older patients because of the presence of multiple comorbidities but can sometimes occur as a result of a prescription cascade. Polypharmacy is associated with a greater risk of poor patient compliance, medical errors, decreased therapeutic efficacy, and/or adverse drug reactions (due to drug-drug interactions). Strategies to avoid polypharmacy and its complications include adherence to the Beers criteria, medication reconciliation, and periodic medication reviews with the use of drug-interaction checkers.",

He has nontremor-dominant Parkinson disease that was diagnosed at the age of 68 after developing progressive bradykinesia and rigidity. He lives alone following the death of his wife 2 years ago. The patient's son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren live nearby and help him with daily activities. Current medications include levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. He appears well. Neurologic examination shows mild hypomimia, bradydiadochokinesia, shortened steps, and mild gait shuffling. During the examination, the patient mentions that he drove himself to his appointment today because he does not want to feel like a burden on his son. The physician is concerned that the patient's illness and medications potentially impair his driving skills. The patient stresses that he has never had an accident in his life and is a very safe driver. He also states that he has felt isolated since his wife's passing and likes to meet up with old friends at a local bar. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "A physician should encourage patients to communicate with their family members and seek help when necessary. However, it is inappropriate for the physician to presume that the patient's son would be willing to drive for the patient. The physician should instead explore the patient's reasons for feeling like a burden on his son, rather than simply instructing him not to feel this way. Moreover, in this case, it is critical to inform the patient that his current condition impairs his ability to drive safely; a different reaction would, therefore, be appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Irrespective of state laws, if a physician believes that a patient cannot drive safely, the physician must share their concerns with the patient and ask them to stop driving until they have been evaluated and treated by a driver rehabilitation specialist. Alternatively, the patient can be recleared for driving by the state licensing authority (e.g., Department of Motor Vehicles). However, the laws for reporting impaired drivers differ between states.\n\nMost states have voluntary reporting laws, under which a physician is not required to disclose a patient's driving impairment to the state licensing authority but are protected from a breach of patient confidentiality if they do so. Some states have mandatory reporting laws, which require physicians to report any patient with driving impairment to the state licensing authority. In states with voluntary or mandatory reporting laws, the physician can be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not report the driving impairment. A few states do not have any reporting laws and require the physician to obtain the patient's consent before disclosing driving impairment to the authorities. In these states, the physician cannot be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not have consent to disclose driver impairment.",

This condition is caused by age-related damage to hair cells at the base of the cochlea. Although otoscopy and audiometry would eventually be indicated to establish the diagnosis, high-frequency hearing loss is an expected finding in older patients and does not require immediate investigation.",

Causes for vertical nystagmus include vestibular conditions (e.g., anterior and posterior semicircular canal BPPV), severe alcohol intoxication, drug side effects (e.g., phencyclidine, lithium, carbamazepine, phenytoin), Wernicke encephalopathy, and CNS lesions (e.g., bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia in multiple sclerosis, cerebellar lesions). In contrast, although horizontal nystagmus is most frequently pathological, it can occur physiologically (e.g., end-gaze nystagmus) in all age groups. Other neurophthalmological findings considered normal in older patients (especially those aged over 80 years) are sluggish convergence, sluggish pupillary reflex, decreased upward gaze (while lateral and downward movements usually remain intact), and impaired accommodation (presbyopia).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Fecal impaction is most commonly seen in older adults with reduced mobility, such as this patient. The initial management of fecal impaction involves manual fragmentation of the compacted feces. This procedure can be followed with warm water or mineral oil enemas to soften the stool and facilitate further evacuation of the colon. Once the fecal impaction is treated, lifestyle modifications such as a high-fiber diet and physical therapy should be initiated, together with a maintenance bowel regimen (e.g., osmotic laxative therapy) to prevent recurrence. Untreated fecal impaction can lead to complications such as intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, stercoral ulcers, stercoral colitis, and fistulas.\n\nDigital rectal examination may not detect a fecal impaction if the location is in the proximal rectum or sigmoid colon. In these cases, an x-ray of the abdomen may show large, speckled, low-density opacities within distended loops of the large bowel and rectum.",

The prevalence is 50–60% in individuals aged over 50 years and increases with age. The etiology of skin tags is not fully understood, but they tend to affect areas of the body that experience friction, such as the lower neck, axilla, inframammary fold, and inguinal region. Skin tags are also associated with diabetes and obesity and may be a sign of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Because skin tags are benign lesions, intervention is typically not necessary, but they may be removed for cosmetic purposes using fine-grade scissors, cryosurgery, or electrodesiccation.",

She says that she has not lost consciousness but “simply tripped over a rock.” A similar event happened 2 weeks ago when she fell while grocery shopping. She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her family history is significant for Parkinson disease. She does not smoke cigarettes and drinks one to two glasses of wine each week. Current medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, aspirin, metformin, and empagliflozin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg. Examination shows an abrasion on her right knee and a deep cut on her right hand. Neurologic examination shows normal sensation to pinprick and vibration. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the left lower limb and 2+ in the right lower limb. She was able to get up out of her chair and walk to the wall and back to the chair without any problems. Which of the following is the most important risk factor for future falls in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's history of previous falls is the main risk factor for future falls. Falls in older individuals are usually due to a combination of age-related factors (e.g., lower-extremity weakness, cognitive and/or visual impairment), underlying medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson disease, osteoarthritis of the knee, orthostatic hypotension), and environmental hazards (e.g., slippery surfaces). Certain medications, such as benzodiazepines, increase the risk of falling. Patients who have fallen should undergo a risk assessment that involves testing of visual acuity, cognitive, neurological, musculoskeletal, and hearing function, postural vital signs, and past medical history including information about the circumstances of the current as well as previous falls. Strategies to prevent further falls include minimizing medications, physical therapy, and modifying the older individual's home environment.",

For asymptomatic lesions, such as the one seen here, treatment is generally not necessary and reassurance with follow-up is sufficient. If atypical features are present (e.g., asymmetry, rapid change or growth, ulceration) or if the diagnosis is unclear, a biopsy may be indicated. Treatment with cryotherapy, laser therapy, or surgical excision is appropriate for cosmetic removal or if the lesion becomes symptomatic (e.g., pruritic, painful, or bleeds easily).\n\nIn patients with the sudden appearance of multiple seborrheic keratoses, known as the Leser-Trélat sign, further investigation is necessary because of this feature's association with malignancies such as lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer.",

One month ago, he got lost in his own neighborhood and could not find his way home. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurocognitive testing shows he is alert and oriented to person and place but does not know the year or month. During the examination, the physician names three unrelated objects clearly and slowly. The physician then immediately asks the patient to repeat the names of all three objects. Which of the following cognitive domains is being tested by the described task?",

Bisphosphonates should be taken in the morning and evening at least 30 minutes before meals, with plenty of water, and the patient should maintain an upright position for at least 30 minutes following intake to prevent esophagitis. Other side effects are osteonecrosis of the jaw and hypocalcemia. Contraindications to bisphosphonates include hypocalcemia, esophageal abnormalities, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. In case of contraindications or unresponsiveness to bisphosphonates, medications such as parathyroid hormone analogs (teriparatide), selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene), or RANKL inhibitors (denosumab) may be used.\n\nSufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended as primary prevention and adjunct therapy for osteoporosis. Lifestyle modifications, such as physical activity (e.g., strength and balance training) and avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and glucocorticoids, should be encouraged.",

        "explanation_why": "Physical therapy is indicated in all older adults with evidence of poor gait, strength, or balance (e.g., patients with Parkinson disease). In addition to physical therapy, this patient would benefit from a fall risk assessment to identify more personalized preventive measures (e.g., occupational therapy, home hazard assessment and modification). Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in adults aged ≥ 65 years. All older adults should be counseled on fall prevention strategies and screened for fall risk annually, beginning with the question: “Have you fallen in the past year?” A fall risk assessment should be performed for individuals who screen positive for fall risk and those who present after an acute fall.",

    "question_text": "An 82-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for a routine examination. In the past 6 months, the patient was hospitalized twice because of a urinary tract infection. She has Alzheimer disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic urinary incontinence, for which she has an indwelling urinary catheter. She is bedridden and lives with her daughter, who is her next of kin. Current medications include rivastigmine and metformin. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 89/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is alert and oriented to person and place but not to time. She can name three objects shown by the physician and recalls two after 3 minutes. She makes multiple errors during a serial sevens test. The physician suggests replacing the indwelling urinary catheter with a suprapubic catheter in order to reduce the risk of further urinary tract infections. The physician informs the patient about the procedure as well as the risks and benefits of suprapubic catheter use compared to continued transurethral catheter use. The patient is able to repeat the information in her own words. When asked for her decision, she says “I will keep the current catheter because I do not want to undergo surgery.” Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

This includes an optimized intake of calcium and vitamin D, with recommended daily intakes of 1000–1200 mg of calcium and 800–1000 IU of vitamin D. Dietary sources are preferred over supplements unless a deficiency is present. Other preventive measures include physical exercise (e.g., strength training), smoking cessation, and limiting alcohol intake.\n\nScreening for osteoporosis is indicated in women ≥ 65 years and those with risk factors (e.g., long-term corticosteroid use).",

She has worn glasses for nearsightedness since adolescence and typically requires them for driving and distance vision. Recently, she has noticed that she does not need her glasses to read the newspaper or do close-up needlework. She reports no eye pain, redness, discharge, or floaters. Medical history is significant for hypertension treated with lisinopril. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Family history is unremarkable. She appears well. Visual acuity with her current distance correction is 20/20 in both eyes. Without correction, distance vision is 20/400 bilaterally. Near vision without correction is 20/25 in both eyes. Slit lamp examination shows no abnormalities. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in both eyes. Funduscopic examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's improved near vision?",

This condition can cause second sight, a temporary improvement in near vision without correction in previously myopic patients. Second sight occurs because the focal point of the lens shifts, partially compensating for its inability to accommodate. Visual acuity with distance correction remains normal.",

Cataract typically manifests with progressive, painless blurring of both distance and near vision, glare, and reduced acuity even with correction as the condition progresses. This patient presents with visual acuity with 20/20 distance correction, and slit lamp examination shows no abnormalities. Therefore, cataract is unlikely to be the cause of improved near vision in this patient.",

He has also noticed intermittent blood mixed with his stools and a change in bowel habits, alternating between constipation and diarrhea. Three years ago, he was treated with eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and celiac disease diagnosed at age 24 years. He follows a strict gluten-free, pescatarian diet. Medications are lisinopril, atorvastatin, and an iron supplement. He drinks one glass of wine every other day. His body mass index is 23 kg/m^2. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin concentration of 10.2 g/dL.

    "hint": "The photomicrograph shows hyperchromatic cells, nuclei with atypical features, desmoplasia, and colonic glands extending into the submucosa, all of which indicate colonic adenocarcinoma.

        "explanation_why": "Increasing age (> 40 years) is the most significant risk factor for colorectal adenocarcinoma, with peak incidence between 70–80 years of age. Colorectal cancer incidence rises sharply with age, as the accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations over time increases the likelihood of malignant transformation in colonic epithelial cells. Other risk factors include a history of adenomatous and serrated polyps, familial cancer syndromes (e.g., hereditary polyposis syndromes), inflammatory bowel disease, tobacco use, a diet of processed meat with low fiber, and heavy alcohol use. However, age remains the single strongest predictor of disease in older individuals without other risk factors. Therefore, screening guidelines prioritize older adults.",

The cells lining the colonic glands appear hyperchromatic, with basally oriented nuclei with atypical features. The lumen of these glands contains necrotic debris. The colonic glands, which are typically only present in the mucosal layer, are visible in the submucosa, but not beyond (pT1). Goblet cells are absent. (They would appear as unstained cells between the lining epithelial cells.) Desmoplasia is identifiable as fibrous tissue surrounding the tumor cells.Normal colonic mucosa is identifiable on the left third of the image as paler staining tissue.
