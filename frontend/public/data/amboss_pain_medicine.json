        "explanation_why": "Decreased pH and increased pCO_2 suggest a primary respiratory acidosis. The measured HCO_3^- (33 mEq/L) is consistent with a secondary metabolic alkalosis in the setting of primary acute respiratory acidosis because the measured HCO_3^- is more than what would be expected for acute respiratory acidosis (24 + [0.1 x (pCO_2  in mm Hg - 40)] +/- 3 = 24–30 mEq/L). Although this patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory acidosis due to an opioid overdose, there is, however, no history to suggest an additional metabolic alkalosis (e.g., diuretic use, severe vomiting).\n\nThe measured HCO_3^- is within the range of the expected HCO_3^- for a single chronic respiratory acidosis (24 + [0.4 x (pCO_2  in mm Hg - 40)] +/- 3 = 33–39 mEq/L) but the acute nature of an opioid overdose makes chronic respiratory acidosis unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "This ABG analysis suggests acute respiratory acidosis, which is seen in an opioid overdose as a result of hypoventilation. Decreased pH indicates acidosis, increased pCO_2 suggests a respiratory source and, due to the acute nature of an opioid overdose, only minimal metabolic compensation from the rapid action of buffers in blood would be expected. In acute respiratory acidosis, for every 10 mm Hg increase in pCO_2 above 40 mm Hg, the HCO_3^- concentration increases by 1 mEq/L from 24 mEq/L with an expected variability of +/- 3 mEq/L. A slow-onset but more substantial compensation occurs as a result of renal acid-base handling in chronic respiratory acid-base disorders.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for acute respiratory acidosis in the emergency department setting include airway obstruction (e.g., foreign body aspiration, acute exacerbations of obstructive lung diseases), neuromuscular etiologies (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic crisis, botulism), and overdoses with other drugs that can cause CNS depression (e.g., benzodiazepines).",

The pain occurs over her left cheek, is 9 out of 10 in intensity, radiates towards her mouth, and lasts around half a minute before subsiding. These episodes commonly occur when she washes her face, brushes her teeth, or eats a meal. She does not have visual disturbances, weakness of her facial muscles, or hearing loss. She had a tooth extracted about 2 months ago, but the facial pain has persisted. She has hypothyroidism and vitiligo. Her mother has major depressive disorder. Current medications include levothyroxine and herbal cream. She appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurological examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The efficacy of carbamazepine has been proven in several randomized controlled trials. However, it is not well tolerated by all patients because of its common side effects (e.g., hepatotoxicity, hematologic abnormalities, sedation, diplopia) and potential for drug interactions. Oxcarbazepine, which has similar efficacy and overall better tolerability, is another first-line agent for patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Surgical management (e.g., microvascular decompression) is usually reserved for patients who show no symptomatic improvement with medication therapy or who develop significant side effects.",

            "description": "Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by attacks of facial pain in the area of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. Classical trigeminal neuralgia is caused by neurovascular compression, most often by an aberrant loop of a neighboring artery (usually the superior cerebellar artery). The pain is typically very severe in intensity, has a sharp, stabbing quality, and lasts several seconds. Attacks can occur without provocation but are sometimes triggered by stimuli such as brushing teeth.",

Physical examination shows a 3 × 3 cm area of induration that is fluctuant and warm to the touch, consistent with an abscess. The patient consents to incision and drainage of the abscess in the emergency department. Following evaluation of the patient's allergy status, a local anesthetic drug of the amide group with a particularly long duration of action is administered via subcutaneous infiltration. Which of the following local anesthetics was most likely administered?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Anesthetic choice depends on several factors, including the duration of action required for the procedure, patient allergies, and the need for hemostasis. Many institutions use the same local anesthetic for most procedures, regardless of the duration of analgesia. However, this question asks specifically for a local anesthetic of the amide group that provides the longest duration of analgesia.",

In addition, the Whipple procedure is the first-line treatment option in patients with suspected pancreatic head carcinoma, which patients with chronic pancreatitis are at increased risk of developing. However, since this patient has not attempted conservative therapy for chronic pancreatitis, and the CT scan shows no evidence of pancreatic cancer (poorly defined masses with a surrounding fibrotic reaction), a surgical approach is inappropriate at this time.",

The condition is commonly seen in individuals who wear narrow or high-heeled footwear and is characterized by the presence of Mulder sign and Tinel sign.\n\nMorton neuroma is a clinical diagnosis based on history and provocation testing. If there is clinical uncertainty, imaging is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis or exclude alternative causes of chronic foot pain. Initial treatment includes reducing pressure on the metatarsal heads through wide footwear and orthotics. Other treatment options include ultrasound-guided corticosteroid and local anesthetic injections. Surgical resection of the neuroma may be necessary for symptomatic individuals who do not respond to other therapy modalities.",

The pain had been constant for months but has worsened over the past few weeks despite her taking hydrocodone 10 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg. She has chronic pain and major depressive disorder. In the past month, she has been taking her pain medications with increasing frequency, going from twice a day to four times a day. Her other medications include venlafaxine and eszopiclone. She describes her mood as low without suicidal ideation. She appears fatigued and cachectic. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 128/65 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a mass in the midepigastric region. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

A switch from hydrocodone to a stronger opioid (e.g., hydromorphone) is the appropriate next step according to the WHO analgesic ladder. When converting between opioids (opioid rotation), patients will likely have less tolerance to the new opioid than to their previous opioid (i.e., incomplete cross-tolerance). Therefore, the new opioid should be given at a 25–50% lower dose, then adjusted according to the patient's pain score. Additionally, this patient should continue taking ibuprofen, as nonopioid analgesics should be used at each step of the ladder for effective and balanced pain relief.\n\nSee “Management of pain using WHO analgesic ladder” table.",

The pain awakens him at night and is worse when he lies on the right shoulder. He does not have any paresthesia or numbness in the right arm. He is a painter, and these episodes of pain have not allowed him to work efficiently. He appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows painful abduction of the arm above the shoulder. There is severe pain when the elbow is flexed and the right shoulder is internally rotated. Elevation of the internally rotated and outstretched arm causes pain over the anterior lateral aspect of the shoulder. An x-ray of the shoulder shows no abnormalities. Injection of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine into the right subacromial space relieves the pain and increases the range of motion of the right arm.

The pain elicited in this patient is consistent with subacromial impingement syndrome. In addition, he lacks findings consistent with rotator cuff tear (e.g., loss of strength, displaced humeral head on x-ray), and he has not received prior therapy. An MRI of the shoulder is not indicated at this point.",

In patients who fail to improve with physical therapy and oral analgesics, subacromial glucocorticoid injections may provide symptomatic relief. If conservative therapy fails to improve symptoms, advanced imaging (e.g., MRI) should be obtained to rule out complications (e.g., rotator cuff tear), after which arthroscopic subacromial decompression can be considered.\n\nFor patients who present with shoulder pain, it is important to distinguish between impingement, tendinitis, and a tear of the rotator cuff.

    "question_text": "Four days after undergoing a total abdominal hysterectomy for atypical endometrial hyperplasia, a 59-year-old woman reports abdominal bloating and discomfort. She has also had nausea without vomiting. She has no appetite despite not having eaten since the surgery and drinking only sips of water. Her postoperative pain has been well controlled on a hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Her indwelling urinary catheter was removed on the second postoperative day and she is now voiding freely. Although she lies supine in bed for most of the day, she is able to walk around the hospital room with the help of a physical therapist. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 132/92 mm Hg. She is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 115 kg (253 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m^2. Examination shows a mildly distended, tympanic abdomen; bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. An x-ray of the abdomen shows uniform distribution of gas in the small bowel, colon, and rectum without air-fluid levels. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

She has also had nausea without vomiting. She has no appetite despite not having eaten since the surgery and drinking only sips of water. Her postoperative pain has been well controlled on a hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Her indwelling urinary catheter was removed on the second postoperative day and she is now voiding freely. Although she lies supine in bed for most of the day, she is able to walk around the hospital room with the help of a physical therapist. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 132/92 mm Hg. She is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 115 kg (253 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2. Examination shows a mildly distended, tympanic abdomen; bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. An x-ray of the abdomen shows uniform distribution of gas in the small bowel, colon, and rectum without air-fluid levels. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

    "hint": "This patient who has just had major abdominal surgery now has hypomobility of the gastrointestinal tract for more than three days after surgery. Her clinical picture (distended, tympanitic abdomen, absent bowel sounds) and imaging findings (uniform distribution of gas) suggest paralytic ileus.",

        "explanation_why": "Postoperative ileus is one of the most common causes of paralytic ileus. Intraabdominal surgery itself results in inflammation of the intestinal wall, impairing coordinated propulsive peristalsis of the intestinal smooth muscle. Opioids, such as the hydromorphone that was used for analgesia in this patient, also have an inhibitory effect on peristalsis, which has likely contributed to the development of paralytic ileus. Treatment consists mainly of supportive measures (i.e., bowel rest, using a nasogastric tube for intestinal decompression, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte correction). Drugs that might sustain or prolong paralytic ileus (e.g., anticholinergics, opioids) should be reduced or discontinued, if possible, while NSAIDs or acetaminophen should be administered for pain control.",

The pain is constant and she describes it as 9 out of 10 in intensity. She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic lower back pain. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals with moderate flow and last 4 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms inconsistently. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2–3 beers on weekends. Current medications include ranitidine, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and ibuprofen. The patient appears ill and does not want to move. Her temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 85/40 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended, tympanic abdomen with diffuse tenderness, guarding, and rebound; bowel sounds are absent. Her hematocrit is 32% and leukocyte count is 14,000/mm^3.

However, patients with an ectopic pregnancy typically become symptomatic 4–6 weeks after their last menstrual period (LMP), whereas this patient's LMP was only 2 weeks ago, making a symptomatic ectopic pregnancy unlikely. Furthermore, lower abdominal pain (typically unilateral) and signs of pregnancy (e.g., amenorrhea, nausea, breast tenderness, frequent urination) would be expected to precede symptoms of rupture.",

After perforation, gastric contents (including acid and bile) spill into the peritoneum, causing inflammation and pain. Long-term use of NSAIDs, as seen in this patient, increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease and subsequent stomach and/or duodenal perforation. Treatment consists of bowel rest, IV fluids, analgesics, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Some patients with localized peritonitis and no signs of sepsis can be managed conservatively; however, this patient has sepsis and severe peritoneal signs, which indicate that the perforation requires urgent surgical repair.",

Younger patients with AMI usually have several risk factors, such as arterial embolism (e.g., atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease), thrombosis (e.g., vasculitis, aortic aneurysm or dissection), decreased cardiac output (e.g., shock requiring vasopressors), and/or a hypercoagulable state, which are absent in this patient.

She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she stands up and walks around or moves her legs. These symptoms occur around 4 times a week. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Ferrous sulfate is an oral iron supplement used to replete iron stores. Because reduced levels of iron in the central nervous system are a consistent finding in RLS, evaluation of serum iron studies is an essential part of the workup of all patients. In patients with depleted iron stores, iron supplements can improve symptoms of RLS. However, only patients with serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL should take oral iron supplementation. This patient's iron studies were normal and, therefore, oral iron supplementation is not indicated.",

        "explanation_why": "Pharmacotherapy with alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands (e.g., gabapentin) is recommended for patients with chronic persistent RLS (i.e., moderate to severe symptoms that occur ≥ 2 x/week). Dopamine agonists are also effective but are considered second-line pharmacotherapy because of the risks associated with their use such as developing impulse control disorders or long-term augmentation (a paradoxical worsening of symptoms with increasing dose).\n\nAny underlying and/or comorbid conditions (e.g., iron deficiency) should be treated, and medications that may cause or aggravate RLS symptoms (e.g., H1 antihistamines) should be adjusted or discontinued. Furthermore, patients should be counseled on behavioral interventions that might improve RLS symptoms (e.g., sleep hygiene, exercise, avoiding coffee and alcohol).",

He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Parenteral antidopaminergic antiemetics such as metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are first-line agents for monotherapy for acute migraine attacks, especially if the migraine is associated with vomiting. These antiemetics effects have a direct abortive effect on migraine symptoms regardless of GI symptoms or ability to tolerate oral medication. In addition, they facilitate absorption of oral medications (e.g., NSAIDs). Oral antiemetics, on the other hand, are not as effective as monotherapy for acute migraine attacks. To prevent extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., akathisia), which are a potential side effect of these agents, intravenous diphenhydramine can be added to the treatment.\n\nBecause oral contraceptives (OCPs) are a potential trigger of migraine headaches, discontinuation should be discussed with this patient after successful treatment of her acute migraine attack. In addition, because of an increased risk of stroke, the use of combined OCPs is contraindicated in patients with migraines with aura and patients with migraines without aura but with other risk factors for stroke.",

It is her fifth such headache in the past 2 months. Her mother says that all the previous episodes started after soccer practice, following which the child would lock herself in her room, close the curtains, and sleep for a few hours. After waking up, the headache is either diminished or has stopped entirely. One month ago, the child was diagnosed with myopic vision and has been wearing glasses since. Her 4-year-old brother had herpetic gingivostomatitis 2 months ago. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Funduscopic examination is inconclusive because the child is uncooperative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "This child presents with a history of recurrent, debilitating, unilateral headache episodes, which seem to be provoked by physical activity and spontaneously resolve with sleep. These headaches appear to be associated with increased sensitivity to light (e.g., during funduscopy). The absence of fever, loss of consciousness, neurological deficits, or neck stiffness make migraine the most likely diagnosis in this patient.",

        "explanation_why": "Neuro-optometric assessment would be indicated for suspected refraction error, which may present with headache. Although this patient has myopia, she was recently evaluated and has been wearing corrective lenses; refractive error should not be contributing to her symptoms. In addition, the unilateral, recurrent, throbbing character of her headache suggests migraine, rather than ocular headache. Ocular headaches have a broad clinical presentation, but they tend to occur later in the day, especially after long periods of eye strain (e.g., after reading a book or working on a computer for hours).",

Near objects can be seen clearly but distant objects are blurred. This can be corrected using a concave (diverging) lens.Hyperopia: A decreased axial length of the eye or decreased refractive power results in a focal point posterior to the retina. Distant objects and even near objects may be seen clearly depending on the ability of the lens to accommodate (generally, the younger the individual, the greater the ability to accommodate) and the degree of hyperopia. Hyperopia can be corrected using a convex (converging) lens.",

Intracranial infection or hemorrhage manifests as acute, progressive headache, while headache associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension is usually positional (e.g., exacerbated by leaning forward or lying down).

Abortive therapy should be administered immediately, as it is most effective when taken at the onset of migraine. If the first agent (e.g., ibuprofen) fails to relieve symptoms, the other agent (e.g., acetaminophen) may also be given. A headache calendar should also be recommended to elucidate environmental triggers of headache (e.g., strenuous exercise, stress, certain food).",

This retraction elevates the patella, which is embedded in the quadriceps tendon, and leads to decreased quadriceps strength.

    "question_text": "A previously healthy 20-year-old woman comes to her physician because of pain during sexual intercourse. She recently became sexually active with her boyfriend. She has had no other sexual partners. She is frustrated because she has consistently been experiencing severe, sharp vaginal pain on penetration. She has tried lubricants without significant relief. She has not been able to use tampons in the past due to similar pain with tampon insertion. External vulvar examination shows no abnormalities. She is unable to undergo a bimanual or speculum examination due to tightening of the pelvic floor muscles and pain with attempted digit or speculum insertion. Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is negative. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "content_preview": "A previously healthy 20-year-old woman comes to her physician because of pain during sexual intercourse. She recently became sexually active with her boyfriend. She has had no other sexual partners. She is frustrated because she has consistently been experiencing severe, sharp vaginal pain on penetration. She has tried lubricants without significant relief. She has not been able to use tampons in the past due to similar pain with tampon insertion. External vulvar examination shows no abnormalities. She is unable to undergo a bimanual or speculum examination due to tightening of the pelvic floor muscles and pain with attempted digit or speculum insertion. Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is negative. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

He reports severe back and right hip pain. He has schizophrenia and a history of opioid use disorder, for which he is currently on daily methadone maintenance treatment. His pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. He appears to be in distress. Breath sounds are equal bilaterally. The abdomen is soft without guarding. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis shows burst fractures of the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies and a subtrochanteric fracture of the right hip. The patient is started on intravenous ketorolac. An hour later, the patient rates the pain as 9/10 on a numeric scale and requests additional pain medication. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient's pain?",

When a patient has OUD or is on MMT and is experiencing severe acute pain that does not respond to non-opioid analgesics, the physician can consider regional anesthesia (e.g., neuraxial analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks) or dissociative anesthetics (e.g., ketamine). For situations in which these strategies cannot be used (e.g., contraindication to ketamine due to schizophrenia), the physician should prescribe a short-acting full opioid agonist with p.r.n. doses along with a nonopioid analgesic that is administered regularly at fixed doses. Methadone should not be discontinued when the opioid analgesic is initiated.",

While nonpharmacological treatment approaches include physical therapy, exercise, and patient education (e.g., maintaining a healthy weight), NSAIDs are recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment for pain relief. The preferred initial therapy for individuals with knee osteoarthritis is a topical NSAID, such as diclofenac, due to the lack of systemic absorption. Second-line treatment consists of acetaminophen or intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. Pharmacotherapy should only be used as a short-term treatment in symptomatic patients; long-term therapy is associated with many adverse effects (e.g., renal function impairment, gastric and duodenal ulcers). Surgery is typically indicated if conservative measures fail.",

The knee pain is worse when she walks for longer than 30 minutes. When she wakes up in the morning, her fingers and knees are stiff for about 15 minutes. She cannot recall any trauma to the joints. She was treated with amoxicillin following a tick bite 2 years ago. She is otherwise healthy and only takes a multivitamin and occasionally acetaminophen for the pain. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 133/78 mm Hg. Examination of the lower extremities shows mild genu varum. Range of motion of both knees is limited; there is palpable crepitus. Complete flexion and extension elicit pain. Tender nodules are present on the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index, ring, and little fingers bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Lyme arthritis usually causes effusion and mild pain in a single joint, most often the knee, but can affect multiple joints as well and can persist for several years. Although this patient sustained a past tick bite, which could have infected her with Borrelia burgdorferi, she was already treated with amoxicillin, the first-line therapy for Lyme disease. Additionally, she shows no extraarticular signs of the condition. Lastly, Lyme arthritis does not cause crepitus, genu varum, and interphalangeal nodes.",

Moreover, the characteristic hand deformities from long-standing RA are swan-neck deformity and Boutonniere deformity as opposed to the interphalangeal joint nodes seen in this patient.",

The patient has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years. She drinks 5–6 alcoholic beverages daily. Current medications include glyburide, lisinopril, and oral vitamin D supplements. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 138/86 mm Hg. Examination shows severe epigastric tenderness to palpation with guarding but no rebound; bowel sounds are normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows diffuse enlargement of the pancreas; no gallstones are visualized. The patient is admitted to the hospital and intravenous fluids and ketorolac are started. An hour later, the patient is still vomiting intermittently and rates the pain as a 9 on a 10-point scale. Physical examination of the abdomen shows no changes from the previous examination findings.

With PCAs, patients press a button that releases additional intravenous medication, allowing them to control the amount of analgesic they receive and minimizing the risk of underdosing. The pumps include a lockout period during which no further analgesic can be administered in order to avoid inappropriately high doses and reduce the risk of respiratory depression. Although opioids are known to cause sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, there is no evidence showing that opioids aggravate pancreatitis or worsen clinical outcomes.",

Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), though often elevated in AS, may be normal even in active disease. However, the symptoms of AS characteristically improve with NSAIDs, examination would show some limitations in spine mobility, and imaging would show spinal abnormalities, such as loss of lumbar lordosis, vertebral body erosion, and sclerosis even in early stages of the disease.",

However, examination would also show muscle weakness, and, in most cases, inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) and muscle enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase) would be elevated.

            "title": "Mechanism of action: gout drugs",
            "description": "Acute gout attack: Increases in uric acid concentration or decreases in temperature/pH can lead to the accumulation of urate crystals in various tissues, triggering inflammation. First-line treatment options include NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and colchicine.Purine metabolism: Uric acid concentration can increase due to underexcretion (e.g., in chronic renal insufficiency) or over-production (e.g., in tumor lysis syndrome or high dietary purine intake). Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol) inhibit the purine degradation pathway from hypoxanthine to uric acid. Uricosuric medications (e.g., probenecid) inhibit uric acid reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules, thus increasing renal excretion. Pegloticase (a recombinant uricase) catalyzes the breakdown of uric acid into allantoin, which is more water-soluble and, therefore, more readily excreted renally.",

        "description": "Sample of synovial fluid under polarizing light microscopyMonosodium urate crystals are needle-shaped and appear yellow when their optical axis is oriented parallel to the polarizer. If their axis is perpendicular to the polarizer, they appear blue. The underlying physical principle is called negative birefringence.Detection of negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals in synovial fluid confirms the diagnosis of gout.",

The S1 nerve root controls plantar flexion through the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, so weakness in these muscles can lead to a diminished Achilles tendon reflex and impaired toe walking. Additionally, the S1 nerve root controls sensation in the dorsolateral aspect of the thigh, the posterior calf, and the lateral side of the foot, which explains this patient's radiating pain in these regions.",

Other features that may be present in patients with fibromyalgia include paresthesias, headache, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction (“fibro fog”), and autonomic dysfunction. CBC and ESR are typically normal in patients with this condition. Fibromyalgia is associated with comorbidities such as tension headaches, sleep disturbances, anxiety disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and irritable bowel syndrome. First-line therapies for fibromyalgia include nonpharmacologic interventions such as patient education, dietary changes, sleep hygiene, and regular physical activity.",

Pain contracts may be indicated for patients undergoing narcotic therapy, especially for chronic pain. It is not clear from this patient's presentation whether he requires pain management with opioids. His behavior and presentation raise concern for substance use disorder, and prescribing a long-acting opioid may increase the risk of drug misuse.

It is the physician's responsibility to guard against misuse of prescription drugs while properly assessing and treating the patient's pain. To do so, they must avoid prejudice and cognitive bias. It is therefore appropriate in this case to request further information regarding the patient's drug use, to determine whether he has a history of substance use disorder and/or aberrant drug-related behaviors (e.g., actively receiving narcotic prescriptions from multiple physicians).\n\nOnline federal resources may be of use to determine if a patient has a history of opioid use disorder, or if the patient is actively receiving narcotic prescriptions from multiple physicians.",

Prostate cancer is frequently associated with skeletal metastases, with the spine being the most common location. Accordingly, some patients present with lower back pain as the initial manifestation. Red flags for metastatic bone disease include a history of cancer, advanced age, unexplained weight loss, and bone pain that does not improve after one month. Besides pain, which commonly occurs at night and exacerbates with movement, patients with metastatic bone disease from prostate cancer can present with pathologic fractures, hypocalcemia (due to osteoblastic metastasis), and neurological deficits (due to spinal cord compression).",

LSS typically causes bilateral radiating pain to the buttocks and/or legs that is exacerbated by activities involving lumbar extension (e.g., standing, walking downhill) and relieved by lumbar flexion (e.g., sitting or lying down when sleeping). Furthermore, he does not have typical symptoms of LSS, such as cramping, numbness, weakness, or tingling in the legs. While LSS can rarely lead to urinary retention symptoms secondary to cauda equina syndrome, this patient's normal sensorimotor function makes such a diagnosis unlikely.",

            "description": "Pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is typically dependent on postural changes. Symptoms typically improve when sitting or leaning forward (shopping-cart sign), as lumbar flexion widens the central spinal canal and relieves nerve root compression. In contrast, symptoms typically worsen with positions involving lumbar extension (e.g., walking, prolonged standing). This phenomenon is referred to as neuropathic claudication and is a hallmark of LSS.",

Three weeks ago, he had an acute arterial embolism that could not be revascularized in time to save the leg. He now reports episodic hot, shooting, and tingling pain in the right lower leg that began shortly after the amputation. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. His current medications are metformin and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a slightly erythematous stump with clean sutures. The skin overlying the stump is warm and well-perfused. Muscle strength and sensation are normal throughout the remaining extremity and the left lower extremity. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This condition typically develops within days to weeks after surgery, as seen in this patient. Other postoperative complications (e.g., infection, ischemia) must be ruled out to make a diagnosis of phantom limb pain. Treatment options include mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, NMDA receptor antagonists, and other adjuvant therapies (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants).",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "The shallow but rapid breathing, insomnia, and features of sympathetic activation (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension) are most likely due to pain. For terminally ill patients, pain relief is prioritized over the potential adverse effects of pain medication (i.e., the principle of double effect).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This patient's severe, persistent pain indicates that he is currently not receiving an adequate dosage of morphine. Under close monitoring, a titrated increase in opioid dosage (typically by 25–50% every 24 hours until the desired pain relief is achieved) minimizes the risks of severe side effects (e.g., respiratory depression). For individuals on patient-controlled analgesia, this dosage titration can be achieved by decreasing the duration of the lockout period, increasing the single bolus limit, and/or increasing the daily dose limit of the opioid. In addition, a continuous low-dose infusion of opioids or nonopioid analgesics can be used as an adjuvant for pain relief.",

        "explanation_why": "Sleep medications (e.g., zolpidem) are a short-term treatment for primary insomnia. In patients with secondary insomnia (e.g., due to pain, as seen here), an attempt should be made to treat the underlying cause before considering sleep medications. Nonopioid analgesics (NOAs) are not as effective as opioids in providing pain relief (they are on a lower rung of the WHO analgesic ladder). In patients who are already receiving opioids without adequate pain relief, certain NOAs (e.g., ketorolac) can be used as adjuncts but not as a replacement.",

        "explanation_why": "Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems, which allow patients to titrate medication based on their level of pain, have a lockout period to prevent the delivery of an inappropriately high dose of analgesic if patients try to administer medication too frequently. Therefore, an intentional morphine overdose is unlikely, and removing PCA would not be effective in the management of this patient's pain.",

This patient's shallow but rapid breathing is most likely due to pain rather than opioid-induced respiratory depression, which causes bradypnea.

The pain started in the shoulder muscles and then spread to the arms, back, and legs. She often feels stiff in the morning but does not have significant joint pain. She reports that she has had trouble sleeping because of the pain and cannot concentrate during the day. Medical history is remarkable for major depressive disorder. Her only medication is sertraline. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She appears tired. Examination shows tenderness in the arms and legs and along the axial skeleton. There is no joint swelling. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 13.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10 mm/h, and a creatine kinase concentration of 55 U/L. Results of other laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In addition, initial management of FM should include patient education (including reassurance about the disease and its prognosis and the importance of nonpharmacological measures such as sleep hygiene), treatment of comorbidities (e.g., mood and sleep disorders), and pharmacotherapy with low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline). Cyclobenzaprine, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine), or anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin) can also be used as initial pharmacotherapy.",

    "question_text": "A 78-year-old man receiving home hospice care for advanced metastatic prostate cancer is examined at home at the request of his wife. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 months ago, and the cancer has metastasized to his lower spine, pelvis, right femur, liver, and lungs despite hormonal ablation therapy. The patient declines chemotherapy. His wife reports difficulty managing her husband's pain and that he is restless. He has avoided solid food for the past 2 weeks and has lost weight. He often coughs after drinking water. Current medications include oxycodone as needed, extended-release morphine, and lactulose. The patient appears to be in moderate distress. Temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 121/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There is severe tenderness to palpation of the lower back, and the patient is unable to sit up on his own due to pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The patient declines chemotherapy. His wife reports difficulty managing her husband's pain and that he is restless. He has avoided solid food for the past 2 weeks and has lost weight. He often coughs after drinking water. Current medications include oxycodone as needed, extended-release morphine, and lactulose. The patient appears to be in moderate distress. Temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 121/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There is severe tenderness to palpation of the lower back, and the patient is unable to sit up on his own due to pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

External beam radiation therapy and intravenous injection of bone-targeted radioisotopes are the radiotherapy modalities used to manage pain caused by bone metastases.",

Accordingly, his oral medications should be reduced as much as possible, and a non-oral form of analgesia is the most appropriate next step in management. Fentanyl is a synthetic full opioid agonist with a higher potency than morphine. The transdermal formulation of fentanyl is indicated in the treatment of chronic cancer-related pain, providing steady analgesia because it diffuses continuously into the blood.",

        "explanation_why": "Codeine is an oral medication used in the management of mild to moderate pain and is a potent cough suppressant. Although this patient has insufficient pain control and a cough, the symptom of coughing while swallowing indicates oropharyngeal dysphagia and a high risk of aspiration. Therefore, a medication that can be administered via a non-oral route should be considered. In addition, codeine is less effective in patients with liver disease (like this patient with liver metastasis) because it is a prodrug that relies on hepatic metabolism to achieve its analgesic effect.",

She is in the military reserve and was involved in active combat 2 weeks ago, during which she sustained multiple gunshot wounds to her left lower leg resulting in irreversible limb ischemia. She is currently taking oral acetaminophen, which has provided minimal pain relief. The patient has a history of bronchial asthma for which she uses an albuterol inhaler. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 123/75 mm Hg. Physical examination of the residual limb shows mild erythema and drainage of a scant amount of serous fluid from the sutured wound. Muscle strength in the hip and upper leg is normal bilaterally. Sensation to pain and temperature is normal in the left upper leg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Other forms of first-line treatment for phantom limb pain include mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and pharmacotherapy with NMDA receptor antagonists.

Alcohol inhibits antidiuretic hormone secretion and reduces water absorption in the kidneys, which leads to dehydration and increased risk of erythrocyte sickling. Oral rehydration or IV fluids are appropriate for euvolemic patients. In general, IV fluids should be used judiciously because overhydration can trigger or exacerbate acute chest syndrome. Because hypoxia can worsen erythrocyte sickling, patients with SpO2 of < 95% should be given supplemental oxygen. In addition, pain should be managed with opioids in most patients.",

Three years ago, she was diagnosed with shingles and subsequently developed postherpetic neuralgia. She was treated with capsaicin cream, pregabalin, and lamotrigine. She says that none of the medications provided sufficient pain relief until she started taking hydrocodone 1 year ago. Additional medical history is remarkable for major depressive disorder, for which she takes sertraline. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 74/min, and blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urine immunoassay screening is negative for opioids but positive for benzodiazepines. Upon discussing the results with the patient, she claims that she has not taken any benzodiazepines. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

However, a negative result for opioids on UIA alone is insufficient evidence of drug diversion, and conclusions about a substance use disorder cannot be made from UIA alone.",

        "explanation_why": "Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids can lead to severe CNS and respiratory depression and should generally be avoided. UIA has several limitations, as false positive results for benzodiazepines can occur due to the intake of a drug with a similar structure, such as sertraline.

Therefore, unexpected results should be discussed with the patient to find possible explanations before drawing presumptive conclusions about treatment nonadherence, recreational substance use, or drug diversion and before making any therapeutic decisions. Results may also be discussed with laboratory personnel who can aid with interpretation. If no explanation is found, confirmatory testing with urine chromatography is necessary to reliably detect and quantify concentrations of specific drugs and their metabolites.",

        "explanation_why": "Thalamic pain syndrome (central poststroke pain; Dejerine-Roussy syndrome) commonly follows posterior cerebral artery stroke, which typically involves the thalamogeniculate arteries or the posterior choroidal arteries and leads to damage in the ventral posterolateral nucleus. Characteristic symptoms are initial paresthesia followed by neuropathic pain, allodynia, and dysesthesia. These symptoms typically occur on the contralateral side if the trunk and extremities are affected and in the hemifacial region ipsilateral to the stroke. Management of thalamic pain syndrome involves a multidisciplinary approach that integrates pharmacological, physical, and psychological interventions, along with comorbidity management and patient education. Invasive treatment (e.g., deep brain stimulation) may be considered if the pain is refractory to conservative management.",

He has gained 7 kg (15 lb 7 oz) recently and has become more sedentary, which has worsened his neuropathic pain and depression. His score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is 5, indicating mild depression. He used to run regularly but stopped 10 years ago after moving to a new home. He briefly started swimming 5 years ago but has only returned to the pool once in the past two months to join his wife for an aquatic therapy class. Although his wife attends twice a week, he hasn't felt motivated to join her consistently. The physician feels that lifestyle changes may help alleviate both pain and depression, and engages the patient in a conversation integrating features of motivational interviewing. The patient recognizes a need for lifestyle changes and writes down several goals to work towards before his next appointment. Which of the following is the most appropriate goal to establish with this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "Asking the patient to join his wife for aquatic therapy class at least once per week for the next 4 weeks fulfills all the requirements of a SMART goal. It identifies a specific action to perform, it can be measured, it is achievable and relevant for this patient (especially since he has done this class before and has enjoyed being in the pool when he was swimming), and it pinpoints a time frame. SMART goals help the patient be more realistic about the expected benefits of therapy and link treatment outcomes to functional improvements. These personalized goals also help the clinician understand the patient and learn what is most important to them. The action should preferably be framed positively (e.g., \"I will do...\") rather than negatively (e.g., \"I will not...\") and should focus on a process within the patient's control (e.g., \"attending aquatic therapy class once a week\") rather than an outcome that may not be entirely controllable (e.g., \"losing 10 pounds\"). The goal should be challenging yet achievable to avoid diminishing the patient's self-efficacy through repeated failure.\n\nFor patients with chronic pain, SMART goals help connect treatment decisions to specific benefits, set realistic expectations for analgesic therapy, and facilitate discussions on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain management options. An important aspect of setting a SMART goal is following up with the patient within a specified time frame to assess whether they are achieving the goal, to identify potential barriers to achievement, and to reassess the goal.",
