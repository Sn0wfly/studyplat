        "explanation_why": "With advancing age, the ability of the body to mount antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to a new antigen decreases. This is caused by a decline in the counts of most subsets of B cells and T cells. The decreased immune response is also caused by impaired affinity maturation and V(D)J recombination, an increase in the proportion of monoclonal cell lines, and decreased affinity of antibodies for new antigens due to a decrease in the variety of B-cell receptors for antigens. These changes lead to an increased need for booster vaccinations in older adults.",

        "explanation_why": "Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia is the underlying mechanism of reflex incontinence, which is characterized by unpredictable urinary leakage that occurs when the bladder is full or otherwise stimulated (e.g., by cold air). This occurs due to simultaneous dyssynergistic contractions of the sphincter and the detrusor muscle, brought about by an underlying neurologic condition like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. This patient has no such condition and exhibits urinary expulsion that is preceded by physical stress.",

        "explanation_why": "Urethral hypermobility is one of the most common causes of stress incontinence and is caused by impaired support from the pelvic floor. At times of increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., laughing, coughing, sneezing), the proximal urethra and the bladder neck descend out of the pelvis and transit more pressure to the bladder. During this process, intraurethral pressure falls below bladder pressure, resulting in urine leakage. This patients age, previous childbirths, and postmenopausal estrogen loss are likely contributing factors to the development of a weakened pelvic floor and thus urethral hypermobility.",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Atypical pneumonia (dry cough, bilateral interstitial infiltrates), watery diarrhea, and hyponatremia suggest Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by Legionella pneumophila. Infection with this organism is commonly acquired via inhalation of aerosols from contaminated water, typically from air-conditioning systems, showers, and swimming pools (e.g., in hotels or on cruise ships), which can result in disease outbreaks.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Although direct immunofluorescence of respiratory secretions is very specific (up to 99%), its use in detecting Legionella has fallen out of favor because of the high level of expertise required to perform it correctly. Moreover, its sensitivity is much lower than other diagnostic steps because a positive direct fluorescent antibody test requires the presence of a large number of Legionella.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "In patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require hospital admission, a Gram stain of good-quality (expectorated) sputum samples is often performed before initiating antibiotic therapy. However, in this patient with a dry cough, it would be difficult to obtain such a sample. In addition, the most likely cause of this patient's pneumonia is Legionella pneumophila, a facultative intracellular organism that does not stain well with the Gram stain; the sensitivity of a Gram stain for detecting this pathogen is low.",

        "explanation_why": "Although a chest CT may be considered for legionellosis if fever persists despite treatment with an appropriate antibiotic to help differentiate from other forms of atypical pneumonia (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumonia), it is not indicated at this time. If lung carcinoma were suspected, a chest CT would be indicated as an initial test. However, the acute onset of symptoms, the presence of diarrhea and fever, and the findings on chest x-ray are not suggestive of lung carcinoma despite the patient's age and his history of smoking.",

        "explanation_why": "Urine antigen assay detects Legionella-soluble antigens that are present in the bacterial cell wall and excreted in urine. As this test has relatively high sensitivity (> 70%) and very high specificity (100%), it is the best initial test for diagnosing legionellosis. It is important to note, however, that this test only detects the serogroup that most commonly causes legionellosis, serogroup 1. If legionellosis is still suspected even though the urinary antigen test is negative, a culture of respiratory secretions or a polymerase chain reaction test can be performed in order to detect other serogroups of the bacteria. Fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin) are the treatment of choice for Legionnaires' disease.",

His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 113/min, respirations are 35/min, and blood pressure is 78/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 77%. Auscultation shows diffuse crackles over the right lung field. Cardiac examination shows an S_4 gallop. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. He is intubated, mechanically ventilated, and moved to the intensive care unit. An x-ray of the chest shows right upper and middle lobe infiltrates and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. A norepinephrine infusion is begun and the patient is administered intravenous antibiotics. Which of the following would most likely be found on Gram stain examination of this patient's sputum?",

She has nausea, pain in her right hip, and has not been able to walk since the fall. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis. She lives with her daughter. She is independent in all of her activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. She walks 2 miles every other day. She smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 10 years ago. Current medications include atorvastatin, ramipril, metformin, and a multivitamin. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 19 kg/m^2. She appears pale. Vital signs are within normal limits. The right leg seems shorter than the left and is rotated externally. Pulses are intact in both lower extremities. Palpation of the right hip causes severe pain and the range of motion is limited. An x-ray of the right hip is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

A lag screw is then placed through the nail, which enters the neck and head of the femur. This nail also allows for compression (weight-bearing) of the fracture site. The combination of intramedullary nail and lag screw resembles the Greek letter \"γ\" (gamma), which is why it is called a gamma locking nail.",

Since his surgery, he has not had a bowel movement and is unable to pass flatus. He has no nausea or vomiting. Prior to the operation, the patient had daily bowel movements without abnormalities. He has a history of bipolar disorder and hypertension. His current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, chlorpromazine, amlodipine, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows a distended, tympanic abdomen with guarding and rebound tenderness; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Abdominal x-ray shows diffuse distention of the colon loops. A CT scan with contrast confirms the x-ray findings and shows a cecal dilation of 14 cm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management?",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Abdominal distention and marked dilation of the colon and cecum on imaging indicate acute megacolon. This condition typically occurs as a complication of an interventional procedure and/or a side effect of medications that are known to decrease intestinal motility (e.g., amlodipine, chlorpromazine). The combination of fever, tachycardia, abdominal rebound tenderness, and guarding suggests a case complicated by peritonitis and actual or impending bowel ischemia.",

            "description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the entire motor neuron system (degeneration of the upper motor neuron in the precentral gyrus and lower motor neuron in the brainstem or anterior horn of the spinal cord). The disease most commonly manifests between 50 and 70 years of age, often beginning with unilateral weakness in the hands or feet, which then progresses to the contralateral side (asymmetric limb weakness). However, initial manifestations are highly variable and individuals may have atypical or nonspecific symptoms such as subtle vocal changes. As the disease progresses, most individuals eventually develop one or both of the life-threatening symptoms: respiratory impairment and dysphagia.",

She reports that she has become slower at completing sudoku puzzles. She has been living independently since the death of her husband 3 years ago. She goes shopping, cooks her own meals, and plays bridge with her friends every weekend. She is not anxious about her memory lapses. She has no trouble sleeping but has been getting up earlier than she used to. She has hypertension that is managed with hydrochlorothiazide. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows a normal gait. She describes her mood as “good” and her speech is normal. Her thought process is organized and her judgment is intact. She makes one error when performing serial sevens. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

An important distinguishing factor between normal aging and forms of dementia is the degree to which independence with everyday activities is impaired. In normal aging, independence in daily activities is preserved. Because this patient lives independently and her cognitive exams are within normal limits, dementia is unlikely.",

    "question_text": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease 5 years ago. The daughter reports that in the past year, her mother has become nonambulatory, can speak only a few intelligible words, and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite and progressive dysphagia, resulting in a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She has been hospitalized three times for aspiration pneumonia, and her diet now consists only of puréed food. She has no advance directives. The daughter says that she does not want her mother to return to the hospital again, but she is concerned about her ability to continue providing care alone. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but well groomed. The patient is oriented only to self. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 0/30, and Functional Assessment Staging Tool scale is 7/7. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B_12 are within the reference ranges. Her serum albumin concentration is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Autonomic dysfunction is a common underlying cause of orthostatic syncope. In patients with orthostatic syncope, standing causes a drop in venous return to the heart, leading to decreased preload and decreased cardiac output. Normally, sympathetic tone increases and parasympathetic tone decreases, which together lead to vasoconstriction, increased venous return to the heart, and increased heart rate, all of which work to prevent significant decreases in hypotension. If the normal autonomic response to standing is compromised (e.g., medications, neuropathy), then orthostatic hypotension occurs. This patient's orthostasis is likely potentiated by her age (advanced age is a risk factor for baroreceptor dysfunction), calcium channel blocker use (which blunts peripheral vasoconstriction), and tricyclic antidepressant use (causing autonomic dysfunction).\n\nGiven this patient's clear orthostatic changes, highly suggestive history, and otherwise normal workup, no further diagnostic testing is required. Adjustment in medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and/or calcium channel blockers is likely the next best step to reduce this patient's risk of recurrent syncope.",

In addition, diagnosis requires two of the following: cognitive fluctuations (episodes of worse cognition and alertness interspersed with periods of relatively normal function), visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. While this patient demonstrates cognitive impairment and a slow gait with short steps, she does not have any other features of parkinsonism, e.g., tremor or rigidity. Also, the patient lacks visual hallucinations or cognitive fluctuations.",

FTD typically presents on average during the fifth decade of life, making it a relatively common cause of early-onset dementia. While this patient's performance on the five-minute recall test generally raises suspicion for the presence of dementia, the lack of language dysfunction or personality changes, the patient's age, and the presence of gait abnormalities make FTD an unlikely diagnosis.",

Although cerebral atrophy is often bilateral in frontotemporal dementia, it can be asymmetrical, as demonstrated in this example.Because the majority of people develop some degree of brain atrophy as a part of normal aging, correlation with the clinical history is essential for this condition.",

He reports that it is becoming gradually more difficult to care for her. She occasionally has tantrums and there are times when she does not recognize him. She sleeps 6–8 hours throughout the day and is increasingly agitated and confused at night. When the phone, television, or oven beeps she thinks she is at the dentist's office and becomes very anxious. She eats 2–3 meals a day and has a good appetite. She has not fallen. She has not left the home in weeks except for short walks. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She takes levothyroxine, aspirin, warfarin, donepezil, verapamil, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin daily.  Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. It is important to the family that the patient continues her care at home. Which of the following recommendations is most appropriate at this time?",

This patient's anxiety is likely a consequence of her dysregulated sleep (i.e., nighttime insomnia and daytime hypersomnia) and resulting disorientation.

His wife reports that over the past 7 months he has gradually become more forgetful. He commonly misplaces his car keys and forgets his children's names. He seems to have forgotten how to make dinner and sometimes serves uncooked noodles or raw meat. One night he parked his car in a neighbor's bushes and was found wandering the street. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD. Current medications include atorvastatin, metoprolol, ipratropium, and fluticasone. Vital signs are within normal limits. He is alert and oriented to person and place only. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 19/30. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, liver function tests, vitamin B_12 (cobalamin), and folate are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

    "hint": "This patient has several signs of dementia including forgetfulness, impaired judgment, and disorientation. The diagnosis is supported by his Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (13–20 points: moderate dementia). His clinical and laboratory workup for reversible causes of dementia (e.g., vitamin B_12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, etc.) have been unremarkable.",

While this patient exhibits several hallmarks of dementia, his course of development has been relatively slow and subtle. Moreover, his unremarkable vital signs (without evidence of fever or tachycardia), physical examination without neck stiffness or focal neurological deficits, and laboratory findings (without an elevated white blood cell count) decrease suspicion for encephalitis and meningitis as acute causes of dementia for which lumbar puncture would be diagnostically useful.",

Because this patient's clinical history and examination results strongly suggest a diagnosis of dementia, neuropsychologic testing is unlikely to provide additional diagnostic information.",

A positive genotype test may increase clinical suspicion for AD and help to stratify risk for progression. However, false positives and negatives do occur, and ApoE genotyping is not routinely used in clinical settings. Moreover, while this 72-year-old patient's relatively slow neurocognitive decline and his MMSE score may be consistent with a diagnosis of AD, there are other potential causes of dementia that are also consistent with his clinical course, and a broader diagnostic approach is more appropriate to address this differential.",

However, there are numerous other possible etiologies of his neurocognitive decline (e.g., CNS tumor, cerebrovascular disease) that could be detected with other diagnostic studies. PET scans are relatively expensive, provide very specific data, and are not without risk and, as such, would not be appropriate as a first-line imaging modality in this patient with a relatively broad remaining differential.",

Specific atrophy or lesion patterns may be associated with particular etiologies, e.g., multiple lacunar infarcts in vascular dementia (VD) or reduced hippocampal volume in Alzheimer disease (AD). In older adults with a slow, insidious onset of dementia and only cognitive deficits, such as this patient, AD and VD are among the most common causes of dementia, and MRI findings may help guide the next steps in management.",

His overnight nurse reported that she observed several periods of rest followed by sudden episodes of agitation without a clear trigger. He has hypertension and COPD. He previously smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years but quit 10 years ago. He drinks one glass of whiskey per day. His current medications include oxycodone, hydrochlorothiazide, and salmeterol. He appears agitated. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 141/84 mm Hg. Pulmonary examination shows a prolonged expiratory phase but no other abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. During the examination, the patient becomes violent, pulls out his intravenous line, and attempts to leave the room. He does not respond to verbal deescalation techniques, and soft restraints are used. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In patients with agitation, additional measures, such as deescalation techniques, are used. Coercive measures (e.g., physical restraints) may be necessary if the patient is actively violent. A calming medication should be used before or immediately after applying restraints to reduce the risk of injury and negative psychological consequences. An antipsychotic (e.g., haloperidol) is the calming medication of choice for refractory agitation in patients with delirium. After adequate sedation has been achieved, restraints should be removed immediately.",

    "question_text": "A 76-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of increasing muscle pain and stiffness, weakness of her shoulders and legs, and generalized fatigue. She has been having great difficulty getting out of bed in the morning. On two occasions, her son had to come over and help her stand up. She has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss and has not been sleeping well during this period. She has had multiple episodes of left-sided headaches and pain in the jaw while chewing over the past 2 months. She had a fall and hit her head on the staircase banister 3 months ago. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 128/88 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. Range of motion of the shoulder and hip is mildly limited by pain. Muscle strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, she admits her mood “is not that great.” Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 79 mm/h, and her serum creatine kinase concentration is 38 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's headaches?",

She has been having great difficulty getting out of bed in the morning. On two occasions, her son had to come over and help her stand up. She has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss and has not been sleeping well during this period. She has had multiple episodes of left-sided headaches and pain in the jaw while chewing over the past 2 months. She had a fall and hit her head on the staircase banister 3 months ago. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 128/88 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. Range of motion of the shoulder and hip is mildly limited by pain. Muscle strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, she admits her mood “is not that great.” Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 79 mm/h, and her serum creatine kinase concentration is 38 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's headaches?",

This patient's constitutional symptoms (fever, weakness, weight loss) with additional symptoms of PMR, unilateral headache and jaw pain (from inflammation of the temporal artery), and an increased ESR are all suggestive of this disease. PMR is highly associated with giant cell arteritis; ∼ 50% of patients with GCA have PMR, and ∼ 20% of patients with PMR have GCA. Prompt diagnosis (via temporal artery biopsy) and treatment are warranted to prevent serious complications, such as visual loss (from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) and cerebral ischemia.",

She has been mumbling to herself and wandering around the neighborhood. These symptoms are worse in the evenings and she has hardly slept at night. She has not been eating or drinking much for the past 6 days.  She has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. She was diagnosed with breast cancer 12 years ago and was treated with left-sided mastectomy. The patient is oriented to person but not to place or time. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a supple neck. Neurologic examination shows psychomotor agitation. Attention and concentration are impaired; she makes multiple errors while performing the serial sevens test. Her speech is disorganized. Her fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 122 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she got lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas oven on after cooking a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. Her speech rhythm is normal but is frequently interrupted as she thinks of words to frame her sentences. She makes multiple errors while performing serial sevens. Her clock drawing is impaired and she draws 14 numbers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Definitive treatment involves drainage of excess CSF via a cerebral shunt, usually into the peritoneum (ventriculoperitoneal shunt).",

Initially, he used to forget his grandchildren's names or forget to lock the house door. During the past year, he has gotten lost twice while returning from the grocery store and was unable to tell passersby his address. On one occasion, he went to the park with his granddaughter and returned home alone without realizing he had forgotten her. His daughter says that over the past year, he has withdrawn himself from social gatherings and avoids making conversation. He does not sleep well at night. His daughter has hired a helper to cook and clean his home. On mental status examination, he is oriented only to person. He describes his mood as fair. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. He appears indifferent about his memory lapses and says this is normal for someone of his age. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient is a drug that acts on which of the following neurotransmitters?",

Once the ventricles enlarge, homeostasis between CSF production and resorption is established and intracranial pressure normalizes.\n\nCSF shunting is the main treatment for NPH. The next step in the management of this patient should be to perform a lumbar tap test.

        "explanation_why": "The combination of severe hypertension (systolic ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic ≥ 120 mm Hg) and signs of acute end-organ damage are highly concerning for a hypertensive emergency. This patient presents with significantly elevated blood pressure and signs of both severe hypertensive retinopathy (formerly referred to as “malignant hypertension”) and hypertensive encephalopathy (headache, nausea, vomiting). A hypertensive emergency requires immediate treatment to prevent further end-organ damage. Generally, blood pressure must be lowered slowly, as vessels will have adjusted to hypertension and rapid drops in blood pressure (even if it remains within normal limits) can induce ischemia. A common approach is mean arterial pressure reduction by 10–20% in the first hour and another 5–15% over the following 23 hours.",

However, the visual loss in GCA is usually due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which presents with a pale, swollen disc, often unilaterally, rather than bilateral papilledema. GCA is also typically associated with jaw claudication and scalp tenderness.",

Her son reports that she has had increased difficulty finding her way back home for the last several months, despite having lived in the same city for 40 years. He also reports that his mother has been unable to recall the names of her relatives and been increasingly forgetting important family gatherings such as her grandchildren's birthdays over the last few years. The patient has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her current medications include enalapril and metformin. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls 2 out of 3 words immediately and 1 out of 3 after 5 minutes. Her gait and muscle strength are normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

By leaning forward, the spinal canal is widened and spinal cord compression is reduced. Therefore, leaning forward will most likely relieve this patient's back pain. Activities that flex the lumbar spine, such as sitting, cycling, or walking uphill, also help widen the spinal canal and alleviate pain in patients with spinal stenosis.\n\nThe exacerbation of lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms by certain postures that narrow the spinal cord (walking downhill, standing, walking) is called pseudoclaudication. In contrast to vascular claudication, which is a result of arterial vessel narrowing and impaired metabolic demands of muscle tissue, pseudoclaudication is thought to result from increased metabolic demands of a compressed and ischemic spinal cord.",

His daughter says that over the past several months he has been more aggressive towards friends and family. She also reports several episodes in which he claimed to see two strangers in her apartment. He sometimes stares blankly for several minutes and does not react when addressed. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and was diagnosed with Parkinson disease 2 months ago. His current medications include carbidopa-levodopa, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. He is oriented to person but not to place and time. There is a resting tremor in his right upper extremity. There is muscle rigidity in the upper and lower extremities. He is able to walk without assistance but has a slow gait with short steps. Mental status examination shows short-term memory deficits. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",

Parkinsonism and dementia are typical features of both conditions and the onset of neuropsychiatric features in relation to motor symptoms can help differentiate between the two. In DLB, dementia, visual hallucinations, and paranoid episodes typically occur before or concurrent to the onset of parkinsonism, whereas in Parkinson disease, dementia occurs in advanced disease (usually several years after the onset of motor symptoms). DLB causes abnormal sleep and episodic cognitive fluctuations and responds poorly to levodopa.",

Sometimes she sees a dog in her kitchen and at other times she sees a stranger in her garden, both of which no one else can see. She also reports a lack of motivation to do daily tasks for the past week. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and was started on levodopa and carbidopa. Her younger brother has schizophrenia. The patient also takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She used to drink a bottle of wine every day, but she stopped drinking alcohol 2 months ago. Neurologic examination shows a mild resting tremor of the hands and bradykinesia. Her thought process is organized and logical. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "content": "Adverse effect of medication",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Levodopa (L-DOPA), a dopamine precursor, is the most effective medication for controlling the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease. Primary effects of L-DOPA are achieved by stimulating D2-receptors in the substantia nigra and striatum. However, overstimulation of D2-receptors by levodopa may also induce psychosis and hallucinations (usually visual). The risk for developing psychiatric symptoms increases with age, other psychiatric conditions, long duration of levodopa treatment, and high doses. Since this patient has been taking levodopa for 3 years and is elderly, her symptoms are most likely the result of levodopa therapy.\n\nOther adverse effects of L-DOPA therapy include dizziness, somnolence or insomnia, anxiety, and aggressive behavior.",

            "description": "Dopamine agonists (e.g., ropinirole, bromocriptine) bind to the dopamine receptor, mimicking the action of dopamine.DOPA-Decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitors (e.g., carbidopa) decrease the peripheral conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine, which results in reduced peripheral side-effects of L-DOPA. These drugs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore do not reduce dopamine production in the brain nor do they have central side-effects.Dopamine precursors (e.g., L-DOPA) are converted by DOPA decarboxylase at the presynaptic neuron resulting in direct dopaminergic effects (especially in D2 receptors).COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone, tolcapone) inhibits central (tolcapone) or peripheral (entacapone) catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) resulting in the reduced metabolization of dopamine, increase in dopamine effects, a decreased demand for L-DOPA, and a longer therapeutic effect with each dose.MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline) reduce the metabolism of central dopamine by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase B enzyme, which normally breaks down dopamine (and catecholamines) in the brain. This results in a prolonged dopamine effect and reduced demand for L-DOPA.Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., benztropine) inhibit excitatory cholinergic neurons, resulting in a proportionately lower concentration of acetylcholine compared to dopamine.NMDA antagonists (e.g., amantadine) act as antagonists at the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which results in a dopaminergic effect.",

Common clinical manifestations are mild (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, insomnia) but more severe findings (e.g., seizure, hallucinations, impaired consciousness) may also develop. Although this patient's visual hallucinations are similar to those seen in alcoholic hallucinosis and alcohol withdrawal delirium, she has not consumed alcohol for 2 months; alcohol withdrawal cannot be the cause of her symptoms.",

Although this patient has an increased risk (∼ 12%) of developing schizophrenia because her brother is affected, she lacks other expected symptoms (e.g., disorganized thought process, alogia).

She has also become withdrawn and refuses to go to social gatherings. She occasionally becomes confused in the evenings. Her blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg when supine and 124/80 mm Hg while standing. Examination shows a broad-based gait and difficulty maintaining balance while standing upright and walking. Neurologic examination shows bradykinesia, dysarthria, and palmar grasp reflex bilaterally. Muscle tone is increased in the upper extremities. Visual acuity test shows no abnormalities. There is conjugate limitation of both eyes when looking down. Mental status examination shows apathy. The patient responds to questions with 1–2 words after a delay of several seconds. MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Apathy, frontal lobe release signs (e.g., positive grasp reflex), and signs of dementia (sundowning, social withdrawal, forgetfulness) are typically not seen in MSA because the frontal lobe and other regions of the cortex are usually spared. In addition, MSA typically manifests with features of autonomic dysfunction such as urinary incontinence and orthostatic hypotension. MRI of the brain can show atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem, and the hot cross bun sign, which is a common but unspecific finding in patients with MSA.",

PSP is characterized by oculomotor deficits such as vertical gaze palsy (due to atrophy of structures in the tectum of the midbrain), which can progress to complete supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Patients with PSP often have postural instability, which leads to gait impairment and frequent falls. Frontal lobe dysfunction can manifest with behavioral changes (e.g., apathy, disinhibition, impaired reasoning) and dementia (forgetfulness, social withdrawal, sundowning). Patients usually also present with parkinsonism (e.g., bradykinesia, rigor) and may develop features of pseudobulbar palsy such as dysarthria and dysphagia. The prognosis of PSP is generally poor and most patients die within 5–10 years of symptom onset.\n\nSee “Overview of Parkinson-plus syndromes” table.",

    "question_text": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of involuntary, rhythmic movements of her hands for the past 5 months. The symptoms initially affected her left hand only, but now both hands are affected. She also reports that her symptoms are worse at rest and that performing tasks such as tying her shoelaces and writing have become more difficult. Her husband reports that she has been more withdrawn lately. She drank half a bottle of sherry every day for 18 years but has not consumed alcohol in the past year. She has chronic liver disease, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. Current medications include aspirin and propranolol. She appears anxious. She is oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 144/82 mm Hg. Examination shows a rhythmic, low-frequency tremor that is more prominent in the left hand. Range of motion in the arms and legs is normal. There is increased resistance to passive flexion and extension in the left upper limb. Muscle strength is 4/5 in all extremities. Sensations to pinprick and light touch are preserved. Finger-nose testing shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's clinical findings?",

Although this patient appears anxious, there is no history of a recent stressful event or a change in environment to suggest a functional neurological symptom disorder. Moreover, unlike the tremor in this patient, which has gradually worsened over the past 5 months and is present at rest, psychogenic tremors are episodic with an abrupt onset most often (∼ 80%) in the right hand. Psychogenic tremors are furthermore characterized by sudden variations in amplitude and/or frequency of the tremor and a decrease in tremor when the patient is distracted.",

However, hypertonicity associated with infarction of the red nucleus affects extensor muscles more than flexor muscles, which results in a decerebrate posture (unlike this patient who has a normal range of motion and increased resistance to both flexion and extension). Moreover, patients with Benedikt syndrome would have ataxia contralaterally (unlike this patient who has a normal finger-nose test) and features of oculomotor nerve palsy (e.g., ptosis, exotropia) ipsilaterally.",

The onset of symptoms over a period of 5 months as well as the absence of other features of decompensated liver failure (e.g., jaundice, ascites) suggest a different cause.",

The patient had been living independently but came to live with his daughter temporarily after he told her that he was unable to perform some of his daily activities. He has left the front door wide open and tap water running on multiple occasions. The patient is concerned about his memory lapses. He wakes up 6–7 times during the night. He often feels too tired to leave his room and rarely makes conversation with his daughter. He says that he used to enjoy playing the piano but has not played for several months. He has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows orientation to person, place, and time as well as psychomotor retardation. He has a blunted affect. Attention, concentration, and short- and long-term memory are impaired. Neurological examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B_12 are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",

Patients with AD can present with impairment of daily life and, especially in early stages, show symptoms of depression. However, the onset of AD is usually insidious, with progression over ∼ 8–10 years. The memory of recent events is typically the cognitive domain affected first in patients with AD. For this reason, patients are typically not oriented to person, place, or time. Also, unlike this patient who is concerned about his memory loss, patients with AD are often not aware of their cognitive deficits.",

In patients with late-life depression, cognitive deficits may resemble dementia (i.e., pseudodementia). Compared to patients with other types of dementia, patients with pseudodementia are more likely to be aware of and concerned about memory impairment. Cognitive deficits in MDD typically have a sudden onset and manifest after the mood symptoms (e.g., this patient lost interest in playing the piano several months ago). Treatment of the underlying depression, e.g., with SSRIs such as citalopram, may lead to remission of the depression and reversal of the cognitive deficits. In older patients in particular, different causes of dementia must be considered if memory impairment persists after appropriate treatment and an improvement in depressive symptoms.\n\nSee “Differential diagnosis of subtypes of dementia” table.",

        "explanation_why": "Slowed and reduced amplitude of repetitive movements (e.g., foot tapping, opening and closing the hand, or tapping thumb and index fingers) is a sign of bradykinesia, which is a hallmark feature of PD. In PD, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a deficiency of dopamine in the striatum. Dopamine deficiency in the striatum in turn causes decreased excitatory signaling to the motor cortex, which results in bradykinesia and akinesia. Other common features of PD include shuffling gait, postural instability, and micrographia.\n\nThe diagnosis of PD is clinical; additional tests, including imaging, are not routinely required but should be considered in patients with atypical presentation or to rule out other disorders. To establish the diagnosis of PD, patients must present with bradykinesia in addition to tremor or rigidity.",

While PSP may also cause frequent falls (due to postural instability) and sleep disturbances, this condition is not the most likely cause of this patient's parkinsonism. PSP often manifests with a prolonged prodromal period characterized by headache, arthralgia, dizziness, depression, and fatigue, which are all absent in this patient.

        "explanation_why": "Extensor plantar response occurs in a number of neurological diseases including multiple system atrophy (MSA), which is a Parkinson-plus syndrome. MSA typically affects patients > 50 years of age and manifests with parkinsonism (especially rigidity/stiffness), gait instability, tremor, and REM sleep dysfunction (e.g., thrashing during sleep). However, the majority of patients also have early dysautonomia, most commonly urinary dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension. This patient's absence of autonomic dysfunction makes MSA unlikely.",

However, these features usually only occur during later stages of the disease when cognitive decline (e.g., executive dysfunction) and depression are also commonly present. Most patients with HD initially present with typical features such as chorea and abnormal eye movements, with a symptom onset usually between 20 and 50 years of age. Moreover, HD does not explain this patient's tremor.",

Two falls in a person > 65 years of age may be attributed to tripping, a resting tremor may represent exaggerated physiologic tremor or essential tremor, and thrashing in sleep may be caused by isolated REM dysfunction. However, the combination of all of these symptoms in one patient is concerning for PD. In addition, essential tremor usually worsens with intentional movements, unlike this patient's tremor that improves when he uses his hand to complete a task.",

His symptoms worsen when he is in a meeting and he is concerned that people are noticing it. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient recalls that his father developed bobbing of the head at an older age. He takes no medications. Neurologic examination shows tremor of the right hand with a frequency of approximately 5 Hz when the limbs are relaxed. When the patient is asked to move his arm the tremor decreases. There is reduced arm swing while walking. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "A unilateral resting tremor with a frequency of 4–6 Hz that worsens with stress and improves with voluntary movements, as well as signs of mild bradykinesia (decreased arm swing), are features consistent with Parkinson disease (PD).",

In patients with PD, donepezil is used as an adjunctive treatment for symptoms of dementia.

Initial monotherapy with an anticholinergic (e.g., trihexyphenidyl, benztropine, biperiden) can be considered in patients with PD who are ≤ 65 years of age if the main symptom is resting tremor and there is no evidence of cognitive impairment, significant bradykinesia, or gait disturbance. Alternative pharmacotherapy for patients with PD who are ≤ 65 years of age includes nonergot dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, and/or levodopa/carbidopa. Anticholinergics should be avoided in patients > 65 years of age (particularly those with dementia) because they may worsen psychiatric symptoms and cause urinary retention.\n\nSee “Common types of tremors” table.",

On average, she sleeps 5–6 hours each night. She says that she has also been waking up several times per night and needs about 20 minutes to fall asleep again. She feels mildly tired in the afternoon but does not take any naps. Her husband reports that she does not snore. She takes a 45-minute walk with her husband and their dog every other day. The patient drinks two cups of coffee each morning. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 55 kg (121 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m^2.

            "description": "Dopamine agonists (e.g., ropinirole, bromocriptine) bind to the dopamine receptor, mimicking the action of dopamine.DOPA-Decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitors (e.g., carbidopa) decrease the peripheral conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine, which results in reduced peripheral side-effects of L-DOPA. These drugs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore do not reduce dopamine production in the brain nor do they have central side-effects.Dopamine precursors (e.g., L-DOPA) are converted by DOPA decarboxylase at the presynaptic neuron resulting in direct dopaminergic effects (especially in D2 receptors).COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone, tolcapone) inhibits central (tolcapone) or peripheral (entacapone) catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) resulting in the reduced metabolization of dopamine, increase in dopamine effects, a decreased demand for L-DOPA, and a longer therapeutic effect with each dose.MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline) reduce the metabolism of central dopamine by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase B enzyme, which normally breaks down dopamine (and catecholamines) in the brain. This results in a prolonged dopamine effect and reduced demand for L-DOPA.Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., benztropine) inhibit excitatory cholinergic neurons, resulting in a proportionately lower concentration of acetylcholine compared to dopamine.NMDA antagonists (e.g., amantadine) act as antagonists at the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which results in a dopaminergic effect.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Nonexertional heatstroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's hypothalamic thermoregulatory response is inadequate to maintain a normal temperature. The normal physiologic response to increased body temperature is hypothalamus-mediated peripheral vasodilation (to expose blood to the cooler air) and sweating (to dissipate heat into the environment). In older individuals, these control mechanisms are impaired because of reduced vasodilation and surface area for conductive heat loss. Accordingly, the hypothalamus is less able to adequately regulate temperature in this population, thereby increasing the risk for heatstroke. Treatment for heatstroke consists of rapid reduction of the core body temperature to 39°C (102.2°F) via conductive cooling (immersion in ice water). If immersion is not possible or insufficient, other active cooling methods (e.g., spraying cold water, fanning, cold IV crystalloids) can be considered.",

        "explanation_why": "Warfarin is an anticoagulant that can be used to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Vascular dementia, however, is primarily a small vessel disease caused by lipohyalinosis or microatheroma formation, not thromboemboli, and is primarily treated with antiplatelet agents rather than anticoagulants. Anticoagulants may be indicated in some patients with vascular dementia who have previously had a cardioembolic stroke, but neither the imaging findings in this patient nor his history point towards a previous cardioembolic stroke. Therefore, anticoagulation is not indicated in this patient. In addition, because this patient has a very high fall risk (unsteady gait with decreased muscle strength in the lower extremities and a bruise over the left temple), anticoagulants should be avoided if possible.",

She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche occurred at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and Pap smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The physician recommends pharmacotherapy with raloxifene to prevent further bone resorption.

        "explanation_why": "In postmenopausal women, osteoporosis is most commonly due to estrogen deficiency. Estrogen physiologically prevents bone breakdown by stimulating osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclasts. Raloxifene prevents bone resorption by acting as an estrogen agonist in the bone. At the same time, it has estrogen antagonist qualities in the breast and endometrium. Since estrogen receptors are often expressed on endometrial and breast cancer cells, raloxifene is also indicated for cancer prophylaxis in postmenopausal women with an increased risk of breast cancer. The most severe adverse effects of raloxifene are thromboembolic events, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis; raloxifene is contraindicated in women with a history of or current venous thromboembolic disorders.",

She loses small amounts of urine without warning after coughing or sneezing. She also sometimes forgets the names of her relatives. She is retired and lives at an assisted-living facility. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her older sister recently received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Medications include metformin and enalapril. Vital signs are within normal limits. She walks without any problems. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is normal.

        "explanation_why": "Urethral hypermobility is one of the most common causes of stress incontinence and is caused by impaired support from the pelvic floor. At times of increased intraabdominal pressure (e.g., laughing, coughing, sneezing), the proximal urethra and the bladder neck descend out of the pelvis and transmit more pressure to the bladder. During this process, intraurethral pressure falls below bladder pressure, resulting in urine leakage. Considering this patient's age and gender, urethral hypermobility can result from postmenopausal estrogen loss and as part of the normal aging process.\n\nTreatment of stress incontinence includes lifestyle modifications, Kegel exercises, and insertion of a vaginal pessary. If conservative treatment is insufficient, pharmacological and surgical treatment can be considered.",

However, the absence of gait disturbance, which is typically the initial and most prominent symptom of the disease, makes this diagnosis unlikely. Also, the incontinence in NPH is usually of the urge type, in which the patient experiences a strong, sudden urge to urinate, followed by urinary leakage.

Over the past 3 months she has been waking up early and having trouble falling asleep at night. During this period, she has had a decreased appetite and a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. Since the death of her husband one year ago, she has been living with her son and his wife. She is worried and feels guilty because she does not want to impose on them. She has stopped going to meetings at the senior center because she no longer enjoys them and because she feels uncomfortable asking her son to give her a ride, especially since he has been under a great deal of stress lately. She is 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 51 kg (110 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is tired and has a flattened affect. Cognition is intact. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

This causes individuals to feel the need to go to bed early and to wake up early in the morning regardless of when they go to bed. A patient who delays going to bed will therefore not get an adequate quantity of sleep, resulting in daytime sleepiness. Advanced sleep phase disorder is frequently associated with older age.",

However, since this patient does not have other features of depression such as anhedonia, a depressed mood, and/or a change in appetite, another disorder is more likely. In older patients with sleep disturbances, a thorough history should be obtained and mental status examination performed in order to rule out major depressive disorder. This is important because the diagnosis of depression is often missed in older adults despite a relatively high prevalence.",

This patient, however, wakes up spontaneously early in the morning. Moreover, delayed sleep phase disorder causes individuals to go to bed later than normal (usually 1–4 AM) and would not result in excessive sleepiness in the evening.

He tried taking acetaminophen, but it provided no relief from his symptoms. There is no family history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He occasionally drinks one beer. Vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the right tibia is bowing anteriorly; range of motion is limited by pain. An x-ray of the right leg shows a deformed tibia with multiple lesions of increased and decreased density and a thickened cortical bone. Laboratory studies show markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and normal calcium and phosphate levels. This patient is most likely to develop which of the following complications?",

The knee pain is worse when she walks for longer than 30 minutes. When she wakes up in the morning, her fingers and knees are stiff for about 15 minutes. She cannot recall any trauma to the joints. She was treated with amoxicillin following a tick bite 2 years ago. She is otherwise healthy and only takes a multivitamin and occasionally acetaminophen for the pain. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 133/78 mm Hg. Examination of the lower extremities shows mild genu varum. Range of motion of both knees is limited; there is palpable crepitus. Complete flexion and extension elicit pain. Tender nodules are present on the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index, ring, and little fingers bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Although this patient sustained a past tick bite, which could have infected her with Borrelia burgdorferi, she was already treated with amoxicillin, the first-line therapy for Lyme disease. Additionally, she shows no extraarticular signs of the condition. Lastly, Lyme arthritis does not cause crepitus, genu varum, and interphalangeal nodes.",

Moreover, the characteristic hand deformities from long-standing RA are swan-neck deformity and Boutonniere deformity as opposed to the interphalangeal joint nodes seen in this patient.",

        "description": "12-lead ECG (paper speed: 25 mm/s)– Bursts of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT; rate ∼ 220/min) alternating with sinus beats\n– During the VT phases, the QRS complexes are wide (∼ 200 ms) and appear to be twisting around the isoelectric line, producing a spindle-shaped pattern (best seen in V_1 rhythm strip; indicated by green ellipse).These findings are characteristic of torsades de pointes (TdP), a subtype of polymorphic VT.Note how the sinus rhythm converts to VT/TdP as a result of the R-on-T phenomenon (best seen in rhythm strip V_6): a premature ventricular complex (PVC; red line) occurs in the downslope of the preceding T wave, initiating VT/TdP.",

He has not seen a physician since he retired from his job on a production line at a shoe factory 5 years ago. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows nontender, bilateral axillary, and right-sided inguinal lymphadenopathy. The spleen is palpated 7 cm below the left costal margin and the liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 13.5 g/dL, leukocyte count of 40,000/mm^3 with marked lymphocytosis, and a thrombocyte count of 97,000/mm^3. Peripheral blood smear shows numerous mature lymphocytes and smudge cells. Flow cytometry shows B cells that express CD20.

    "question_text": "A 70-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and lower back pain for the past 4 months. The back pain worsened significantly after he had a minor fall while doing yard work the previous day. The patient's brother died of prostate cancer at the age of 75 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm, severe tenderness over the second lumbar vertebra, and mild tenderness over the lower thoracic vertebrae.

SPEP can detect monoclonal production of a protein by a malignant plasma cell, showing a characteristic abnormal peak (M spike) in the γ-globulin region. Subsequent serum immunofixation enables determination of the type of monoclonal protein, with most cases being due to abnormal production of IgG (50%) or IgA (25%). In patients with MM, anemia (and possibly thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) results from bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells with suppression of normal hematopoiesis. Hypercalcemia is caused by increased production of osteoclast-activating factors that result in osteolysis.\n\nIf SPEP confirms abnormal plasma cell protein production, a 24-hour urinary collection for protein electrophoresis and immunofixation is indicated to detect the possible presence of light chains in the urine (Bence Jones protein), which can cause renal failure due to cast nephropathy.",

The diagnosis of PMR is established based on typical clinical symptoms and laboratory findings (elevated acute phase reactants, normal creatine kinase, negative rheumatoid factor, and no autoantibodies). Symptomatic relief is typically achieved quickly after therapy is initiated, and the glucocorticoid dose can be slowly tapered until the patient is in full remission. If symptoms do not begin to improve within 2 weeks, the glucocorticoid dose should be increased.",

She reports that she feels out of breath when walking for more than one block and while climbing stairs. She has tried to lose weight for several years without success. She goes for a walk 3 times a week but she has difficulty following a low-calorie diet. During the past 12 months, she has had two urinary tract infections that were treated with fosfomycin. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis. Her only current medication is metformin. She has never smoked. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 39 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows cracking in both knees on passive movement. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show an HbA1c of 9.5%, and a fasting serum glucose concentration of 158 mg/dL. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    "hint": "This patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with recurrent urinary tract infections, and a hemoglobin A1c of 9.5%, both of which suggest insufficient glycemic control with her current medication regimen.

        "explanation_why": "GLP-1 agonists, such as exenatide, can cause weight loss and control hyperglycemia. Incretin-based therapeutic agents such as GLP-1 agonists also have the additional benefit of a low risk of medication-induced hypoglycemia. Besides metformin and GLP-1 agonists, other drugs that can be used for weight loss in diabetic patients include SGLT-2 inhibitors (e.g., dapagliflozin), orlistat, and pramlintide. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections, as is the case here. Also, orlistat does not cause glycemic control, which is desired in this patient, and pramlintide is only used in combination with insulin therapy.",

The increased intracellular calcium stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas.\n- Incretin mimetics/GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide): bind to GLP-1 receptors and are resistant to degradation by DPP-4 enzyme → ↑ insulin secretion, ↓ glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying\n- DPP-4 inhibitors/gliptins (e.g., sitagliptin): indirectly increase the endogenous incretin effect by inhibiting DPP-4 enzyme that breaks down GLP-1 → ↑ insulin secretion, ↓ glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying",

Over the past year, he has had problems initiating urination and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He does not drink alcohol. His medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, and daily aspirin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a pulsatile abdominal mass at the level of the umbilicus and a bruit on auscultation. Digital rectal examination shows a symmetrically enlarged, smooth, firm, nontender prostate with rubbery texture. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "This patient has a history of smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and arterial hypertension and presents with a pulsatile abdominal mass and a bruit on auscultation. These features are suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He does not have abdominal, back, or flank pain, flank ecchymoses, or signs of hemodynamic instability that would suggest rupture.",

This test provides a detailed assessment of the location, size, and extent of the aneurysm, as well as the involvement of branch vessels, presence of a thrombus, and/or rupture. Signs of symptomatic AAA include abdominal, back, or flank pain, flank ecchymoses, and signs of aortic fistula (e.g., heart failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding), which this patient does not have. A different step in management is more appropriate for asymptomatic AAA.",

She has had dull lower back pain for several months, which suddenly became sharp in nature after lifting a heavy bucket of water 2 days ago. The pain is midline and does not radiate. She has had frequent vaginal dryness and hot flashes since menopause at the age of 55 years, for which she is on hormone replacement therapy. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hypothyroidism. Her other medications include hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and levothyroxine. She attends a 30-minute power walking class twice a week. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. She does not drink alcohol. She does not appear in distress. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lb); her BMI is 28 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows midline lumbar tenderness. Muscle strength is full and deep tendon reflexes are 2+. Straight leg raising is negative but painful. MRI of the spine shows an acute compression fracture of the L3 vertebral body and an old compression fracture of the L4 vertebra. Which of the following factors in this patient's history is the strongest predisposing factor for her condition?",

    "question_text": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of persistent pain in her right shoulder. The pain is localized to the top of the shoulder and is worse with movement. She has stiffness in the right shoulder that is worse in the morning and usually lasts 20 minutes. The patient reports that she is unable to brush her hair and has stopped going to her regular tennis lessons because of the pain. She does not recall any fall or trauma. When her right arm is passively abducted in an arc, there is pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction. When asked to lower the right arm slowly from 90 degrees of abduction, she is unable to hold her arm up and it drops to her side. Passive range of motion is normal. Injection of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine into the right subacromial space does not relieve the pain or improve active range of motion of the right arm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This patient's pain with passive abduction between 60 and 120 degrees suggests impingement and/or rotator cuff disease, and the weakness seen on the drop arm test further narrows the diagnosis to a tear in the supraspinatus muscle of the rotator cuff. It is important to note that the sensitivity and specificity of these physical examination maneuvers are limited, especially with regard to rotator cuff tears; musculoskeletal ultrasound and/or MRI should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",

            "description": "The top image shows a cross-section of the shoulder joint.The bottom images show the progression of a degenerative rotator cuff tear. Repetitive overhead movement and/or anatomical variants of the acromion can result in inflammation of the subacromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons (left). This may progress to degeneration of the bursa and tendons (middle). As a result, the tendon fibers are less elastic and prone to tear, resulting in a rotator cuff tear (right). The supraspinatus tendon is most commonly affected.",

    "hint": "This patient's hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and delayed capillary refill, along with hypernatremia (likely chronic—i.e., developing over the past 2 weeks) and elevated creatinine concentration, should raise concern for hypernatremia with severe hypovolemia.

Rapid correction of hypernatremia carries a risk of causing cerebral edema. Additionally, intravenous infusion of free water can cause hemolysis (due to the large difference in tonicity between free water and red blood cells).",

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous administration of 0.9% saline, an isotonic fluid, is the best initial step in the management of this patient with severe hypovolemia and hypernatremia. Although normal saline only increases extracellular fluid volume and has a minimal effect on lowering the serum sodium concentration, it should be administered first in a patient with hypovolemic shock to prevent severe complications of volume depletion, such as myocardial and/or cerebral ischemia. After adequate expansion of the extracellular fluid volume, the next step in management is to correct the hypernatremia with a gradual infusion of 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline. Hypotonic saline is preferred in patients with subacute or chronic mild hypovolemic hypernatremia because it corrects the free water deficit without rapidly decreasing the serum osmolality, which can cause cerebral edema.",

Additionally, untreated cellulitis would have progressed more quickly and the timeline of her symptoms is not consistent with this diagnosis.",

Older adults, especially those with dementia, are at increased risk for abuse. Older adult abuse is most commonly perpetrated by caregivers (e.g., spouse, nursing home staff) and can be physical, psychological, or financial, or take the form of neglect. Physicians are legally and ethically obligated to report suspected abuse. When a physician suspects abuse, they should privately speak with the affected patient, ask for further information, and offer assistance.\n\nFinally, this patient's decreased MCV and hemoglobin are consistent with microcytic anemia (e.g., due to insufficient iron intake) but do not indicate an increased bleeding risk.",

However, an ethics consult is more appropriate if there is a conflict between the four core bioethics principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.

If a resolution of the disagreement is not possible, the husband will most likely have the final say as his wife's next of kin.\n\nThe role of PEG placement in patients with dementia is controversial; studies have found no survival benefit or increase in quality of life in patients with advanced dementia who received PEG feeding compared with no tube feeding.",

Lastly, laboratory values typically elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer, including CA 19-9, CEA, and lipase, are all normal. This combination of findings makes pancreatic cancer an unlikely cause of this patient's symptoms.",

This results in thickened cortical bone that nevertheless breaks easily. Typical clinical manifestations are cranial nerve palsies, and pancytopenia, none of which is seen in this patient.

This patient has numerous risk factors for osteoporosis including female gender, advanced age, postmenopausal state, and tobacco use. In patients with osteoporosis, relatively minor trauma can cause fractures.\n\nPostmenopausal women are especially prone to osteoporotic fractures due to increased bone resorption.

The increased intracellular calcium stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas.\n- Incretin mimetics/GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide): bind to GLP-1 receptors and are resistant to degradation by DPP-4 enzyme → ↑ insulin secretion, ↓ glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying\n- DPP-4 inhibitors/gliptins (e.g., sitagliptin): indirectly increase the endogenous incretin effect by inhibiting DPP-4 enzyme that breaks down GLP-1 → ↑ insulin secretion, ↓ glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying",

This accounts for increased skin laxity and rigidity. Atrophy of the dermis due to loss of collagen and volume deficit as a result of reduced glycosaminoglycan synthesis further contribute to the appearance of chronologically aged skin. Moreover, aging skin is prone to xerosis secondary to moisture loss resulting from diminished lipid and sebum production at the surface.",

Moreover, a decrease in fibroblast activity contributes to delayed wound healing.",

The condition can manifest with symptoms such as memory impairment, personality changes, and paresthesias, which could lead to gait abnormalities. However, vitamin B_12 deficiency typically results in loss of distal vibratory sense in the extremities (lower > upper), which is not present in this patient. Furthermore, urinary urgency would not be explained by B12 deficiency.",

If symptoms are severe, combination treatment of levodopa with carbidopa and/or a COMT inhibitor (e.g, entacapone) can be initiated. Levodopa is more effective than dopamine agonists. However, levodopa therapy is usually reserved for elderly patients or patients with cognitive impairment.\n\nMAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline) or amantadine can be used as monotherapy in patients with minimal symptoms that do not affect quality of life, or as an adjunct with dopamine agonists or levodopa in more severe cases.",

Estrogen physiologically prevents bone breakdown by stimulating osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclasts. Raloxifene prevents bone resorption by acting as an agonist on estrogen receptors in the bone. At the same time, it acts as an estrogen antagonist in the breast and endometrium. The most severe adverse effects of raloxifene are thromboembolic events, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis. Raloxifene is therefore contraindicated in women with a history of or current venous thromboembolic disorders.",

        "explanation_why": "Increased lung compliance is commonly found in individuals of advanced age due to loss of elastic fibers. Chest wall compliance typically decreases because of increased chest wall stiffness. Stiffening of the chest wall and loss of elastic recoil impair lung emptying during expiration, which results in increased residual volume. When compared to a healthy young adult, individuals of advanced age have increased alveolar dead space and V/Q mismatch due to age-related loss of lung surface area. Moreover, while aging classically leads to a decrease in FEV_1  and vital capacity, total lung capacity usually remains unchanged.\n\nOther age-related changes include decreased respiratory muscle strength (which can hinder effective coughing and increase the risk of aspiration and infection) and impaired ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "According to the Beers criteria, physicians should avoid prescribing ≥ 3 CNS-active drugs in geriatric patients because combining these drugs can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, and delirium, which can increase the risk of falls and resulting fractures. CNS-active drugs include antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, SNRIs), antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, and opioids. Older patients are especially sensitive to benzodiazepines. This patient's orthostatic presyncope and hearing loss are also risk factors for falls. In addition, there is a higher risk of fractures in this patient, who has risk factors for decreased bone mineral density (e.g., postmenopausal woman, glitazone use).\n\nPolypharmacy is often unavoidable in older patients because of the presence of multiple comorbidities but can sometimes occur as a result of a prescription cascade. Polypharmacy is associated with a greater risk of poor patient compliance, medical errors, decreased therapeutic efficacy, and/or adverse drug reactions (due to drug-drug interactions). Strategies to avoid polypharmacy and its complications include adherence to the Beers criteria, medication reconciliation, and periodic medication reviews with the use of drug-interaction checkers.",

He has nontremor-dominant Parkinson disease that was diagnosed at the age of 68 after developing progressive bradykinesia and rigidity. He lives alone following the death of his wife 2 years ago. The patient's son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren live nearby and help him with daily activities. Current medications include levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. He appears well. Neurologic examination shows mild hypomimia, bradydiadochokinesia, shortened steps, and mild gait shuffling. During the examination, the patient mentions that he drove himself to his appointment today because he does not want to feel like a burden on his son. The physician is concerned that the patient's illness and medications potentially impair his driving skills. The patient stresses that he has never had an accident in his life and is a very safe driver. He also states that he has felt isolated since his wife's passing and likes to meet up with old friends at a local bar. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction by the physician?",

        "explanation_why": "A physician should encourage patients to communicate with their family members and seek help when necessary. However, it is inappropriate for the physician to presume that the patient's son would be willing to drive for the patient. The physician should instead explore the patient's reasons for feeling like a burden on his son, rather than simply instructing him not to feel this way. Moreover, in this case, it is critical to inform the patient that his current condition impairs his ability to drive safely; a different reaction would, therefore, be appropriate.",

        "explanation_why": "Irrespective of state laws, if a physician believes that a patient cannot drive safely, the physician must share their concerns with the patient and ask them to stop driving until they have been evaluated and treated by a driver rehabilitation specialist. Alternatively, the patient can be recleared for driving by the state licensing authority (e.g., Department of Motor Vehicles). However, the laws for reporting impaired drivers differ between states.\n\nMost states have voluntary reporting laws, under which a physician is not required to disclose a patient's driving impairment to the state licensing authority but are protected from a breach of patient confidentiality if they do so. Some states have mandatory reporting laws, which require physicians to report any patient with driving impairment to the state licensing authority. In states with voluntary or mandatory reporting laws, the physician can be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not report the driving impairment. A few states do not have any reporting laws and require the physician to obtain the patient's consent before disclosing driving impairment to the authorities. In these states, the physician cannot be held liable for a motor vehicle accident involving the impaired driver if the physician does not have consent to disclose driver impairment.",

She comments that “the bright sunlight makes me see halos around lights and then I cannot distinguish between the nuances of colors anymore.” The patient recently stopped driving at night because she no longer trusts her eyes. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and atrial fibrillation. She has smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years and occasionally drinks 1–2 glasses of wine. Her medications include metformin, albuterol, budesonide-formoterol, digoxin, and rivaroxaban. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 89/min and irregular, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination shows visual acuity of 20/80 in both eyes. On fundoscopic examination, the retina is hard to visualize and the red reflex appears darkened. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Additionally, this condition does not cause a temporary improvement in near vision, darkening of the red reflex, and obscuration of the ocular fundus.

This condition is caused by age-related damage to hair cells at the base of the cochlea. Although otoscopy and audiometry would eventually be indicated to establish the diagnosis, high-frequency hearing loss is an expected finding in older patients and does not require immediate investigation.",

        "explanation_why": "Vertical or rotatory nystagmus on neurologic examination is considered abnormal in all age groups and warrants immediate investigation. Causes for vertical nystagmus include vestibular conditions (e.g., anterior and posterior semicircular canal BPPV), severe alcohol intoxication, drug side effects (e.g., phencyclidine, lithium, carbamazepine, phenytoin), Wernicke encephalopathy, and CNS lesions (e.g., bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia in multiple sclerosis, cerebellar lesions). In contrast, although horizontal nystagmus is most frequently pathological, it can occur physiologically (e.g., end-gaze nystagmus) in all age groups. Other neurophthalmological findings considered normal in older patients (especially those aged over 80 years) are sluggish convergence, sluggish pupillary reflex, decreased upward gaze (while lateral and downward movements usually remain intact), and impaired accommodation (presbyopia).",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "Diffuse abdominal pain and distention, palpable masses in the lower abdomen, and hard stool on digital rectal examination are consistent with fecal impaction. Patients with fecal impaction can develop paradoxical diarrhea with leakage of watery stool past the impacted segment of the rectum.",

It can be considered if there are signs of impending bowel perforation or ischemia (e.g., severe abdominal tenderness), which is not the case here. A more conservative treatment modality should be tried first.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Fecal impaction is most commonly seen in older adults with reduced mobility, such as this patient. The initial management of fecal impaction involves manual fragmentation of the compacted feces. This procedure can be followed with warm water or mineral oil enemas to soften the stool and facilitate further evacuation of the colon. Once the fecal impaction is treated, lifestyle modifications such as a high-fiber diet and physical therapy should be initiated, together with a maintenance bowel regimen (e.g., osmotic laxative therapy) to prevent recurrence. Untreated fecal impaction can lead to complications such as intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, stercoral ulcers, stercoral colitis, and fistulas.\n\nDigital rectal examination may not detect a fecal impaction if the location is in the proximal rectum or sigmoid colon. In these cases, an x-ray of the abdomen may show large, speckled, low-density opacities within distended loops of the large bowel and rectum.",

The most commonly used conservative methods include vaginal pessaries and pelvic floor muscle training (e.g., Kegel exercises). Patients should also be advised on lifestyle modifications that help prevent the progression of POP through the reduction of intraabdominal pressure, such as weight loss, smoking cessation (to prevent chronic cough), and constipation treatment (to prevent straining).

    "question_text": "A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. He describes the pain as an 8/10 in intensity with no radiation. He denies fever or chills. He has not passed urine since the early morning. He took oral diphenhydramine last night because he had difficulty falling asleep. He has a history of hypertension. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily but quit 1 year ago. Current medications include amlodipine. He appears restless. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 134/90 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows a tender palpable suprapubic mass. Digital rectal examination shows a mildly enlarged, nontender prostate without any palpable masses. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A bedside ultrasound scan shows a large anechoic mass in the lower abdomen. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 134/90 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows a tender palpable suprapubic mass. Digital rectal examination shows a mildly enlarged, nontender prostate without any palpable masses. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A bedside ultrasound scan shows a large anechoic mass in the lower abdomen. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "This patient's anuria and palpable suprapubic mass along with a distended bladder (anechoic mass) on ultrasound suggest acute urinary retention (AUR). First-generation antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) increase the risk of developing this condition, especially in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (as suggested by an enlarged, smooth, and nontender prostate on digital rectal examination).",

However, in a patient with urolithiasis, the pain is usually colicky and, since most calculi contain calcium, a hyperechoic calculus with an acoustic shadow is typically seen on ultrasound. In a patient with AUR, a different step is more appropriate at this point.",

        "explanation_why": "Relief of the overfilled bladder via transurethral catheterization is the treatment of choice for patients with AUR. Drug-induced AUR can result from decreased detrusor muscle contractility or increased urethral sphincter tone. Decreased detrusor muscle contractility is usually due to the anticholinergic effects of drugs such as anticholinergics, first-generation antihistamines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Increased urethral sphincter tone is typically due to the sympathomimetic effects of drugs such as beta and alpha-adrenergic agonists. Precipitating drugs, (e.g., drugs with sympathomimetic or anticholinergic effects) should be discontinued or substituted.",

However, the lesion is initially small with a rough, sandpaper-like surface, which grows slowly in size and becomes erythematous and scaly. Solar lentigo should be managed differently.",

Flat, brown macules or patches occur as a result of the overproduction of melanin by existing keratinocytes or from the proliferation of melanocytes caused by prolonged sun exposure. No further interventions are necessary unless patients desire the removal of solar lentigines for cosmetic reasons. Limiting exposure to the sun as well as applying sunscreen can prevent the development of new lesions and decrease the darkening of existing lesions.",

Three years ago, when he was no longer able to perform daily tasks and take care of himself, the patient moved in with his daughter, who is his surrogate decision-maker. Over the past year, he has been treated twice for food poisoning. He takes no medications. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 56 kg (115 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m^2. He appears tired and is oriented only to person. His temperature is 36.3°C (97.3°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/63 mm Hg. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and dry skin and mucous membranes; capillary refill time is 2 seconds. There is a tender, nonblanching, erythematous area over the patient's sacrum with superficial skin loss. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation and increased bowel sounds. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. Neurologic examination shows ankle clonus and an ataxic gait. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 9/30. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.0 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 116 μm^3, and leukocyte count is 13,800/mm^3 (14% eosinophils). Microscopic evaluation of the stool shows multiple eggs of Diphyllobothrium latum. The patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment and further evaluation. The daughter asks if the patient could be treated at home. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

In the US, physicians are legally and ethically obligated to report suspected older adult abuse to Adult Protective Services if the patient lives at home or with a relative or to the Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs if the abuse occurred in an institution (e.g., assisted living facility). Apart from investigating complaints, these agencies protect older adults by providing them with social, medical, and legal aid.",

She says that she has not lost consciousness but “simply tripped over a rock.” A similar event happened 2 weeks ago when she fell while grocery shopping. She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her family history is significant for Parkinson disease. She does not smoke cigarettes and drinks one to two glasses of wine each week. Current medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, aspirin, metformin, and empagliflozin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg. Examination shows an abrasion on her right knee and a deep cut on her right hand. Neurologic examination shows normal sensation to pinprick and vibration. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the left lower limb and 2+ in the right lower limb. She was able to get up out of her chair and walk to the wall and back to the chair without any problems. Which of the following is the most important risk factor for future falls in this patient?",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's history of previous falls is the main risk factor for future falls. Falls in older individuals are usually due to a combination of age-related factors (e.g., lower-extremity weakness, cognitive and/or visual impairment), underlying medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson disease, osteoarthritis of the knee, orthostatic hypotension), and environmental hazards (e.g., slippery surfaces). Certain medications, such as benzodiazepines, increase the risk of falling. Patients who have fallen should undergo a risk assessment that involves testing of visual acuity, cognitive, neurological, musculoskeletal, and hearing function, postural vital signs, and past medical history including information about the circumstances of the current as well as previous falls. Strategies to prevent further falls include minimizing medications, physical therapy, and modifying the older individual's home environment.",

For asymptomatic lesions, such as the one seen here, treatment is generally not necessary and reassurance with follow-up is sufficient. If atypical features are present (e.g., asymmetry, rapid change or growth, ulceration) or if the diagnosis is unclear, a biopsy may be indicated. Treatment with cryotherapy, laser therapy, or surgical excision is appropriate for cosmetic removal or if the lesion becomes symptomatic (e.g., pruritic, painful, or bleeds easily).\n\nIn patients with the sudden appearance of multiple seborrheic keratoses, known as the Leser-Trélat sign, further investigation is necessary because of this feature's association with malignancies such as lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer.",

He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He is physically active and exercises three to four times weekly. His medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and aspirin. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 80 kg (177 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m^2. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F), pulse is 76/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 120/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows ecchymoses on the dorsal aspect of the patient's forearms bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 205,000/mm^3, a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time of 30 seconds, and a bleeding time of 3 minutes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's physical examination findings?",

It is caused by progressive loss of dermal connective tissue, subcutaneous fat, and blood vessel elasticity with age, all of which results in increased susceptibility to bruising in elderly individuals. Senile purpura is more common in light-skinned persons (due to increased sensitivity to sunlight) and typically develops on sun-exposed areas (e.g., forearms, face, neck). The diagnosis is clinical and does not require further evaluation.",

        "explanation_why": "Physical therapy is indicated in all older adults with evidence of poor gait, strength, or balance (e.g., patients with Parkinson disease). In addition to physical therapy, this patient would benefit from a fall risk assessment to identify more personalized preventive measures (e.g., occupational therapy, home hazard assessment and modification). Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in adults aged ≥ 65 years. All older adults should be counseled on fall prevention strategies and screened for fall risk annually, beginning with the question: “Have you fallen in the past year?” A fall risk assessment should be performed for individuals who screen positive for fall risk and those who present after an acute fall.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Prolonged hospitalization can raise certain risks (e.g., hospital-acquired infections) in older patients and disrupt others' access to care. In addition, physicians should be mindful of the impact on health care resources (e.g., staffing, health care costs). This patient is medically stable and should not be kept at the hospital any longer than necessary.",

        "explanation_why": "The physician should involve the patient's family and future caregivers in discharge planning and identify who will be primarily responsible for understanding the discharge instructions. However, physicians, together with other health care personnel, are obligated to ensure safe discharge planning, and this responsibility cannot be transferred to a family member.",

        "explanation_why": "An inpatient program (e.g., assisted living facilities) may be appropriate for patients who require skilled care services. However, assuming that a safe discharge can be ensured, the patient's needs and preferences should also be considered during discharge planning. Therefore, discharge to an assisted living facility without prior discussion with the patient and their family is inappropriate.",

        "is_correct": false,
        "explanation_why": "Physicians should involve patients in decision-making processes (e.g., discharge planning) and respect their individual preferences. This patient with a history of stroke, hemiparesis, and mild cognitive impairment requires skilled medical services (e.g., physical therapy, skilled nursing care) and is unlikely to be able to travel to outpatient therapy. Therefore, a plan that only consists of regular outpatient visits is not feasible.",

        "content": "Involve a social worker in discharge planning",
        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The physician is responsible for assessing whether to involve a multidisciplinary team of discharge planners (usually social workers and/or nurses). Discharge planners can be especially helpful for patients who are at high risk for adverse events after discharge and require ongoing skilled care. Discharge planning should be initiated as early as possible and includes a psychosocial assessment, discharge counseling, medication reconciliation, planning of follow-up visits, and coordination of services. The patient, their family, and future caregivers should be involved to establish a plan that meets the patient's medical needs and personal preferences. Effective discharge planning can increase patient satisfaction, reduce the duration of hospitalization, and decrease readmission rates.\n\nHome health care should be considered for patients who live at home and require complex ongoing care but are unable to travel. This form of rehabilitation reduces costs while avoiding the risks associated with prolonged hospitalization (e.g., nosocomial infections).",

If nonpharmacological treatment fails, treatment with an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist (e.g., midodrine) is indicated. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonists, which are also used to treat recurrent vasovagal syncope and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, increase vascular tone and thereby increase blood pressure. Contraindications for alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonists include urinary retention and hypertension. Alternative first-line medications for neurogenic orthostatic syncope include fludrocortisone and droxidopa but droxidopa may interact with antiparkinson drugs.",

Medical history is remarkable for hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, for which he uses nocturnal PAP. The patient is widowed, lives alone, and has two adult children. Medications are amlodipine and ramipril. He does not drink alcoholic beverages or smoke cigarettes. He is not in acute distress. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (181 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m^2^. Temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Cardiac examination reveals an S4 heart sound most prominent at the apex and a grade 4 late systolic ejection murmur best heard in the second right intercostal space. The murmur radiates bilaterally to the carotids and decreases in intensity with handgrip. Which of the following factors in this patient most strongly predicts a poor prognosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Dyspnea is an early sign of heart failure, which occurs in severe AS as a result of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. While patients with AS can be asymptomatic for years, the onset of symptoms usually indicates a progression to severe AS. Mortality rates increase from less than 1% per year in asymptomatic patients to over 50% within the first two years after the onset of symptoms if left untreated. Dyspnea is the strongest predictor of a poor prognosis, followed by syncope and angina pectoris. Approximately half of AS patients with dyspnea die within 2 years of symptom onset. Aortic valve replacement can slow the rapid decline in life expectancy after the onset of symptoms.",

Mild to moderate AS typically manifests with an early peaking murmur, while severe AS is characterized by a longer late systolic murmur. While most murmurs with an intensity of grade 3 or higher are pathological, their intensity does not always correlate with the clinical severity of the underlying lesion.

        "explanation_why": "This patient has clearly stated her wishes regarding intubation and resuscitation, and there is no concern about her mental capacity to make this decision. The best way to document her preferences is to complete a portable orders for life-sustaining therapy (POLST) form, which turns a patient’s care preferences into specific medical orders that easily travel with the patient across the healthcare system and can be directly used in a medical emergency. The POLST form is completed by the patient's healthcare provider and is signed by both the provider and the patient (or healthcare proxy if the patient does not have decision-making capacity). Regulations vary by state regarding which providers can complete POLST forms, and may include physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. In some US states, POLST is known by medical orders for life-sustaining treatment (MOLST), physician orders for scope of treatment (POST), or another similar term. One copy of the POLST form should be retained by the patient or healthcare proxy, ideally in a place that is easily accessible in the case of an emergency, and another copy remains in a prominent place in the patient’s medical records. The POLST form can be changed by a healthcare provider according to the patient’s or healthcare proxy’s wishes.\n\nA living will, on the other hand, is a legal document outlining a patient's preferences in a broad range of potential future scenarios in which they cannot make decisions due to incapacitation. Living wills are prepared by the patient and can guide healthcare providers but are not medical orders and are not easily portable across different care settings.",

        "explanation_why": "It is important to continue the discussion with all involved caregivers (in this case, both the son and the daughter). A good way to start is by asking family members how they think the patient is doing. This allows the clinician to explore the family’s understanding of the patient’s illness and to identify any disparities in understanding the patient's prognosis that might be the cause of disagreement among family members. Care should be person-centered (i.e., aligned with the patient’s goals) to avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment of symptoms and based on the principle of substituted judgment. However, specific questions about the patient's goals of care should be deferred until the family’s prognostic awareness is assessed, so that clinicians can ensure families have the information they need to engage in shared decision-making regarding the next steps.\n\nDuring advance care planning, it is also important to identify the appropriate legal surrogate decision-maker appointed by the patient. If no one has been appointed, as in this scenario, the physician should help the family assign someone to be a healthcare proxy. These steps can help prevent conflicts in the future. In addition, family members should be assessed for caregiver fatigue and should receive support for that as needed. In this particular case, the clinician should also talk with the family about referral to palliative medicine and explore hospice eligibility for this patient.",

Three days earlier, his oncologist informed him that his prognosis was poor, estimating his survival at “weeks to months.” Since that appointment, he has been tearful, thinking about the things that he will never get a chance to experience. He reports some difficulty sleeping, low energy, difficulty concentrating, and a loss of appetite. He has not informed his wife or children of his diagnosis or prognosis because he is very anxious about how they would react.

Limited support systems and maladaptive coping mechanisms are common causes of prolonged or debilitating distress. Patients can be educated on adaptive coping techniques such as social coping (seeking support from friends, family, or community), problem-focused coping (targeting the underlying cause of stress), and proactive coping (strategies pursued in anticipation of a stressor).\n\nFor a patient who is newly diagnosed with a serious illness, active treatment of depressive symptoms with psychotherapy or medications may help. If the patient survives long enough, it will become clearer whether their mood symptoms are transient or if their symptoms are the result of complicated grief or a mood disorder.",

Older individuals with delirium are at high risk of falls, pulling out lines, and harming themselves. Nonpharmacological interventions such as frequent reorientation, ensuring appropriate lighting, minimizing overstimulation, and close observation are first line. A sitter can provide immediate supervision, redirect unsafe behaviors, and reduce the need for restraints or sedative medications, both of which can worsen delirium and increase the risk of injury or death.
