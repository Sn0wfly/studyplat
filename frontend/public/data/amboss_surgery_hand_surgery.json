    "question_text": "A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain, tingling, and numbness in his right hand that started 3 months ago. The symptoms are worse at night and frequently wake him up. The symptoms can be relieved by shaking his hands but soon recur. He reports weakness of his right hand, especially when grasping objects. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are metformin and sitagliptin. Four months ago he went on a camping trip. He has been working as a landscape gardener for 8 years. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows reproduction of his symptoms when his right hand is held above his head for 2 minutes. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin\n13.2 g/dL\n\nLeukocyte count\n7600/mm^3\n\nHemoglobin A_1C\n\n6.3%\n\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n13 mm/h\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "ELISA for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies is a serologic test for diagnosing Lyme disease. Although Lyme disease may manifest with peripheral neuropathy, this patient has not experienced the typical erythema migrans and there is no history of a tick bite. Although these factors are not always positive in Lyme disease, neurologic manifestations associated with the condition would not be exacerbated by certain movements. Lastly, Lyme disease is typically associated with an elevated ESR and sometimes elevated leukocytes, but this patient's values are normal.",

        "explanation_why": "A CT scan of the cervical spine would be indicated for suspected cervical radiculopathy (e.g., caused by a herniated disc or a tumor). Cervical radiculopathy can manifest with pain, tingling, and numbness of the hands as well, but it usually also causes neck and shoulder pain, which this patient lacks. Additionally, exacerbation during the night or during activities involving the hands (e.g., grasping objects) is not consistent with cervical radiculopathy, which is rather exacerbated by neck extension.",

This patient's history of hand paresthesia and pain exacerbated at night (due to reduced circulation and muscle movements during REM sleep) and while grasping objects is typical for CTS. Additionally, his occupation as a landscape gardener is a risk factor since CTS is associated with manual work leading to repetitive and forceful flexion and extension of the wrist. Provocative tests used in the diagnosis of CTS include Phalen, Tinel, and, as seen here, hand elevation tests.",

Although MS may manifest with peripheral paresthesia, it is usually associated with several other manifestations such as vision loss or ataxia. Additionally, as the defect is located in the central nervous system (not the periphery), symptoms would not worsen when the patient raises his hand.",

This condition may manifest with claudication, weakness, and numbness of the affected extremity, which are symptoms that this patient has. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus, which may predispose him to PAD. However, the condition most commonly affects the legs and very rarely the hands. Furthermore, this patient's history (i.e., manual worker with symptoms that exacerbate during the night and while grabbing objects) is more suggestive of a different diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "In uncomplicated extensor digitorum tendon injuries (no associated displaced fractures, extension deficit < 45°), a stack splint is used to stabilize the joint for 6–8 weeks in slight hyperextension in order to achieve a close approximation of the tendon ends and full recovery. When applying splints to areas with bony protuberances, as in this case, excessive direct pressure from the splint must be avoided. Continuous pressure can lead to skin necrosis and subsequent healing disorders and infections.",

Physical examination shows a 3 × 3 cm area of induration that is fluctuant and warm to the touch, consistent with an abscess. The patient consents to incision and drainage of the abscess in the emergency department. Following evaluation of the patient's allergy status, a local anesthetic drug of the amide group with a particularly long duration of action is administered via subcutaneous infiltration. Which of the following local anesthetics was most likely administered?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Anesthetic choice depends on several factors, including the duration of action required for the procedure, patient allergies, and the need for hemostasis. Many institutions use the same local anesthetic for most procedures, regardless of the duration of analgesia. However, this question asks specifically for a local anesthetic of the amide group that provides the longest duration of analgesia.",

Bupivacaine is commonly used for local infiltration if prolonged anesthesia or extended pain relief is required. Epinephrine is frequently combined with local anesthetics to decrease bleeding associated with procedures and to increase the duration of action of anesthesia.",

He has been working as a mason for over 20 years. His father had similar symptoms and was treated surgically. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years and drinks 2–3 beers every day after work. His only medication is metformin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows skin puckering near the proximal flexor crease. There are several painless palmar nodules adjacent to the distal palmar crease. Active and passive extension of the 4^th and 5^th digits of the right hand is limited. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",

In Dupuytren contracture, overproliferation of fibroblasts and the formation of collagen nodules and cords lead to fibromatosis of the palmar fascia and restrict the extension of the affected digits (flexion contracture). The 4th and 5th digits are most commonly involved. Skin puckering near the proximal flexor crease and palmar nodules are the earliest characteristic signs. The diagnosis is usually clinical.\n\nConservative management (e.g., physiotherapy, hand splint) is indicated in early disease. Patients with rapidly progressing Dupuytren contracture may be treated with intralesional corticosteroids. Surgery is indicated in patients with functional disability.",

        "explanation_why": "Rupture of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon, also known as “jersey finger,” is a common sports injury and most commonly affects the right ring finger. The FDP, along with the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), is responsible for finger flexion. The tendons from the FDP muscle run through the carpal tunnel and insert on the palmar side of the distal phalanges of each finger, whereas the FDS tendons insert on the middle phalanx. This patient's inability to flex the DIP combined with the pain over the DIP joint, which is distal to the attachment of the FDS, indicate that he has ruptured his FDP tendon.",

Distal phalanx fracture is a common sports-related injury, but it would present with pain over the phalanx itself, rather than over one of the interphalangeal joints. While deformity of the distal phalanx and nail is common with distal phalanx fractures, a specific deficit in either flexion or extension over a particular joint would be less common.",

Rupture of the ED tendons leads to a pathology known as “mallet finger” or “baseball finger.” This injury often occurs when a ball hits the tip of the finger and hyperflexes the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). Patients with this injury would be unable to extend the DIP of the affected finger and would likely have more pain on the dorsal aspect of the finger over the DIP.",

She works as a hairdresser and has to take frequent breaks to rest her hand. Over the past 2 weeks, she has been taking ibuprofen as needed for the joint pain. Two weeks ago, she completed a course of oral antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. She has hypertension for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide. Her sister has systemic lupus erythematosus. She drinks one to two beers daily and occasionally more on weekends. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the right first carpometacarpal joint as well as the second and fourth distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender swellings are palpated over the second and fourth distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism for these findings?",

Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, it is assumed that excess deposition of glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid, and mucopolysaccharides in hypothyroidism causes myxedema. These characteristic deposits can cause compression of the carpal tunnel. Treatment with a thyroid hormone replacement (i.e., levothyroxine) should cause a return to a euthyroid state and improvement of symptoms within several weeks.",

Although patients with RA typically report joint pain (like the knee pain in this patient), the metacarpophalangeal, and proximal interphalangeal joints are more commonly involved.

The thenar part of the split transverse carpal ligament (blue overlay) and the median nerve (green overlay) are visible in the wound.\nNext to the median nerve, the median artery (red overlay) can be seen (this usually regresses before birth but may persist). Sources differ widely regarding the frequency of a persisting palmar median artery (1.5% to 50%), and it has been suggested that its presence may be associated with an increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.",

The friend reports that they were “pretty drunk” the previous night, and she had dropped her friend off at his home and driven off. When she came back in the morning, she found him passed out on the ground next to the doorstep. On arrival, he is conscious and cooperative. He reports feeling cold, with severe pain in his hands and face. He remembers having lost his gloves last night. His rectal temperature is 35.2°C (95.3°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased sensations over the distal fingers, which are cold to touch. The skin over the distal phalanges is cyanotic, hard, waxy, and tender, with surrounding edema. Laboratory studies are within the reference range. Chest x-ray and ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

This patient has cyanosis of the distal phalanges only, which will likely be treated with a soft-tissue amputation, or no amputation at all. A different step in management is more urgent at this time.",

        "explanation_why": "In patients with suspected frostbite, active rewarming of the affected extremity is indicated to avoid further tissue damage. The affected extremity should be immersed in a warm (preferably 37–39°C), circulating water bath. Passive rewarming is also helpful (especially in patients with mild hypothermia) and includes removing any wet clothes, covering with blankets, and increasing the temperature of the room.\n\nIn patients with concomitant moderate-to-severe hypothermia, treatment of hypothermia should take priority because it can be acutely life-threatening. The trunk should be warmed prior to the extremities, as peripheral vasodilation may lead to a return of cold blood to the heart, which increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.",

It is worse when she holds her 7-month-old son and improves with the use of an ice pack. Six months ago, she slipped on a wet floor and fell on her right outstretched hand. Her mother takes methotrexate for chronic joint pain. The patient takes ibuprofen as needed for her current symptoms. Examination of the right-hand shows tenderness over the radial styloid with swelling but no redness. There is no crepitus. Grasping her right thumb and exerting longitudinal traction toward the ulnar side elicits pain. Range of motion of the finger joints is normal. There is no swelling, redness, or tenderness of any other joints. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Diagnosis of this tendinopathy is established by the physical exam findings of pain over the radial styloid and a positive Finkelstein test.

However, tetanus immunoglobulin is only indicated if patients have had less than three tetanus toxoid doses. This patient received all childhood immunizations (which typically include three doses of the tetanus vaccine). Therefore, she does not require tetanus immunoglobulin.",

        "explanation_why": "Decreased grip strength with pain in the anatomical snuffbox suggests a scaphoid fracture, which is typically caused by falling onto an outstretched hand. The scaphoid bone, which is one of the carpal bones that forms the radiocarpal joint, receives its blood supply from an end artery that runs in a distal to proximal direction. A fracture of the scaphoid can damage this branch of the radial artery and cause avascular necrosis of the proximal segment. Avascular necrosis of the scaphoid increases the risk of osteoarthritis of the radiocarpal joint. The initial x-ray in the case of scaphoid fracture can be normal. Therefore, patients with a normal x-ray should be followed up with a repeat x-ray after approx. 2 weeks or an MRI if a scaphoid fracture is strongly suspected.",

There may, however, be significant variation, both in which radial branches are the principal contributors and in their branching patterns.\n\nBecause the arterial blood supply of the scaphoid flows from the distal pole to the proximal pole, more proximal scaphoid fractures are at higher risk of nonunion and avascular necrosis.",

Symptomatic cysts (e.g., due to weakness, paresthesia, pain) can be aspirated; however, 50% of ganglion cysts that are aspirated will most likely recur within a year. Surgery may be performed for patients who experience persistent or recurrent symptoms despite initial nonsurgical management, or who experience severe pain or significant limitation in daily activities.",

PG typically manifests as a painless, red papule or nodule and often develops at sites of skin injury on the face or hands, as seen here. The exact cause is unknown. Young men and pregnant women are commonly affected. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings but a histopathological confirmation can help to rule out malignant tumors. Surgical excision is the preferred method of treatment because it reduces the recurrence rate. Other methods of treatment include laser therapy, cryotherapy, intralesional steroid injections, and topical therapies (e.g., beta-blockers).",

She does not recall injuring her finger but the pain has become progressively worse and over the past 4 days, the painful area has become slightly swollen and red. She works as a bartender at a local bar. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms consistently. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 74/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 122/75 mm Hg. Examination of the right index finger shows an erythematous, swollen, and tender lateral nail fold; the nail plate and nail bed appear normal. When light pressure is applied to the volar aspect of the fingertip, a well-demarcated, fluctuating area of blanching appears in the lateral nail fold. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
