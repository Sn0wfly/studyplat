    "hint": "The absence of pulses in this patient indicates cardiac arrest. The presence of a sinus rhythm on the cardiac monitor suggests pulseless electrical activity (PEA).",

        "explanation_why": "Intravenous glucagon is recommended for patients with suspected beta blocker toxicity. Although this patient takes metoprolol and has some features of beta blocker toxicity (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia), the absence of PR interval prolongation is inconsistent with beta blocker toxicity. Other features, such as wheezing or seizures, are also not present. Regardless of the underlying etiology, she is currently in PEA arrest and requires a different emergent therapy.",

        "explanation_why": "The next best step for this patient in PEA arrest is administration of epinephrine (given as 1 mg IV, and repeated every 3–5 minutes while continuing CPR). PEA arrest is characterized by continued electrical activity within the cardiac conduction system (as seen in this patient with sinus rhythm on the cardiac monitor) but inadequate cardiac output to support tissue perfusion. For this reason, PEA arrest is considered a nonshockable rhythm. High-quality chest compressions and IV epinephrine are vital aspects of management.",

Patients with intra-abdominal hemorrhage may present with hypotension and tachycardia.

Patients with ARDS typically present with acute onset tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, dyspnea, diffuse crackles, and possibly fever, cough, and chest pain. Chest x-ray of patients with ARDS usually reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates, air bronchogram, atelectasis, and pleural effusions. This patient's x-ray indicates a pneumothorax, most likely due to increased pressures during mechanical ventilation. Increasing the PEEP is contraindicated as it would exacerbate his condition.",

        "explanation_why": "Insertion of a chest tube into the 4^th–5^th intercostal space between the anterior and midaxillary line (safe triangle) is the most appropriate next step for treating pneumothorax in a mechanically ventilated patient. Mechanical ventilation (especially with a high positive end-expiratory pressure) is considered a risk factor for developing pneumothorax. High ventilatory pressure can damage the lung tissue, causing a leak that allows air to enter the pleural cavity. Because the air entering the pleural space comes from the lung rather than the exterior, it is known as a closed pneumothorax. Following completion of the procedure, another chest x-ray to control the position of chest tube placement should be performed. To prevent further lung damage, the ventilatory pressure should be decreased.\n\nPneumothorax is often hard to diagnose in ventilated patients. Since the x-ray is obtained in the supine position, less air collects apically, making the pneumothorax less obvious.",

Such a pneumothorax usually resolves spontaneously within ∼ 10 days and symptomatic treatment and serial follow-up with repeat chest x-ray are sufficient.

He has had around 3–4 episodes of greenish-colored vomit during this period. He has major depressive disorder with psychosis. His mother has Graves disease. Current medications include sertraline and haloperidol. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 87/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. He is diagnosed with acute appendicitis and is taken to the operating room for an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. The appendix is gangrenous and perforated, and there is purulent fluid in the pelvis. Just after the appendiceal base is ligated, the patient develops muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 146/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The end-tidal CO_2 is markedly increased.

In patients with untreated hyperthyroidism, acute stress (e.g., infection or surgery) may precipitate a thyrotoxic crisis. In an anesthetized patient, thyrotoxic crisis manifests with fever, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and/or hypertension. Muscle rigidity, as seen here, is not a typical feature of a thyrotoxic crisis. In addition, this patient has no preoperative clinical features that suggest a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, despite the family history of Graves disease.",

        "explanation_why": "Dantrolene is the drug of choice to treat malignant hyperthermia because it prevents generalized muscle contraction by decreasing the concentration of calcium within the muscle cytoplasm. Physiologically, calcium induces contraction of muscle cells, and in the absence of intracellular calcium, muscle fibers cannot contract. An increase in end-tidal CO_2 is usually the earliest sign of malignant hyperthermia. It reflects increased production of CO_2 (due to accelerated aerobic metabolism) and, subsequently, serum lactate (as a result of the change in anaerobic metabolism), which together cause mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.\n\nManagement of patients with malignant hyperthermia includes immediate cessation of potential triggering agents (e.g, volatile anesthetics), hyperventilation with 100% O_2_, and cooling measures (e.g., ice packs, ice lavage). Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia can be determined by a caffeine halothane contracture test or genetic testing for mutations in the RYR1 and DHP genes.",

This patient is taking haloperidol, which may predispose him to develop NMS. While patients with NMS also develop fever, hypertension, tachycardia, and muscle rigidity, the onset of NMS is not hyperacute; instead, NMS evolves gradually over 1–3 days. In addition, it usually occurs within 2 weeks of initiating antipsychotic therapy or increasing dosage.",

Empiric antibiotic therapy in the case of appendicitis must also include coverage of anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides spp.), as they are a common pathogen in appendicitis. Ceftriaxone does not have anaerobic coverage, and vancomycin only covers gram-positive anaerobes. A different empiric antibiotic regimen with broad coverage including gram-negative anaerobes would be indicated in this patient (e.g., piperacillin and tazobactam).

This patient has no history of a recent medication change. The absence of other typical features of serotonin syndrome, such as clonus and mydriasis, as well as the marked increase in end-tidal CO_2 suggest a different diagnosis.",

These procedures include certain dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, routine dental cleaning), procedures of the respiratory tract that involve incision of the respiratory mucosa, and cardiac surgery with prosthetic material (e.g., prosthetic heart valves). The most commonly used antibiotic regimen is oral amoxicillin administered 30–60 minutes prior to a high-risk procedure. Alternatives to amoxicillin include intravenous ampicillin in patients unable to take oral medication and azithromycin in patients allergic to penicillin.",

She has right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration and has had a productive cough for the last 12 hours. She had an episode of hypotension after the operation that resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy 16 years ago for multiple fibroids of the uterus. She has hypertension and psoriasis. Prior to being admitted to the hospital, her medications included amlodipine and clobetasol ointment. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 17 years. She appears uncomfortable. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Inspiratory crackles are heard at the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a healing surgical incision below the right rib cage. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

        "explanation_why": "Incentive spirometry and deep breathing exercises can maintain and improve lung function after surgery by keeping alveoli open, thereby decreasing the risk of atelectasis and pneumonia. Although some studies have shown a limited effect, these measures are still recommended following thoracic and upper abdominal surgery because they are safe and cost-effective. Multiple factors increase the postoperative risk of pneumonia, such as restricted thoracic and abdominal movement due to pain and intubation-related changes in ventilation (e.g., mechanical compression, impaired surfactant functioning). Further strategies to promote lung expansion include early mobilization and adequate postoperative pain control.\n\nPreoperative measures to reduce pulmonary complications include smoking cessation (preferably ≥ 8 weeks before surgery), oral care (e.g., dental consult, improved oral hygiene), and treatment optimization for chronic lung diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).",

She has had previous episodes of abdominal pain that lasted for 10–15 minutes and resolved with antacids. She lives with her daughter and grandchildren. She divorced her husband last year. She is alert and oriented. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 134/min, and blood pressure is 101/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is rigid and diffusely tender. Guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Rectal examination shows a collapsed rectum. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun, and a CT scan of the abdomen shows intestinal perforation. The surgeon discusses the need for emergency exploratory laparotomy with the patient, and she agrees to it. Written informed consent is obtained. While in the holding area awaiting transport to the operating room, she calls for the surgeon and informs him that she no longer wants the surgery. He explains the risks of not performing the surgery to her, and she indicates that she understands and is adamant about not proceeding with surgery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Preoperative CST should be considered for a patient who has a high major adverse cardiac event risk and poor or unknown functional capacity. CST is performed using ECG or cardiac imaging (e.g., stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging). An exercise stress test can be performed if the patient is able to achieve ≥ 5 metabolic equivalents using the chosen exercise modality. For patients who are unable to do so, pharmacological stress testing (i.e., with adenosine, dipyridamole, regadenoson, or dobutamine) is the most appropriate option. If a stress test is abnormal, preoperative revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) can be considered to decrease the risk of major adverse cardiac events.",

It is also used to preoperatively evaluate patients undergoing nonthoracic procedures who have unexplained dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma) with significantly impaired airflow or abnormal baseline level of respiratory function. This patient will undergo intraabdominal rather than thoracic surgery. Additionally, as he last used his rescue inhaler 3 months ago and his lung examination was normal, his asthma is controlled and he has no evidence of significantly impaired airflow, making PFT unnecessary.",

Because of the potential negative outcomes associated with malnutrition, all preoperative patients should be screened for appropriate nutritional status. Malnourished patients should receive nutritional support, which may be delivered either enterally or parenterally. Enteral feeding helps preserve the normal physiology and immune function of the digestive system and therefore should be preferred over parenteral nutritional support whenever possible. Oral feeding is not contraindicated in this patient so he would benefit from high-protein oral nutritional supplementation, which is recommended for malnourished patients with malignancy or wounds.\n\nOther preoperative testing this patient may need includes a chest x-ray, since he is > 60 years of age, has a history of cardiac disease, and a recent history of significant cigarette use, as well as an ECG, because he is > 65 years old and has a history of ischemic heart disease.",

However, this patient's low albumin and protein suggest a different underlying cause of his weight loss. In addition, this patient does not have other symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia, heat intolerance, diarrhea, or increased appetite. Lastly, if there was a concern for hyperthyroidism, the first-line test to evaluate thyroid function would be measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone, not free T4 and total T3.",

However, pulse pressure is an indicator of stroke volume and not a direct indicator of end-organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation aims to achieve adequate end-organ perfusion, so a change in pulse pressure is not the best indicator to evaluate fluid resuscitation.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion and to restore intravascular volume. Since renal blood flow (and therefore GFR) is highly sensitive to changes in blood pressure and intravascular volume, urine output can serve as a surrogate measure to determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate. Ideally, urine output in adults should be greater than 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Therefore, a 70-kg man should have a urine output of 35–70 mL/hr. A urine output of 25mL in 3 hours suggests that his kidneys are not receiving adequate blood flow and therefore that he has not received adequate fluid resuscitation.\n\nWith adequate fluid resuscitation, an increase in some of the other indices, such as pulse pressure and Glasgow coma scale, might occur before a change in urine output is apparent. However, these parameters are not specific indicators of end-organ perfusion. Other parameters, such as lactate and a base deficit, are more useful for determining the prognosis than for guiding fluid therapy.",

However, serum lactate levels are not used to determine whether fluid resuscitation is inadequate because, even after adequate fluid resuscitation and correction of tissue hypoperfusion, lactate levels may not reach normal levels (< 2 mEq/L) for a few hours. Lactate clearance may take even longer in critically ill patients as a result of a prolonged lactate half-life (due to hepatic and/or renal dysfunction) and/or increased glycolysis.

He has acute myeloid leukemia and is currently receiving chemotherapy. On arrival, his temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 63/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Massive PE can cause major obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in increased right heart pressures and features of right heart failure, like jugular venous distension. Obstruction of the pulmonary vessels leads to a decreased right heart output, resulting in normal or mildly decreased PCWP and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which leads to decreased cardiac output and, consequently, obstructive shock. SVR increases to compensate for the decrease in cardiac output.",

Although RSI may be indicated in this patient prior to undergoing surgery, immediate RSI is not indicated as he is conscious, has a patent airway, and is not at impending risk of respiratory failure or aspiration.",

Although other lifesaving measures (i.e., fluid resuscitation) should also be conducted as soon as possible and might be done in parallel if more personnel were present, this physician is working alone. To prevent the patient from potentially bleeding to death, immediate transfer to an operating room is indicated. Establishing IV access and setting up fluids may be conducted after arranging transport or on the way to a trauma center. Once the patient is transferred, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed.",

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and the patient was temporarily catheterized for perioperative fluid balance. Several hours after the surgery, the patient began to have decreasing voiding volumes, nausea, and progressive, dull lower abdominal pain. Medical history is remarkable for Sjögren syndrome. He does not smoke and drinks one to two beers on the weekends. Current medications include pilocarpine eye drops. He appears uncomfortable and is diaphoretic. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows a pelvic mass extending to the umbilicus. It is dull on percussion and diffusely tender to palpation. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9000/mm^3, and platelet count is 230,000/mm^3. An attempt to recatheterize the patient transurethrally is unsuccessful. Which of the following is the most likely underlying condition?",

    "correct_answer": "A",

    "hint": "This patient has postoperative oliguria, lower abdominal pain, and a palpable pelvic mass that is dull on percussion, suggesting bladder distention. In combination, these findings indicate acute urinary retention (AUR).",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Several risk factors can contribute to postoperative AUR, including male sex, age > 50 years, joint arthroplasty, and preexisting urinary tract obstruction such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is the most common cause of bladder outflow obstruction and AUR in older men. An acute inability to micturate can be the initial presentation of BPH.\n\nSince transurethral catheterization was not successful, a suprapubic catheter should be placed for immediate relief of the distended bladder. Following this, the patient should undergo a trial of voiding without a catheter. Furthermore, the outflow obstruction should be evaluated with a uroflowmetry test to quantify the obstruction, and the suitability for treatment options, e.g., with alpha-1 blockers, should be discussed.",

        "explanation_why": "A number of drugs that act on the autonomic system can cause AUR by either decreasing detrusor activity (parasympatholytic agents) or increasing urethral sphincter tone (sympathomimetic agents). Pilocarpine is, however, a direct parasympathomimetic agent that would increase detrusor activity, which facilitates bladder emptying. This patient also takes pilocarpine intraocularly, which makes it highly unlikely that the systemic concentration of the drug would be high enough to have any effect on the bladder.",

While this patient's history of indwelling catheterization puts him at higher risk for urinary tract infections, acute bacterial prostatitis usually manifests with spiking fevers, chills, and perineal pain. The absence of fever and a normal leukocyte count make acute prostatitis unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "Urethral stricture is a possible cause of AUR. Iatrogenic manipulation (e.g., injury related to transurethral insertion of an oversized endoscope or catheter placement) is the most common etiology of urethral stricture. While this patient was catheterized transurethrally during surgery, it takes much longer than several hours for scar tissue of a urethral stricture to form. Recurrent urethritis may also cause urethral stricture. Because this patient has no history of previous surgeries requiring catheterization or recurrent urethral infections, urethral stricture is an unlikely diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) may manifest with AUR and is a common cause of bladder outflow obstruction, especially in young men and women. It results from injury to the central nervous system (e.g., multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke) or the peripheral nerves that supply the bladder (e.g., diabetic neuropathy). Postoperative NLUTD, however, is usually only seen following spinal anesthesia and abdominopelvic surgeries, either of which can cause neural damage resulting in impaired autonomic bladder control; NLUTD is highly unlikely to occur as a sequela of total knee replacement. In addition, an outflow obstruction due to NLUTD would be correctable with recatheterization, which was unsuccessful in this patient.",

Physical examination shows a 3 × 3 cm area of induration that is fluctuant and warm to the touch, consistent with an abscess. The patient consents to incision and drainage of the abscess in the emergency department. Following evaluation of the patient's allergy status, a local anesthetic drug of the amide group with a particularly long duration of action is administered via subcutaneous infiltration. Which of the following local anesthetics was most likely administered?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Anesthetic choice depends on several factors, including the duration of action required for the procedure, patient allergies, and the need for hemostasis. Many institutions use the same local anesthetic for most procedures, regardless of the duration of analgesia. However, this question asks specifically for a local anesthetic of the amide group that provides the longest duration of analgesia.",

Bupivacaine is commonly used for local infiltration if prolonged anesthesia or extended pain relief is required. Epinephrine is frequently combined with local anesthetics to decrease bleeding associated with procedures and to increase the duration of action of anesthesia.",

She feels well, but reports shortness of breath on mild exertion. She had a myocardial infarction 2 years ago and underwent placement of a stent in her left anterior descending artery. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, carvedilol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 81 kg (176.4 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Pulmonary examination shows scattered crackles bilaterally. There is jugular venous distension. Abdominal examination shows a large umbilical hernia; cough impulse is present. ECG shows sinus rhythm and 2 to 3 premature atrial contractions per minute. Chest x-ray shows widened intercostal spaces and mild cardiomegaly. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for perioperative cardiac complications in this patient?",

In pneumonia, ventilation decreases in the consolidated region of the lung due to alveolar inflammation (↓ V). In a lateral decubitus position, the dependent lung is better perfused (↑ Q) and ventilated than the nondependent regions. Placing this patient with left-sided pneumonia in the left lateral decubitus position will increase perfusion of the nonventilated alveoli, worsening the V/Q mismatch and increasing the A-a gradient.\n\nTherefore, in patients with unilateral pneumonia with hypoxia, positioning the body with the healthy lung in the dependent position (“good lung down”) improves arterial oxygenation by increasing both its ventilation and perfusion.",

The post-junctional membrane depolarization induced by succinylcholine results in efflux of K^+ from muscle cells. The risk of hyperkalemia is significantly increased when succinylcholine is administered to patients with other risk factors for hyperkalemia (e.g., burns, trauma, kidney failure). Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, such as rocuronium, are used to facilitate intubation under these circumstances to avoid hyperkalemia.",

Succinylcholine is typically rapidly metabolized and lasts < 10 minutes, so there is little risk of apnea. Some rare genetic mutations (e.g., congenital deficiency of plasma cholinesterase) can prolong succinylcholine's duration of action up to several hours.

The underlying pathophysiology is often complex but contributing factors may include high levels of catecholamines (endogenously due to the perioperative stress state; exogenous in the case of cardiovascular support), electrolyte or acid-base imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), reduced ventilation (leading to hypoxia and/or hypercarbia), and certain drugs. This patient takes a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), which is associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia. In cardiac cells, hypokalemia inhibits cardiac Na-K ATPase and causes prolonged ventricular repolarization, which predisposes to arrhythmias.\n\nMost patients with PVCs are asymptomatic and treatment (e.g., with antiarrhythmics or catheter ablation) is only required if PVCs are frequent or significantly symptomatic.",

Since his surgery, he has not had a bowel movement and is unable to pass flatus. He has no nausea or vomiting. Prior to the operation, the patient had daily bowel movements without abnormalities. He has a history of bipolar disorder and hypertension. His current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, chlorpromazine, amlodipine, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows a distended, tympanic abdomen with guarding and rebound tenderness; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Abdominal x-ray shows diffuse distention of the colon loops. A CT scan with contrast confirms the x-ray findings and shows a cecal dilation of 14 cm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management?",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "Abdominal distention and marked dilation of the colon and cecum on imaging indicate acute megacolon. This condition typically occurs as a complication of an interventional procedure and/or a side effect of medications that are known to decrease intestinal motility (e.g., amlodipine, chlorpromazine). The combination of fever, tachycardia, abdominal rebound tenderness, and guarding suggests a case complicated by peritonitis and actual or impending bowel ischemia.",

Because this patient presents with signs of bowel ischemia and peritonitis, he needs emergency surgical intervention to prevent further complications such as bowel necrosis, sepsis, shock. This patient will require a partial resection of the colon with primary anastomosis of the remaining ends of the colon or a (temporary) colostomy. Cecostomy tube placement would also be an option.",

The patient appears to be in moderate respiratory distress and is cradling his upper left arm in his right arm. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 25/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 108/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather face mask shows an oxygen saturation of 83%. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination shows multiple bruises on the left anterior thoracic wall. Jugular venous pulsation is measured at 3 cm above the sternal angle (8 cm H₂O) with the head of the bed elevated at 30 degrees. The trachea is at the midline. On inspiration, his left chest wall moves inwards while his right chest wall is expanding. There is pain to palpation and crepitus over his left anterior ribs. A CT scan confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

The flail segment further increases the work of breathing and restricts lung volume changes by moving in the direction opposite to thoracic wall movement. The initial management of a flail chest consists of adequate analgesia and supplemental oxygen therapy. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is indicated if the patient has evidence of respiratory failure. PPV directly assists with alveolar ventilation and gas exchange and may have an internal splinting effect on the flail segment. In patients who are alert and fully oriented, noninvasive PPV may be attempted, but this patient with an altered mental status also requires intubation for airway protection.\n\nIf the patient with a flail chest has a concomitant pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy should be performed before initiating PPV to prevent a simple pneumothorax from turning into a life-threatening tension pneumothorax.",

    "content_preview": "Two hours after undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, a 44-year-old man has nausea and pain at the site of surgery. He has vomited twice in the past hour. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include insulin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, acetaminophen, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. He drinks two to three beers daily and occasionally more on weekends. He is 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 130 kg (286 lb); BMI is 42 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 103/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg. Examination shows five laparoscopic incisions with no erythema or discharge.

        "explanation_why": "This patient underwent Roux-en-Y bypass, which puts him at risk of developing blind loop syndrome. However, blind loop syndrome is a long-term complication of gastric surgery and would not be expected to develop within 2 hours of surgery. Furthermore, it typically does not result in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Instead, patients may develop non-anion gap metabolic acidosis from chronic diarrhea and subsequent loss of bicarbonate.",

However, this patient does not have other typical features of DKA, such as hyperglycemia, ketonuria, polyuria, polydipsia, signs of volume depletion, neurological abnormalities, and a fruity breath odor. In addition, DKA is much more common in type 1 DM than in type 2 DM.",

        "explanation_why": "Alcohol withdrawal can result in metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap in malnourished patients with alcohol use disorder, especially those with a history of binge drinking. During alcohol ingestion, alcoholic carbohydrates are metabolized into energy, inhibiting fatty acid metabolism. However, as a response to alcohol withdrawal, there is a surge in catecholamines and cortisol which augments the metabolism of a fasting state. Consequently, lipolysis and ketone acid production are increased, resulting in metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap (alcoholic ketoacidosis). Although this man's alcohol consumption is borderline high, he does not have any other signs of alcohol withdrawal (e.g., tremors, altered mental state, or hallucinations), nor is he malnourished, making alcohol withdrawal an unlikely etiology of his acid-base disturbance.",

He has no history of serious illness and currently takes no medications. Despite appropriate safety precautions, he manages to leave the examination room unattended. Shortly afterward, he is found lying outside the emergency department. A visitor reports that she saw the patient climbing up the facade of the hospital building. He does not respond to questions but points to his head when asked about pain. His pulse is 131/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 105/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Physical examination shows a 1-cm head laceration and an open fracture of the right tibia. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Breath sounds are decreased over the right lung field, and the upper right hemithorax is hyperresonant to percussion. There is no jugular venous distension. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Drug-related fever can cause a broad range of symptoms, from isolated fever to allergic symptoms, such as urticaria, flushing, or pruritus. While this diagnosis cannot be entirely excluded, febrile drug reactions are more common in the subacute phase after surgery (> 1 week postoperatively). Also, the rapid onset of fever in this patient and the circumstances of her surgery suggest an alternative cause.",

When the child tried to pull himself up on the dresser, it tipped and fell on his chest and abdomen. He had been awake and agitated at the scene and moved all extremities except for his right arm. On arrival, he is unconscious with rapid, shallow respirations. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 164/min and thready, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 68/35 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bony deformity of the right upper extremity and scattered ecchymoses over the chest and abdomen. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities except for tachycardia. The abdomen is distended with guarding and rebound tenderness; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Attempts to obtain venous access were not successful. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

However, this patient presents with signs of severe hypovolemia requiring immediate fluid resuscitation. Subclavian vein cannulation performed during emergencies is accompanied by a variety of complications such as hemothorax or pneumothorax. In addition, CVL insertion requires ultrasound guidance, which would consume valuable time in an emergency such as this. Lastly, since flow rates in CVLs are relatively low given the length of the catheter, a CVL is not the preferred access for emergency fluid resuscitation.",

However, obtaining peripheral venous access has already been attempted without success and the patient requires immediate fluid resuscitation. Particularly in pediatric trauma patients such as this one, peripheral IV access should be achieved within 60–90 seconds of arrival.

Although endotracheal intubation would correct this patient's acute respiratory distress, it is not appropriate for long-term airway management (i.e., > 3 weeks), because of the associated risk of complications (e.g., tracheal stenosis, subglottic mass).

The postoperative period at that time was complicated by necrosis of the overlying skin. In the operating room, he is placed on continuous hemodynamic monitoring and anesthetized with intrathecal bupivacaine injected into the L3–L4 spinal interspace. Thirty minutes later, he has severe shortness of breath and lightheadedness and loses consciousness. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 38/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 82/50 mm Hg. Examination shows flushed skin. He withdraws the upper extremities to painful stimuli above the navel. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Local spinal anesthetics can interrupt the transmission of nerve impulses in spinal sympathetic pathways, causing a loss of sympathetic vascular tone that ultimately results in neurogenic shock. Neurogenic shock is a type of distributive shock characterized by generalized vasodilation (causing flushed skin). This vasodilation leads to decreased preload and subsequently reduced cardiac output, which results in severe hypotension. Bradycardia results from lack of beta-adrenergic activity and is exacerbated by unopposed parasympathetic tone (vagal tone). Consequently, cerebral perfusion is impaired, leading to loss of consciousness as seen in this patient. Treatment for neurogenic shock secondary to spinal anesthesia usually involves IV fluids and pressor therapy until the concentration of anesthetic agent has decreased adequately.\n\nSee “Overview of the types of shock” table.",

Also, he does not show signs of active infection such as fever or hypothermia, making septic shock unlikely. In addition, septic shock generally does not develop hyperacutely over the course of minutes as seen here.",

Enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it stimulates intestinal motility and prevents mucosal atrophy. As long as there is no facial trauma or basilar skull fractures, a nasogastric tube can be used for enteral feeding. When feeding, patients should have their backrest elevated to prevent aspiration and reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia.",

The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells during the surgery. During the first 24 hours following the procedure, he has only passed 200 mL of urine. He has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Current medications include atenolol, enalapril, and spironolactone. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes and flat neck veins. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 48 mg/dL. His serum creatinine and BUN on admission were 1.2 mg/dL and 18 mg/dL, respectively. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

Acute tubular necrosis (e.g., due to hypoxia) is the most common cause of AKI in the postoperative period. However, the BUN:creatinine ratio is decreased (≤ 15:1) in patients with intrinsic AKI because the renal damage causes decreased urea reabsorption. This patient's increased BUN:creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is more consistent with prerenal AKI, in which urea reabsorption is increased.",

The kidneys physiologically respond to hypoperfusion by reabsorbing large amounts of sodium, which is then followed by water. As a result, the excreted urine contains low amounts of sodium and is concentrated.\n\nIn intrinsic AKI (caused by direct kidney damage), the function of the tubular system is impaired, leading to reduced reabsorption of sodium and a urine sodium concentration > 40 mmol/L.",

However, signs of hypervolemia (e.g., edema), rather than hypovolemia (dry mucous membranes and flat neck veins in this patient), would be expected in intrinsic AKI, as the kidneys are unable to effectively remove excess fluid from the body.",

He also has tremors, diffuse sweating, headache, and nausea with dry heaves. Intraoperatively, there was approximately 100 mL of blood loss, his urine output was 100 mL, and 1 L of lactated Ringer solution was administered. His pain has been controlled with intravenous morphine. He was admitted to the hospital 3 days ago and has not eaten in 18 hours. He has no history of serious illness. He has experimented with intravenous illicit drugs. He drinks 3 beers and 2 glasses of whiskey daily during the week and more on the weekends with his college fraternity. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 142/90 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, but not to time or place, and keeps asking if his father, who is not present, can leave the room. Mucous membranes are moist and the skin is warm. Cardiac examination shows tachycardia and regular rhythm. The lungs are clear to auscultation. His abdomen has three port sites with clean and dry bandages. His hands tremble when his arms are extended with fingers spread apart. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "This patient has an excessive drinking pattern that was disrupted for the past 3 days because of admission to the hospital. He now has sympathetic overstimulation (anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and tremors), altered mental status, and visual hallucinations that are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal delirium, which typically occurs 72–96 hours after abrupt cessation of alcohol.",

However, the severity of tachycardia is far greater in thyroid storm (heart rate usually exceeds 140/minute) and severe hyperpyrexia (> 104°F) is also typically present. The lack of a history of hyperthyroidism also makes a thyroid storm unlikely.",

The abrupt cessation of a GABAergic agent (e.g., alcohol) in a patient with downregulated GABA receptors causes neuronal hyperexcitability, which is responsible for the manifestations of alcohol withdrawal, including alcohol withdrawal delirium. This condition may be lethal and must be treated urgently. The first-line therapy for alcohol withdrawal delirium is an intravenous benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam). Benzodiazepines are GABAergic agents and counteract neuronal hyperexcitability.",

Treatment consists of IV fluid resuscitation and small doses of epinephrine.",

            "description": "The injection site may be at any vertebral level (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar). This illustration shows a midline approach, but a paramedian approach is also possible.(1) Local anesthetic is infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue (1a) and interspinous ligament (1b).\n(2) The epidural needle is inserted, angled slightly cephalad with the bevel orientated cephalad. Once the needle has been advanced by about 2–3 cm into the interspinous ligament, the stylet is removed and a loss-of-resistance syringe filled with saline is attached.\n(3) The needle is advanced while applying constant, gentle pressure on the syringe plunger. After passing through the ligamentum flavum and entering the epidural space, a sudden loss of resistance is felt and the saline is more easily injected (3a); at this point, advancement is stopped.\n(4) The syringe is removed and the epidural catheter is inserted through the needle to its correct depth (puncture depth + 4–6 cm). The tip of the catheter must always be advanced cephalad (4a); therefore, the bevel of the needle must remain facing cephalad.\n(5) The epidural needle is removed, taking care to maintain the epidural catheter at the correct depth. At this time, aspiration is attempted from the catheter (5a: this should return neither blood nor CSF), and an epidural filter is attached (5b).\n(6) The puncture site is covered with a transparent dressing and the catheter is secured to the patient's back with adherent dressings. A test dose is then administered.",

        "explanation_why": "Aortocaval compression can cause supine hypotensive syndrome, a condition in which maternal vessels are compressed by the uterus when the mother is lying in a supine position. The resulting impaired blood supply can lead to maternal hypotension and fetal hypoxemia with bradycardia. While supine hypotensive syndrome should always be considered in hypotensive pregnant women, the normal fetal heart rate makes this diagnosis unlikely.",

The pain began yesterday and radiates to the neck and shoulder area. She also has nausea and has had one episode of clear vomitus. The symptoms are exacerbated when she gets up from bed, and they have not improved despite starting acetaminophen and bed rest one day prior. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated and the patient attended all prenatal health visits. She underwent epidural analgesia for delivery. Her postpartum course was free of obstetric complications. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 81/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg. She is alert and oriented. On examination, neck stiffness is present. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The surgical course was uncomplicated, and the patient was successfully extubated before arrival to the unit. He received 0.5 L of lactated Ringer solution intraoperatively. The patient was given morphine and ketorolac for postoperative pain. A similar episode happened 6 months ago when the patient took aspirin for a headache; symptoms resolved spontaneously within 3 hours. He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, and hypertension. His daily medications include metoprolol and lisinopril. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen by face mask shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Wheezing is heard in both lungs. Breath sounds are decreased. The patient's face appears flushed. Watery nasal secretions and conjunctival injection are present. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

However, metoprolol is a beta-blocker that selectively inhibits β_1 receptors. It is therefore not the most likely cause of bronchospasm in this patient.\n\nAll beta-blockers can trigger bronchospasms in patients with asthma and β1-receptor selectivity is diminished in higher doses. Therefore, beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with severe or decompensated asthma. However, therapeutic doses of cardioselective beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) are generally well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate asthma.",

Alveolar rupture would result in a pneumothorax, which presents with dyspnea and decreased breath sounds on the side of the pneumothorax.

Patients with AERD develop symptoms resembling those of a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., wheezing, decreased breath sounds, facial flushing) following the administration of aspirin or NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac). Watery rhinorrhea and conjunctival injection are also commonly seen in AERD. Unlike a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is an IgE-mediated process, AERD is a pseudoallergic reaction caused by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Inhibition of the COX pathway increases the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes via the lipoxygenases pathway. Leukotrienes cause flushing and bronchial inflammation.",

    "question_text": "A 46-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after a bicycle accident during which she fell on her head and right shoulder. On arrival, she is awake and alert. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus and panic attacks. She has a history of alcohol use disorder but says that she has not had an alcoholic drink for 1 month. On examination, there is a hematoma on her left temple and her right shoulder joint appears dislocated. Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right shoulder confirms uncomplicated dislocation. The patient receives intravenous midazolam and fentanyl as procedural sedation for closed shoulder reduction. Following the procedure, the patient remains sedated for a prolonged time and the physician decides to reverse sedation pharmacologically. After administration of naloxone and flumazenil, the patient develops a tonic-clonic seizure lasting for one minute. Her pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient appears drowsy and diaphoretic. Examination shows a tremor in both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's seizure?",

After administration of naloxone and flumazenil, the patient develops a tonic-clonic seizure lasting for one minute. Her pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient appears drowsy and diaphoretic. Examination shows a tremor in both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's seizure?",

This patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for which she may be taking insulin or noninsulin antidiabetic drugs (e.g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides) that increase her risk of hypoglycemia.

        "explanation_why": "Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that can cause acute benzodiazepine withdrawal and may precipitate seizures in patients with high tolerance from chronic use. Therefore, indications for flumazenil are narrow, such as the treatment of oversedation and/or overdose in benzodiazepine-naive patients. This patient has a history of panic attacks, for which she is likely taking benzodiazepines. Her seizure following flumazenil administration was likely caused by withdrawal.\n\nSevere respiratory depression from isolated benzodiazepine poisoning is very rare and usually only occurs with coingestion of alcohol, opioids, barbiturates, first-generation antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), and other respiratory or CNS depressants. Expectant management and supportive care are sufficient for most patients with isolated benzodiazepine overdose. Patients undergoing flumazenil therapy require careful monitoring by a specialist.",

Prolonged respiratory depression can lead to anoxic brain injury manifesting with seizures. However, anoxic or hypoxic brain injury from prolonged respiratory depression is typically delayed (∼24 hours) rather than immediate.

He has no history of skin infections but has type 2 diabetes mellitus and has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Three days after admission, he becomes increasingly hypoxic and tachypneic. He is emergently intubated and ventilatory support is initiated. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m^2. His pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 95/60 mmHg. The ventilator is set at a tidal volume of 540 mL, respiratory rate of 20/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H_2O. On pulmonary examination, there are diffuse crackles. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Hemoglobin concentration is 11.5 g/dL, serum lactate is 4.0 mmol/L, and serum creatinine is 2.5 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas checked 30 minutes after intubation shows a PCO_2 of 50 mm Hg and a PO_2 of 55 mm Hg on an F_IO_2 of 1.0. An x-ray of the chest shows new bilateral infiltrates. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to improve tissue oxygen delivery in this patient?",

This presentation is concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially in the setting of his ongoing infection (wet gangrene). His P_aO_2/F_iO_2 ratio is less than 100, which categorizes his ARDS as severe and carries a high mortality risk.",

However, the high peak pressures and lung distention associated with high tidal volumes in patients with ARDS increase the risk of barotrauma and worsening respiratory distress. Using lower tidal volumes (lung protective ventilation of ∼ 6 mL/kg) improves mortality risk in patients with ARDS, and mild hypercapnia is tolerated in this regard (permissive hypercapnia).",

        "explanation_why": "ARDS is a syndrome with complex pathophysiology characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, leading to pulmonary edema, alveolar collapse, and impairment in gas exchange. Increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) will help distend the alveoli (thereby increasing alveolar ventilation as well as decreasing the work of breathing) and increase oxygen diffusion into the pulmonary capillaries. Patients with severe ARDS often require higher levels of PEEP to help recruit alveoli and improve gas exchange. Since this patient is already at maximum F_iO_2 and is on appropriate lung-protective ventilation settings (tidal volume of 6 mL/kg), increasing PEEP would be the most appropriate next step in management.",

The administration of intravenous crystalloid fluids (lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline) is the best next step in the management of a catheterized patient with postoperative oliguria and azotemia because increasing intravascular fluid volume via a fluid challenge will increase renal perfusion and thereby reverse these processes.\n\nIf the urine output does not increase after adequate fluid resuscitation, or if azotemia persists or worsens, a different cause of acute kidney injury (e.g., acute tubular necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, ongoing fluid losses, or, less likely, abdominal compartment syndrome) should be considered.",

However, the absence of tachycardia and/or hypotension makes intraabdominal hemorrhage very unlikely. An abdominal CT would also be indicated if a deep surgical site infection (e.g., bacterial peritonitis, intraabdominal abscess) or anastomotic leak were suspected.

His wife reports that he drank 1 bottle of vodka over the past 24 hours. During this time, he has had nausea but no bloody or tarry stool, and no abdominal pain. There is no history of similar episodes. The patient takes no medications. On arrival, he is awake but confused. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 110/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows ascites. On mental status examination, he is not oriented to person, place, or time. During the examination, the patient has another episode of vomiting blood. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.5 g/dL. Two large intravenous catheters are placed, and administration of intravenous fluids is begun. When vital signs are measured again, his pulse is 94/min and blood pressure is 109/80 mm Hg. He does not respond to verbal commands but withdraws appropriately to painful stimuli. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) for NGT lavage was formerly used to help determine whether the bleeding originated from the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract and whether it was ongoing. However, NGT placement is no longer recommended in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding because it has limited diagnostic and therapeutic value, causes significant discomfort, and carries the risk of complications (e.g., aspiration and airway compromise). Furthermore, this patient's ongoing bright red hematemesis suggests ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so NGT placement would provide no additional information. Additionally, patients with suspected esophageal variceal bleeding should not undergo NGT placement, which may exacerbate bleeding and further damage the esophagus.",

Endotracheal intubation decreases the risk of aspiration and can facilitate upper endoscopy in order to confirm the diagnosis and perform the definitive treatment (e.g., variceal band ligation).\n\nIn alcoholic cirrhosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding raises suspicion for an esophageal variceal hemorrhage. A Mallory-Weiss tear is also an important differential diagnosis in this patient, as it is not known whether the hematemesis was preceded by emesis, retching, and coughing.",

Patients with ongoing hematemesis should not receive anything by mouth, particularly if they also have altered mental status. PPIs should be administered intravenously to avoid further risking aspiration. The cause of this patient's hematemesis is still unclear, so empiric treatment with a PPI is an important part of initial management, although it is not the next best step for this patient.",

            "description": "A flow-volume loop is most commonly used as a graphical representation of spirometry testing. It plots inspiratory and expiratory flow (y-axis) against lung volume (x-axis) during a maximal forced expiration and a maximal inspiration.A (normal): At the beginning of the test, the patient has inhaled to total lung capacity of approx. 6.25 L (normal adult range: 6–6.5 L), and there is no flow. As the patient forcefully exhales, the flow quickly reaches a peak at approx. 10 L/s (normal adult range: 6–12.5 L/s) and then declines almost linearly until flow is zero at the residual volume of just over 1 L (normal adult range: 1–1.5 L). The patient then takes a full inspiration to return to total lung capacity.B (acute asthma): Expiratory flow is impaired by narrowed airways. Therefore, the peak expiratory flow rate is lower than normal with a slightly concave (scooped) curve toward the residual volume. The residual volume is abnormally elevated, as the narrowed airways have prevented a full expiration.C (emphysema): Expiratory flow is obstructed by the collapse of small airways. Therefore, the peak expiratory flow rate is lower than normal with a concave (scooped) curve toward the residual volume. The residual volume and total lung capacity are abnormally elevated due to the lung's increased compliance, decreased recoil, and air trapping.D (fixed upper airway obstruction): Expiratory and inspiratory flows are flattened and reduced, as they are impeded by the fixed obstruction.E (unilateral mainstem obstruction): The shape of the loop is normal, but peak expiratory and inspiratory flow rates are reduced, as air can only enter the open portion of the lung. The residual volume is greater than normal because air in the obstructed airway cannot be fully exhaled.F (obesity): Expiratory and inspiratory flows and total lung capacity are slightly reduced (compared to diagram A) because of the mechanical limitation of the obese chest wall to expand to full capacity.G (neuromuscular weakness): Respiratory muscle weakness results in reduced expiratory and inspiratory flows, reduced total lung capacity, and increased residual volume.H (fibrosis): Total lung capacity and peak expiratory and inspiratory flows are substantially decreased due to the lung's decreased compliance. Note that due to the enhanced elastic recoil of fibrotic lung parenchyma, expiratory flow is not decreased as greatly as lung volume.",

The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender and the uterus is soft. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 g/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?",

Stress cardiomyopathy can manifest with symptoms of cardiac failure, including hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

        "explanation_why": "Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare, life-threatening complication of childbirth in which amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation. AFE typically manifests during or shortly after labor or vaginal/cesarean delivery with abrupt onset of severe respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological compromise. Most patients progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation, which manifests with severe bleeding (e.g., from intravenous lines) and multiorgan dysfunction. AFE is mainly a clinical diagnosis. Treatment is supportive and involves respiratory and hemodynamic support, including the transfusion of blood products, to ensure adequate oxygenation and perfusion for both the mother and fetus. Up to 50% of patients with AFE die within an hour of onset.\n\nThe exact pathophysiology of AFE is not fully understood but likely involves an immune response (e.g., mast cell degranulation, complement system activation to fetal antigens that enter the maternal circulation). Risk factors for AFE include multiparity, age > 35 years, and complicated labor (e.g., placenta previa/abruption, forceps delivery, eclampsia).",

    "content_preview": "A 72-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of upper abdominal pain, nausea, and nonbloody vomiting for the past hour. The patient rates the pain as an 8 to 9 on a 10-point scale. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and osteoporosis. The patient has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years. She drinks 5–6 alcoholic beverages daily. Current medications include glyburide, lisinopril, and oral vitamin D supplements. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 138/86 mm Hg.

With PCAs, patients press a button that releases additional intravenous medication, allowing them to control the amount of analgesic they receive and minimizing the risk of underdosing. The pumps include a lockout period during which no further analgesic can be administered in order to avoid inappropriately high doses and reduce the risk of respiratory depression. Although opioids are known to cause sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, there is no evidence showing that opioids aggravate pancreatitis or worsen clinical outcomes.",

Absent or decreased breath sounds on the left suggest inadvertent right mainstem bronchus intubation, which is more common than inadvertent left mainstem bronchus intubation because the right mainstem bronchus is more vertically oriented than the left mainstem bronchus at the bifurcation of the trachea. When this is suspected, the appropriate next step is to pull back the ETT to the correct placement in the trachea, approx. 2–6 cm above the carina (or at the level of the T2–T4 vertebra on a chest x-ray). Methods of confirming the correct placement of an ETT include chest x-ray, end tidal CO_2 measurement via capnography, and epigastric auscultation (gurgling suggests that ETT is in the GI tract).",

            "description": "Approx. half of cases of malignant hyperthermia are associated with a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR-1). RyR-1 is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Physiologically, activated RyR-1 in the skeletal muscle interacts with the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), which results in calcium release from the SR into the sarcoplasm.(1) If a mutation in the RyR-1 is present, certain triggering substances may lead to a pathological stimulation of the receptor, which (2) results in uncontrolled opening and excessive release of calcium from the SR. The contractility of the skeletal muscle increases, which in return increases the metabolism. As the increased oxygen need can no longer be met, the cell's energy supply breaks down and the cell dies.(3) The first-line treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, which interacts with RyR1 and prevents the release of calcium from the SR of the skeletal muscle.The mechanism shown here is simplified; research on the pathomechanism of the condition and the exact effect of dantrolene is ongoing.",

Cirrhosis is caused by chronic damage to the liver parenchyma and manifests with impaired liver function, which can cause decreased production of coagulation factors. As a result, patients can develop a bleeding diathesis (e.g., blood oozing around IV sites, prolonged PT and PTT). However, cirrhosis typically also causes other manifestations, such as jaundice, asterixis, spider angiomata, and ascites.

        "explanation_why": "These serum findings are most consistent with DIC as evidenced by increased prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and D-dimer. DIC is a disorder characterized by systemic activation of the clotting cascade with microthrombi formation, which results in the exhaustion of all clotting factors. Microthrombi precipitate microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which results in schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. The depletion of clotting factors prolongs the PT and PTT. Fibrinogen is activated in the clotting cascade to become fibrin; thus, a decrease in fibrinogen is expected in patients with DIC.",

Liver biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis but typically shows massive centrilobular hepatic necrosis.\n\nHalothane is not commonly used as an anesthetic in the United States (and most other industrialized countries) because of its side effects. Instead, it has been replaced with other inhalational anesthetics, such as desflurane, sevoflurane, or isoflurane.

        "explanation_why": "Excessive bleeding in an otherwise healthy young male who easily bruises, with a probable family history of the disease in a maternal uncle and isolated PTT elevation is highly suspicious for hemophilia. Because hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, it affects males almost exclusively, and ⅔ of patients have a positive family history in a maternal male relative. The history of easy bruising and joint swelling (likely hemarthrosis) in his maternal uncle is characteristic of hemophilia. Inherited hemophilias cause isolated factor VIII, IX, or XI deficiency (all part of the intrinsic coagulation pathway), presenting with isolated PTT (which measures intrinsic pathway function) elevation on lab workup.\n\nBecause of his highly suggestive family history, the next best step for this patient is to acquire clotting factor activity levels to confirm the diagnosis. For patients with less suggestive histories, a mixing study would be the most appropriate next step. Hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B; hemophilia C is the rarest type of hemophilia.",

Patients with AERD develop symptoms resembling those of a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., wheezing, decreased breath sounds, facial flushing) following the administration of aspirin or NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac). Watery rhinorrhea and conjunctival injection are also commonly seen in AERD. Unlike a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is an IgE-mediated process, AERD is a pseudoallergic reaction caused by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Inhibition of the COX pathway increases the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes via the lipoxygenases pathway. Leukotrienes cause cutaneous flushing and bronchial inflammation.",

However, metoprolol is a beta blocker that selectively inhibits β_1 receptors. It is therefore not the most likely cause of bronchospasm in this patient.",
        "explanation_but": "All beta blockers can trigger bronchospasms in patients with asthma and β1-receptor selectivity is diminished in higher doses. Therefore, beta blockers should be avoided in patients with severe or decompensated asthma. However, therapeutic doses of cardioselective beta blockers are generally well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate asthma.",

Unlike other non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, which undergo hepatic or renal metabolism, atracurium is degraded predominantly by enzymatic hydrolysis (70%) and by Hofmann elimination (30%). In patients who have impaired renal or hepatic function, atracurium is the preferred agent for muscle relaxation because it acts for a predictable duration of time, and because atracurium doesn't rely on normal renal or hepatic function to be metabolized.",

He is mechanically ventilated with supplemental oxygen. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Examination shows reduced breath sounds and absent tactile fremitus over the left hemithorax. An x-ray of the chest shows loss of lung volume, a moderate mediastinal shift to the left, and a wedge-shaped opacity in the left lower lobe. Positive end-expiratory pressure is increased to 8 cm H_2O. Three days later, an x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. Which of the following best explains this patient's pulmonary findings?",

However, chest x-ray would not show a wedge-shaped opacity, as seen here, but rather reduced or absent lung markings beyond a pleural line.

His improvement, as visualized by the normal chest x-ray days after increasing PEEP, further supports this diagnosis. Postoperative pain can interfere with spontaneous deep breathing and coughing, which can lead to hypoxemia and airway collapse. Further, airway obstruction (due to retained pulmonary secretions) leads to resorption of gas by pulmonary capillaries, which can cause the collapse of nonventilated alveoli distal to the bronchial occlusion (i.e., resorptive atelectasis). However, increased positive pressure can reopen the collapsed alveoli by stenting open the airways, providing the lung expansion that the patient is unable to achieve by themself. Patients who smoke and/or have COPD, like this patient, are particularly at risk for postoperative atelectasis. Preoperative smoking cessation and medical optimization are key to prevention.\n\nOther types of atelectasis include nonobstructive and rounded.",

Immediately after being knocked over, he had pain in his right lower thoracic region. Twenty minutes later, he became dizzy. His wife says he has no history of previous illness and takes no medications. On arrival, he barely responds to painful stimuli. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 76/62 mm Hg. No source of bleeding is seen besides small lacerations on his extremities. There is a significant ecchymosis in the right lower thoracic region and the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Chest auscultation shows no abnormalities. Peripheral venous access is established, blood samples for crossmatching and blood gas analysis are drawn, and rapid infusion of Ringer lactate (RL) solution is initiated. The patient is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. A FAST scan of the abdomen discloses blood in the hepatorenal recess. After the administration of 1000 mL of RL solution, the patient's blood pressure is 80/64 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The bleeding most likely comes from liver laceration caused by a rib fracture (as suggested by ecchymosis on the right lower chest). The next step in management should increase blood pressure and ensure oxygen delivery to the tissue.",

If available, fully crossmatched pRBCs are preferable for this purpose. Early resuscitation with blood reestablishes hemoglobin levels and, therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the intravascular volume. The reestablished capacity prevents organ ischemia and associated metabolic acidosis, both of which can complicate shock. If hemorrhage is extensive and the patient continues to be hemodynamically unstable, plasma and platelets should be transfused in addition to pRBCs at a 1:1:1 ratio. Transfusion of these blood products counters the risk of developing coagulopathy, which is another complication of shock associated with acidosis, hypothermia, trauma itself, fibrinolysis, and dilution due to fluid transfusion. In addition to transfusion of pRBCs, management of this patient should include immediate transfer to the operating room for laparotomy.",

While fever due to an infectious origin can also lead to postoperative fever, it rarely occurs before the third day after surgery. Other noninfectious causes of immediate postoperative fever, such as febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and malignant hyperthermia, are unlikely here because the patient is hemodynamically stable and has isolated fever and chills.\n\nIn patients who continue to have fever due to a suspected infection or who are hemodynamically unstable, management includes broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, discontinuation of offending medications, and removal of catheters (intravascular or urinary).

She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Preadmission medications include candesartan, salmeterol, budesonide, and pravastatin. Upon admission, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated because she was unconscious. Over the past 12 hours, her end-expiratory airway pressure was increased to ensure adequate oxygenation. Her current temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 114/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 140/92 mm Hg. An x-ray of the chest shows new alveolar infiltrates and air bronchograms in the right lower lobe. Which of the following measures is most likely to have prevented this patient's current condition?",

Therefore, a change in the ventilator circuit is recommended if it is visibly soiled, malfunctioning, or if a new patient is ventilated. However, frequent changes of the ventilator circuit for the same patient increase rather than decrease the risk of VAP because manipulation of the ventilator circuit increases the risk of microaspiration of subglottic secretions.",

        "explanation_why": "Sedatives are used in mechanically ventilated patients to relieve discomfort and anxiety and, if a spontaneous ventilatory mode is unavailable, to prevent complications arising from patient-ventilator asynchrony. However, excessive sedation impairs the patient's airway protective reflexes and allows oropharyngeal secretions or gastric reflux to pass beyond the glottis. In intubated patients, these collections can pool in the subglottic region and drain around the endotracheal tube cuff, as microaspirates, into the lower respiratory tract. Using sedation assessment tools and daily titration of the patient's depth of sedation to the minimum necessary level (sedation vacation) can prevent the subglottic pooling of secretions and subsequent VAP. Sedation vacations also prevent VAP by facilitating spontaneous breathing trials and early ventilator weaning.\n\nVAP can also be prevented by measures that decrease oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal bacterial colonization (e.g., oral chlorhexidine rinses, avoiding unnecessary acid suppression therapy), decrease subglottic pooling (e.g., oropharyngeal and subglottic suctioning, semirecumbent positioning of the patient), and decrease the risk of microaspiration (e.g., minimizing patient transport, avoiding frequent ventilator circuit changes for the same patient).",

Duplex ultrasonography and CT angiography of the carotid arteries had shown an 80% stenosis on the right and 50% stenosis on the left. A shared decision to perform right-sided carotid endarterectomy was made with consent from the patient's medical power of attorney, and the management plan was documented in the patient records as “CEA right.” The surgical intern meets the patient on the ward on the day of surgery and, using a permanent marker, circles the surgical site and marks “X” on the nonsurgical site. The patient is brought to the operating room and the circulating nurse confirms that all relevant patient documents and findings are available. While the surgical team is scrubbing, the anesthetist asks the patient to verify her surgery site by pointing to it. Regional anesthesia is performed, and the patient is draped. The surgery is subsequently performed without any complications. While filling out the signout checklist after the surgery, the circulating nurse notices that the surgery was performed on the left carotid artery instead of the right. Which of the following actions would most likely have prevented this never event?",

    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "The Universal Protocol should be followed to prevent never events such as wrong-site surgery. This protocol consists of a series of steps based on the human factors engineering strategy of redundancy and standardization and should be performed before invasive medical procedures. In this scenario, the surgeon did not follow the protocol for one of these steps correctly and a subsequent step was missed entirely. If this subsequent step had been performed, it could have reduced the likelihood of the error occurring by acting as an additional safety measure (i.e., a Swiss cheese model).",

Marking may be performed by the attending surgeon after verbal confirmation from the patient, although it is acceptable to delegate to another person who will also be present during the procedure (e.g., the surgical intern in this scenario), or by the patient directly in front of the surgeon, but the site marking protocol should be standardized for each institution.",

        "explanation_why": "The Universal Protocol is a three-step process:\n\n1. preprocedural verification of the patient's identity, the surgical site, and the surgical procedure;\n2. surgical site marking;\n3. performing a time-out.\n\nA surgical time-out is performed in the operating room prior to the procedure to reconfirm the patient's identity, the procedure, and the surgical site. The time-out is typically initiated by a designated member of the team, such as the circulating nurse, and involves all of the team members (e.g., operating room technicians, principal surgeon, medical students) who are participating in the procedure. The whole team is responsible for reviewing all of the relevant information through active communication, and once everyone is in agreement, the time-out should be documented. A successful time-out requires a safety culture, which provides an environment in which health care providers can actively speak up about potential errors.\n\nThe protocol for surgical site marking was also not followed correctly in this scenario. When marking the surgical site, the correct site should be marked by writing the word “YES”, the surgeon's initials, or both using an indelible marker. The incorrect surgical site should not be marked; this includes marking with the word “NO” or an ambiguous visual cue (e.g., an “X” could also be interpreted as an indicator of the correct site).",

Therefore, adhesive tape is not recommended because it can easily be rubbed off or transferred to a different site, which can result in wrong-site surgery.",

He was diagnosed with a left direct inguinal hernia 4 months ago and requested a day-care surgery because he does not wish to stay in the hospital longer than is necessary. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. The on-call anesthetist completed his preoperative assessment on the day of admission and cleared the patient for surgery. On the day of the surgery, the anesthesiology resident, who is part of the team performing the procedure, reviews the patient's records, determines that the patient needs echocardiography, and informs the surgical resident responsible for the patient's care. The surgical resident believes that the patient does not require any further preoperative cardiac evaluation and that performing the evaluation would necessitate postponing the surgery to the next day. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the surgical resident to the request for preoperative echocardiography?",

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The anesthetist and surgeon work in a team but they have different processes, priorities, and knowledge based on their training. These differences can lead to interpersonal disagreement/conflict. There are five common strategies for dealing with disagreement/conflict: forcing (competing), accommodating, avoiding, compromising, and collaborating. In health care, collaboration should be used whenever possible.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "This response is an example of collaboration (conflict management strategy). The surgeon's genuine inquiry about the anesthetist's reasoning allows an open discussion about the necessity of preoperative echocardiography and potential alternative courses of action. In collaborative negotiations, the participants should explore each other's thought processes (appreciative inquiry) and aim to understand their own interests regarding the issue (self-reflection). The collaboration strategy, which aims to solve problems in everyone's best interest (including the patient's), helps to maintain a good relationship between the conflicting parties and promotes mutual understanding, respect, and trust. A downside of this approach is that it is time-consuming and requires more effort and commitment, which may be impractical in emergency situations.",

Forcing may be appropriate when a quick solution to a problem is essential (e.g., life-threatening situation) or when all other methods are exhausted. This strategy should not be the surgeon's initial approach to this conflict because it might provoke similarly competitive behavior in the anesthetist, which will require more energy from both parties.

Accommodating may be appropriate when an issue is less important to the accommodating party, when maintaining harmony is more important than achieving a personal goal, when one party accepts that their position is wrong, or when continuing the conflict is unlikely to lead to a positive outcome. Though accommodating can reduce conflict and stress, this strategy should not be the surgeon's initial approach because it creates a win/lose relationship and may lead to feelings of resentment by the “losing” party. Simply giving in may also put the surgical resident in a position in which they can be taken advantage of in the future.

Avoidance may be appropriate when there is no time to deal with a conflict, when others can handle the conflict better, when the issue is not worth the effort of an argument, and/or when the other party is exhibiting hostile behavior. Though avoidance allows the surgeon to deflect conflict and stress, this strategy should not be the initial approach because it will likely damage the relationship between the residents and may lead to future conflicts. Moreover, by simply passing on the conflict to the attending, the surgeon weakens themself and denies responsibility for the patient. Involving third parties is helpful if two parties are not able to solve conflicts among themselves. However, in such cases, it is appropriate to involve a neutral third party rather than a negotiator who stands on the same side as one of the conflicting parties.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Preoperative patient evaluation and management, which includes medication adjustment, play an important role in the prevention of perioperative complications such as hypoglycemia, hypotension, and hemorrhage. Metformin, which increases the risk of renal hypoperfusion and intraoperative lactic acidosis, should be discontinued on the day of surgery. Aspirin is typically discontinued for 7–10 days before procedures with a high bleeding risk (e.g., craniotomy, spinal surgery), but it is continued for most other procedures. Recommendations vary on discontinuing ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and ARBs. Some guidelines recommend continuing therapy, while recent evidence suggests holding ACEIs 24 hours before surgery unless the patient has a history of heart failure or severe hypertension. Beta blockers such as bisoprolol should be continued. Statin therapy and topical steroid cream may be continued because both carry minimal perioperative risk. Important lifestyle modifications for the prevention of postoperative complications include smoking cessation for at least 8 weeks prior to surgery and complete fasting from at least 2 hours before surgery.\n\nSee “Perioperative medication management” table.",

This patient is undergoing spinal surgery, for which routine preoperative CPET is not indicated. His exercise tolerance (walks 4 miles without developing fatigue or dyspnea) and normal findings on chest x-ray and pulmonary function testing make additional functional testing unnecessary.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "A churning sound in the precordial region (also known as the mill-wheel murmur) is consistent with air in the heart chambers. This finding is characteristic of venous air embolism. Other common features of this condition include sudden hypotension, tachycardia, jugular vein distension, signs of respiratory distress, and, in patients who are being mechanically ventilated, a sudden fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Venous air embolism develops when air enters the venous circulation. This can occur during neurosurgical procedures, especially those that require the patient to be in a sitting position. In this position, the negative (subatmospheric) pressure of the cranial veins due to them being at a higher level than the heart can result in air being sucked into the cranial veins. Other causes of venous air embolism include vascular interventions (e.g., insertion or removal of central venous catheters), penetrating lung injuries, and barotrauma. Management procedures depend on the suspected site of embolism and include compression of the suspected entry site, correction of hypoxia and hypotension, and placing the patient in a head-down position (e.g., Trendelenburg position) or in the left lateral decubitus position (Durant maneuver), both of which help trap the air emboli in the right ventricular apex and therefore prevent further obstruction of the pulmonary outflow tract. If the patient remains unstable following these procedures, direct aspiration of air through a central venous catheter may be considered.",

However, patients with hemorrhagic shock have flat rather than distended jugular veins due to the underlying decrease in central venous pressure.

        "explanation_why": "Drugs that are commonly required during surgery should be prepared beforehand and should always be readily available. Involving the on-site pharmacist is a key step to prevent drug dispensing errors. If multiple patients receive doses from the same vial (as seen in multidose vials), drug dispensing for the operating room should take place in a clean area reserved for medication preparation (e.g., a satellite pharmacy) and in an aseptic manner (e.g., using sterile syringes, disinfecting the septum before piercing the vial). Preparing drug trays with prefilled syringes in conjunction with clear labeling (e.g., with the drug's generic name and drug concentration) using standardized printed labels maximizes patient safety by reducing the risk of product mix-ups and dispensing errors. The label may also include the date, time, pharmacist's name, and the patient's name and date of birth.",

Therefore, there would be an increased risk of attentional capture and skill-based errors if the anesthesiologist was responsible for drawing up drugs during surgery.

Consequently, most DNR orders cannot be maintained in the operative setting. When a patient with a DNR order requires a surgical procedure, the most appropriate step is to complete a procedure-specific DNR. Historically, DNR orders have been automatically suspended during procedures, but this practice limits patients’ autonomy by assuming knowledge of what they want. Currently, a process called “required reconsideration” in which the patient or surrogate, the surgeon, and the anesthesiologist revisit the DNR order for the perioperative setting during the informed consent process. Older children and adolescents should be included in discussions about their DNR orders and assent to DNR decisions to the extent that they are developmentally capable of doing so. Together, these individuals should discuss overall patient care goals and specific potential interventions that may be required. They should also define when the perioperative period officially ends and the preceding DNR order goes back into effect.",
