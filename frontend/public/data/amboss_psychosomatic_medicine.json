    "question_text": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, bloating, and loose stools with mucus lasting several days to a couple of weeks. She has had these episodes since she was 24 years old but they have worsened over the last 6 weeks. The site of the abdominal pain and the intensity of pain vary. She has around 3–4 bowel movements per day during these episodes. Menses are regular at 31-day intervals with moderate flow; she has moderate pain in her lower abdomen during menstruation. She moved from a different city 2 months ago to start a new demanding job. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her own medications include multivitamins and occasionally naproxen for pain. Temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 110/82 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin\n14.1 g/dL\n\nLeukocyte count\n8100/mm^3\n\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n15 mm/h\n\nSerum\n\n Glucose\n96 mg/dL\n\n Creatinine\n1.1 mg/dL\n\n IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody\nnegative\n\nUrinalysis shows no abnormalities. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following in this patient?",

    "hint": "The combination of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain with varying location and intensity that are exacerbated by emotional stress, altered bowel habits (change in stool frequency and form), and normal physical examination and laboratory studies (e.g., hemoglobin, ESR) are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is most commonly seen in individuals aged 20–39 years.",

        "explanation_why": "Cutaneous flushing can be caused by carcinoids. These neuroendocrine tumors are usually asymptomatic, as the hormones that they produce (e.g., serotonin) are cleared from circulation by the liver. If they metastasize beyond the liver, however, they can cause symptoms such as diarrhea and cutaneous flushing. This patient is unlikely to have a metastasized carcinoid because of the chronic duration of her symptoms, which do not include further expected signs such as dyspnea and wheezing.",

However, this patient does not have further findings associated with celiac disease (e.g., anemia, steatorrhea, positive IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody test), PUD (e.g., dyspepsia, anemia, pain typically worsened by eating), or IBD (e.g., elevated ESR, extraintestinal manifestations).",

        "explanation_why": "Black, tarry stools (i.e., melena) are most commonly caused by upper gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., variceal hemorrhage due to cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease), which can manifest with abdominal pain. Other possible causes include right-sided colorectal cancer. This patient does not have features of cirrhosis (e.g., jaundice, ascites), peptic ulcer disease (e.g., epigastric tenderness, dyspepsia), or right-sided colorectal cancer (e.g., anemia, B symptoms).",

Although colorectal cancer can manifest with abdominal pain and loose stools, other findings such as unexplained weight loss or iron deficiency anemia are usually also present. Moreover, colorectal cancer is uncommon in younger patients who do not have a positive family history. If this patient had hemorrhoids, other characteristic findings such as anal pruritus and pain during defecation would be expected. Furthermore, none of these conditions explain this patient's chronic course of symptoms.",

        "explanation_why": "Relief of abdominal pain after defecation is often seen in patients with IBS, which is a common chronic gastrointestinal disease with an unknown underlying pathophysiology. In some patients, pain may increase upon defecation or remain unchanged. In the absence of red flag symptoms (e.g., nighttime pain, blood in the stool, weight loss, fever), diagnosis of IBS is based on the Rome IV criteria. Treatment includes regular consultations and reassurance that the disease, although chronic, is benign; dietary adjustments (e.g., avoidance of gas‑producing foods); physical activity; stress management; and possibly psychological therapy.\n\nIn patients with suspected IBS and the predominant symptom of diarrhea, additional testing should be considered, e.g., fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin, stool antigen test for Giardia lamblia, serological celiac disease testing, and CRP levels.",

He describes the pain as a sharp, substernal chest pain that radiates to the right shoulder; he says “Please help me. I'm having a heart attack.” He has been admitted to the hospital twice over the past week for evaluation of shortness of breath and abdominal pain but left the hospital the following day on both occasions. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol but is a known user of intravenous heroin. He has been living in a homeless shelter for the past 2 weeks after being evicted from his apartment for failure to pay rent. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The patient seems anxious and refuses a physical examination of his chest. His cardiac troponin I concentration is 0.01 ng/mL. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes. While the physician is planning to discharge the patient, the patient reports numbness in his arm and insists on being admitted to the ward. On the following day, the patient leaves the hospital without informing the physician or the nursing staff. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He was sweating profusely during the episode and did not lose consciousness. He remembers having felt a chill down his spine before the episode. Following the episode, he experienced weakness in the right arm and was not able to lift it above his head for 2 hours. Three weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved with over-the-counter medication. He was born at term and his mother remembers him having an episode of jerky movements when he had a high-grade fever as a toddler. There is no family history of serious illness, although his father passed away in a motor vehicle accident approximately 1 year ago. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 94/54 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, electrolytes, calcium, and creatinine are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The rapid, irregular, and nonstereotyped movements of Sydenham chorea are usually generalized (involving the head, neck, and limbs) and continuous while the patient is awake, worsening over hours to days. Motor symptoms may be associated with impaired motor control, muscle weakness, and/or hypotonia. While the patient's history of a sore throat 3 weeks ago should raise suspicion of rheumatic fever, the timing of the appearance of the motor disturbance (< 1 month after sore throat), the cessation of the movement after 2 minutes, its restriction to a single limb, and the lack of other criteria suggestive of rheumatic fever make the diagnosis of Sydenham chorea unlikely.",

        "explanation_why": "A migraine may be accompanied by an aura of both positive and negative focal neurologic symptoms such as visual disturbances, paresthesias, or pareses, which usually develop gradually (> 5 minutes) but last no longer than 1 hour and are by definition completely reversible. Hemiplegic migraines specifically are defined by the presence of motor weakness as the manifestation of the aura. Migraines may also be preceded by prodromes occurring 24–48 hours prior to the beginning of the headache, which may include complex experiential symptoms such as depression and euphoria. While this patient did experience a feeling of a “chill down his spine” prior to the episode and subsequent reversible paresis of his arm, he did not experience the headache that is central to the diagnosis of migraine with aura, nor the associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia. Moreover, the timing of the prodrome and the development and duration of his paresis are not consistent with a migraine aura.\n\nSome patients with migraines may experience aura without an associated headache, also known as a silent migraine, migraine equivalent, or acephalgic migraine. However, this is relatively uncommon, and the majority of patients with hemiplegic migraine have headache with each attack.",

Focal seizures may arise in the setting of hippocampal sclerosis, infection, trauma, or perinatal injury, among others. The majority of affected patients also experience an aura, with higher cortical sensations such as déjà vu and fear that precede the focal seizure. This patient experienced violent, jerky arm movements preceded by a “chill down his spine” and followed by temporary focal paresis without residual effects (Todd paralysis) upon presentation to the emergency department, which is consistent with the diagnosis of a focal seizure without impairment of consciousness, previously referred to as a simple partial seizure.",

Since then, she has been staying up late at night working on an art project. She is enrolled in community college and has been able to complete her daily schoolwork and look after her younger brother at home without issues. She feels rested despite sleeping less than 4 hours per night. Her parents also report that she seems easily distracted and more talkative than usual. She has never had similar symptoms before. In the past, she has had episodes where she felt too tired to go to school and slept until 2 PM every day for 2 weeks at a time. During those episodes, her parents noticed that she cried excessively, was very indecisive, and expressed feelings of worthlessness. She has a history of asthma controlled with inhaled albuterol as needed. Two months ago, she developed a mild exacerbation that was managed with inhaled albuterol and oral prednisone. She tried cocaine once in high school but has not used it since. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is irritable but cooperative. When asked how she feels, the patient says, “I feel great. I'm not sure why I even need to see a doctor.” Her speech is pressured, and her thought process is linear. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The distinction between hypomania and mania depends on the intensity and duration of manic symptoms. Hypomania is characterized by manic symptoms (e.g., irritable mood, goal-directed behavior, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and increased talkativeness in this patient) for ≥ 4 days without significant functional impairment. This patient's hypomania in combination with past major depressive episodes (i.e., excessive fatigue, depressed mood, indecisiveness, and feelings of worthlessness that lasted ≥ 2 weeks) fulfill the criteria for bipolar II disorder.",

        "description": "MRI brain (T1-weighted; axial plane)There is marked dilatation of the lateral ventricles (green overlay) with mild sulcal enlargement (red overlay). The findings are suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus as opposed to age-related or neurodegenerative cerebral atrophy.Periventricular hypointensities (examples indicated by white arrowheads) are also seen and may reflect transependymal edema due to elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure.",

She says that she has been gradually sleeping less over the past couple of months. It takes her 20–25 minutes to fall asleep each night, and she wakes up earlier in the morning than she used to. On average, she sleeps 5–6 hours each night. She says that she has also been waking up several times per night and needs about 20 minutes to fall asleep again. She feels mildly tired in the afternoon but does not take any naps. Her husband reports that she does not snore. She takes a 45-minute walk with her husband and their dog every other day. The patient drinks two cups of coffee each morning. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 55 kg (121 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she appears cooperative with a full range of affect. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

However, flurazepam and other long-acting benzodiazepines are on the Beers list of medication that is potentially inappropriate for patients > 65 years of age due to an increased risk of delirium, falls, and motor vehicle crashes.

In theory, melatonin should decrease sleep latency, but studies have shown its effect size to be small and potentially clinically insignificant. Furthermore, this patient's sleep latency is within the standard deviation of normal (i.e. < 30 minutes), and it is unclear how much benefit she would receive. A trial of melatonin could be indicated if sleep latency onset increased in this patient.",

Changes include increased sleep latency, longer light stages of sleep with increasing frequency of nighttime awakenings, decreased time in the deep sleep phase (stage 3), shorter REM phases, as well as earlier bedtimes and morning awakenings, all of which can make individuals feel more tired. While such changes may indicate disorders (e.g., advanced sleep phase disorder) and merit treatment, this patient is most likely experiencing normal changes in sleep that occur with aging.",

However, most patients become tolerant to this side effect over the course of a few days. Furthermore, diphenhydramine is on the Beers list of medication that is potentially inappropriate for patients > 65 years of age due to its anticholinergic effects that can precipitate delirium, constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention.

While most complications of anorexia nervosa can be dealt with in an outpatient setting, this patient's bradycardia (heart rate < 40 bpm) is an indication for hospitalization to prevent syncope, heart failure, and sudden cardiac arrest or death. Bradycardia is a compensatory response to caloric deprivation and generally resolves once the patient's weight is restored by refeeding.\n\nOther criteria for hospitalization include cardiac dysfunction, weight < 70% of ideal body weight or BMI < 15 kg/m^2, and acute medical complications of malnutrition such as syncope, seizures, liver failure, pancreatitis, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte disturbances.",

Since he was promoted to a manager in a large software company 6 months ago, he has had several episodes of these symptoms when he has to give presentations in front of a large group of people. During these episodes, his thoughts start racing and he fears that his face will “turn red” and everyone will laugh at him. He has tried to avoid the presentations but fears that he might lose his job if he continues to do so. He is healthy except for mild persistent asthma. He frequently smokes marijuana to calm his nerves. He does not drink alcohol. His only medication is an albuterol inhaler. His pulse is 78/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the patient appears calm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

CBT includes psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and exposure practices to address the anxiety, physiologic responses, and avoidance behaviors. Additionally, beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) or benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam) can be taken 30–60 minutes before an anxiety-inducing event. In this patient, beta-blockers are contraindicated due to his asthma as beta-blockers can cause bronchospasm. Benzodiazepines should also be avoided as marijuana use can exacerbate the adverse effects of benzodiazepines.",

Since the death of her husband one year ago, she has been living with her son and his wife. She is worried and feels guilty because she does not want to impose on them. She has stopped going to meetings at the senior center because she no longer enjoys them and because she feels uncomfortable asking her son to give her a ride, especially since he has been under a great deal of stress lately. She is 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 51 kg (110 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is tired and has a flattened affect. Cognition is intact. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

    "question_text": "A 22-year-old college student comes to the physician because of depressed mood and fatigue for the past 5 weeks. He has been feeling sad and unmotivated to attend his college classes. He finds it particularly difficult to get out of bed in the morning. He has difficulty concentrating during lectures and often feels that he is less intelligent compared to his classmates. In elementary school, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and treated with methylphenidate; he stopped taking this medication 4 years ago because his symptoms had improved during high school. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 8 years; he feels guilty that he has been unable to quit despite numerous attempts. During his last attempt 3 weeks ago, he experienced increased appetite and subsequently gained 3 kg (6 lb 10 oz) in a week. Mental status examination shows psychomotor retardation and restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    "hint": "This patient presents with depressed mood, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feelings of guilt, and psychomotor retardation for a period > 2 weeks, which is consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD). The sudden weight gain is most likely attributable to his attempt to quit smoking. This patient will benefit most from a medication that can address both MDD and smoking cessation.",

Moreover, amitriptyline has a sedative effect, which is not helpful in this case, as the patient is already suffering from fatigue. Furthermore, this medication does not aid in smoking cessation.",

In patients who are unable to set a quit date, medication preloading with varenicline (i.e., pharmacotherapy while the patient is still smoking) reduces smoking in the weeks leading up to the quit date and increases the likelihood of sustained abstinence rates in the future. In addition to being a safe drug for smoking cessation, varenicline is slightly more effective than bupropion, an alternative management option. A combination of pharmacological and behavioral intervention leads to better results for patients who wish to quit smoking.",

Three weeks ago, her boyfriend of 4 years left her. She has no appetite and has had a 2.3-kg (5.1-lb) weight loss. She has missed several classes because she could not get out of bed or stop crying. She thinks about her ex-boyfriend all of the time. She says that she experienced similar symptoms for about 2 months after previous relationships ended. The patient is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (100 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 36.1°C (97°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she appears sad and cries easily. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

She has been evaluated in the emergency department twice during these episodes; both times her ECG showed normal sinus rhythm and serum cardiac enzymes and thyroid hormone levels were normal. She does not currently have symptoms but is concerned that the episodes could occur again at any time and that there may be something wrong with her heart. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urine toxicology screening is negative.

    "question_text": "A previously healthy 36-year-old man is brought to the physician by a friend because of fatigue and a depressed mood since his wife left him 4 weeks ago. Since then, the patient has stopped participating in weekly bowling nights with his friends and also missed his friend's bachelor party. He spends his evenings alone at home watching television on the couch. The patient's friend is concerned that he may lose his job because he feels “tired of everything all the time, including work.” He has not missed any work days and has been able to meet all important deadlines. Nearly every night, he wakes up frequently and sometimes takes 20 minutes to go back to sleep. The patient says that he avoids bowling nights because he does not want to see his wife's mutual friends. He also says that he felt too depressed for the bachelor party, which “just did not feel like the right thing at this point in time.” He says that he needs some time to himself in the evening and enjoys watching TV, especially a recent documentary on wildlife in Wyoming. He says that he is planning a trip there to stay alone in a cabin and have some time to think. His vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person, place, and time. He has a flat affect and says that he is going through a difficult phase and does not know how to live without his wife.

    "content_preview": "A previously healthy 36-year-old man is brought to the physician by a friend because of fatigue and a depressed mood since his wife left him 4 weeks ago. Since then, the patient has stopped participating in weekly bowling nights with his friends and also missed his friend's bachelor party. He spends his evenings alone at home watching television on the couch. The patient's friend is concerned that he may lose his job because he feels “tired of everything all the time, including work.” He has not missed any work days and has been able to meet all important deadlines. Nearly every night, he wakes up frequently and sometimes takes 20 minutes to go back to sleep. The patient says that he avoids bowling nights because he does not want to see his wife's mutual friends. He also says that he felt too depressed for the bachelor party, which “just did not feel like the right thing at this point in time.” He says that he needs some time to himself in the evening and enjoys watching TV, especially a recent documentary on wildlife in Wyoming. He says that he is planning a trip there to stay alone in a cabin and have some time to think. His vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person, place, and time. He has a flat affect and says that he is going through a difficult phase and does not know how to live without his wife. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

This condition is diagnosed in patients with inappropriate or maladaptive emotional or behavioral changes in response to a psychosocial stressor when full criteria for other psychiatric conditions (e.g, major depressive episode) are not met. The goals of cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with adjustment disorder are to identify the stressor, develop methods for reducing stress, and learn coping skills. Pharmacotherapy is usually not required but may be used when psychotherapy alone has little or no effect.",

She also has abdominal bloating and constipation that started 2 weeks ago. She has had no pain with defecation or change in stool form or appearance. She is upset because she has seen two other physicians who performed tests but were unable to make a diagnosis. The patient is currently on sick leave but would like to return to work as soon as possible. She often worries about having a gastric ulcer that may perforate and insists on getting an endoscopy. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She reports that she is under significant pressure from her managers because of frequent performance evaluations. She has a history of childhood asthma. She takes multivitamins and glucosamine daily to prevent arthritis. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The abdomen is mildly distended and slightly tender. The remainder of the examination, including a neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Fecal occult blood test and urea breath test are negative. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Somatic symptom disorder manifests with one or more physical symptoms that cause significant distress and/or interfere with daily functioning, typically lasting > 6 months. The diagnostic criteria include at least one of the following: disproportionate thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviors concerning one's health, excessive anxiety about illness, and inordinate time or resources spent on health concerns. Incidence of somatic symptom disorder is higher in women and in those with a history of chronic childhood illness (e.g., asthma). After ruling out any treatable medical conditions, management consists of reducing unnecessary tests and procedures by scheduling regular appointments and establishing a therapeutic alliance with a single primary care physician. Psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) may be helpful to treat any underlying psychological causes (e.g., stress) and comorbid psychiatric conditions.",

        "explanation_why": "Individuals with factitious disorder typically have a history of seeking care from multiple providers and significant exposure to a healthcare environment (e.g., because of childhood illness) and are willing to undergo invasive treatments. Factitious disorder is characterized by the intentional falsification of an illness and/or its symptoms (e.g., factitious hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin use) in order to assume the sick role. There is no evidence of deceptive or attention-seeking behavior by this patient, and her symptoms appear to be genuine.",

Her symptoms started after she was fired yesterday from her job of 20 years. She says she feels sad and does not understand what she will do with her life now. She uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma, and recently started oral isotretinoin for acne. She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but for the last year, she has decreased to two cigarettes daily. She appears sad and upset. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She maintains eye contact and follows instructions. She denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He wakes up frequently during the night from vivid dreams of this incident. He blames himself for being unable to save his friend. He also has trouble falling asleep and gets up earlier than desired. During this period, he has started to avoid walking in deserted streets. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

However, there is a high potential for addiction to benzodiazepines, especially in patients with PTSD. Benzodiazepines may also cause mental clouding and interfere with cognitive behavioral therapy.

However, a common side effect of triazolam is vivid dreams and nightmares. This patient already has vivid dreams of the traumatic incident, and triazolam could worsen his symptoms.

Since this patient has vivid dreams of the traumatic incident on a regular basis, difficulty falling asleep, and poor sleep quality despite using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a trial of prazosin would be indicated.\n\nIdeally, PTSD is treated with a combination of trauma-focused psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.

    "question_text": "A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department with his wife because of a 3-day history of severe pain in his right arm. He also reports that he cannot move his right arm. The symptoms began after the patient woke up one morning, having slept on his side. He is otherwise healthy. He works as a waiter and says that he feels exhausted from working several night shifts per week. He adds that he “can barely keep his eyes open” when looking after their daughter the next day. Since the onset of the pain, he has been unable to work and is fully dependent on his wife, who took on an extra shift to make enough money to pay their monthly bills. The patient appears relaxed but only allows himself to be examined after his wife convinces him. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows 1/5 muscle strength in the right arm. Reflexes are normal. He has no sensation to light touch over the entire right arm and forearm. When a pinprick test is conducted, the patient rapidly withdraws the right arm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This patient reports paralysis and pain in his right arm, but clinical findings are inconsistent with his statements and indicate that movement is preserved. The fact that he is reluctant to undergo examination should raise concern that an external reward is at stake (e.g., time off from work and potentially obtaining insurance money).",

In brachial neuritis, however, shoulder pain and neurological deficits do not occur simultaneously; neurological deficits only occur as the pain begins to subside. Moreover, this patient does not have a true neurological deficit because the deep tendon reflexes, pain sensation, and withdrawal reflex are intact.",

In malingering, patients intentionally feign symptoms of a physical or psychiatric illness to obtain an external benefit (e.g., time off from work, financial compensation, avoiding jail). These individuals are also typically uncooperative during physical examination. Malingering is not a mental disorder.\n\nPatients with malingering should be approached in a nonthreatening, calm, distant yet empathetic manner to improve the physician-patient relationship and give the patient the opportunity to be honest without becoming uncomfortable and possibly compromising this relationship.",

However, there is no external motive for feigning symptoms and individuals usually have a history of an underlying depressive or anxiety disorder.

Severe shoulder pain, weakness of both flexors and extensors in the arm, and sensory loss on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of both the arm and forearm are not consistent with radial nerve palsy.

The girlfriend reports that, over the past 3 months, the patient has become withdrawn and stopped pursuing hobbies that he used to enjoy. Around that time, he started to become apprehensive about leaving his apartment and began to express suspicions that the FBI was trying to control his mind. One month ago, he lost his job because he stopped going to work to avoid being spied on. He used to smoke cannabis occasionally in high school but quit 5 years ago. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is confused and suspicious with marked psychomotor agitation. His speech is disorganized and his affect is labile. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question_text": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon.” Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

However, a key component of schizoid personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of social withdrawal and limited range of emotional expression. Patients are content with social isolation and do not seek relationships. Although this patient does not have friends and spends most of his time alone, patients with schizoid personality disorder would be more indifferent about social interactions than anxious. Furthermore, this patient's interest in paranormal phenomena, magical thinking, and eccentric clothing would not be explained by this diagnosis.",

Although this young man is uncomfortable around other people, his age and the absence of additional symptoms of ASD, including impaired language skills or repetitive movements and behavior, makes the diagnosis unlikely. The diagnosis of ASD would also not explain this patient's preoccupation with paranormal phenomena.",

However, a key component of paranoid personality disorder is suspicion of and distrust toward others due to the belief that others have malicious intentions.

Furthermore, paranoid personality disorder is not typically associated with odd and magical thinking.",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with schizophrenia present with chronic and recurrent psychosis for more than 6 months. These patients tend to initially present with a prodrome of negative symptoms characterized by social withdrawal, which is then followed by positive psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucinations, delusions, and bizarre behaviors). Although this patient prefers to be alone and has odd beliefs, he does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, as he has no clear delusions or hallucinations and no disorganized speech.\n\nThis patient's laborious speech is not the same as disorganized speech. Laborious speech is nonfluent speech that requires excessive effort and lacks spontaneity, but the thought processes and the contents of the speech are intact. On the other hand, disorganized speech results from disorganized thought processes and can manifest as loose associations (illogical, sudden, and frequent changes of topic), word salad (sequence of words without a logical connection), and flight of ideas (quick succession of thoughts), none of which are evident in this patient.",

Cognitive behavioral therapy can further help patients to understand and manage their symptoms.

    "question_text": "A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after being found in a confused state at a rest area along an interstate highway in Florida. She is unable to recall her name, address, or any other information regarding her person. She denies being the woman on the Connecticut driver's license found in her wallet.  A telephone call with the police department of her hometown reveals that she had been reported missing three days ago by her husband. When the husband arrives, he reports that his wife has had a great deal of stress at work lately and that before she went missing, she was anxious about telling her boss that she will not meet the deadline for her current project. She has had two major depressive episodes within the past 4 years that were treated with citalopram. She drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is oriented only to time and place but not to person. Short-term memory is intact; she does not recognize her husband or recall important life events. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's inability to recall autobiographical information after a stressful event at work raises suspicion for dissociative amnesia. Since this patient's episode of dissociative amnesia involved traveling away from her usual surroundings, the specifier “dissociative fugue” applies. The diagnosis is further supported by the significant social impairment associated with her symptoms and the absence of a physiological (e.g., traumatic brain injury, transient global amnesia), psychiatric (e.g., dissociative identity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder), or substance-related (e.g., alcohol use disorder, medication adverse effects) cause for her presentation.",

Wandering or purposeful travel of which the patient has no recollection is a possible feature of dissociative identity disorder that is seen in this patient. The diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of at least two distinct personality states that cause identity disruption and dominate at different times. As there are no signs of this in this patient at this point, dissociative personality disorder would not be the right diagnosis.",

His wife says that he has seemed sad and irritable for the past 4 months. He lost his job as a store clerk 1 year ago because he often lied to avoid work, and spent most of his days on the phone placing bets on football games. He avoids all family-related events because he has borrowed money from most of his relatives. He is hopeful that his symptoms will improve once he is able to win some of his money back. He previously smoked 8–10 cigarettes daily but quit 1 month ago. He drinks beer on the weekends. On examination, he is uncooperative and dismissive. He is mildly tremulous. Neurologic examination is normal. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Her teachers describe her behavior as uncooperative and disruptive as she persistently refuses to answer questions, insults her teachers, and deliberately distracts her classmates. At home, her parents try to address her frequent violations of curfew but attempts to discuss the issue often result in their daughter losing her temper and screaming at her parents. Her grades have deteriorated over the past year. When listening to music or hanging out with friends, she is calm and pleasant. She has no history of psychiatric illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is uncooperative and frequently disrupts the physician’s conversation with the parents. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "explanation_why": "Patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often described as “uncooperative” and “disruptive” by their teachers because they have difficulty remaining seated, quietly engaging in activities, and not interrupting other students in their activities. Difficulties sustaining attention can lead to an increased rate of mistakes and a deterioration of academic performance. However, unlike this child who defiantly refuses to answer questions, children with ADHD have difficulties controlling their impulse to talk and tend to answer out of turn. Moreover, temper tantrums and insulting behavior are not typical features of ADHD and the diagnosis of the condition can only be made if the onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 12 years.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's irritable mood, deliberately annoying peers, and defiant behavior toward authority figures without serious violation of social norms are consistent with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). The frequency of this behavior, more than once per week, goes beyond what is normative for children of her age. Furthermore, the ≥ 6-month duration of symptoms fulfills the diagnostic criteria for ODD.\n\nIndividuals with ODD are negatively impacted in numerous areas important for normal functioning (e.g., social, educational, occupational), and the hostility they express is toward individuals within their immediate social circle (e.g., family members, peers, work colleagues, teachers). Therefore, peer group support and peer-mediated interventions, alongside psychotherapy, parent management training, and social-skills programs, are pivotal in treating ODD.",

The parents report that their son woke up suddenly screaming, crying, and aggressively kicking his legs around both times. The episodes lasted several minutes and were accompanied by sweating and fast breathing. The parents state that they were unable to stop the episodes and that their son simply went back to sleep when the episodes were over. The patient cannot recall any details of these incidents. He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

It also typically involves sympathetic hyperactivity (mydriasis, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea), unresponsiveness to efforts at calming, and no recollection of the event on waking. The condition is usually self-limited. Sharp/potentially harmful objects should be kept away from the bedroom of the patient. Benzodiazepines may be helpful in refractory cases.",

This condition is associated with obstructive sleep apnea, and the patient often cannot remember the episode once fully awake. Also, it is difficult to wake up a patient during an episode. However, patients with sleepwalking disorder often have a blank stare during the episode of incomplete arousal from sleepwalking and are not agitated/distressed.

He recently quit the school's football team after missing many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church.

The mother reports that over the past 6 months, her daughter has had frequent mood swings. Sometimes, she is irritable for several days and loses her temper easily. In between these episodes, she behaves normally, spends time with her friends, and participates in gymnastics training twice a week. Her mother has also noticed that her daughter needs more time than usual to get ready for school. Sometimes, she puts on an excessive amount of make-up. One month ago, her teacher informed the parents that their daughter had skipped school and was seen at the local mall with one of her classmates instead. The patient reports that she often feels tired, especially when she has to wake up early for school. On the weekends, she sleeps until 1 pm. Menses have occurred at 15- to 45-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years; they are not associated with abdominal discomfort or functional impairment. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's behavior?",

Irritability (e.g., losing one's temper), mood swings, hypersomnia, fatigue, and infrequently skipping school, all of which are seen in this 13-year-old adolescent, are considered normal as long as they do not cause significant distress or functional impairment.",

Her teachers complain that she does not answer their questions and it is affecting her academic performance. She was born at 35 weeks' gestation and pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia. Previous well-child examinations have been normal. Her older brother was diagnosed with a learning disability 4 years ago. She is at 65^th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. She follows commands. She avoids answering questions directly and instead whispers her answers to her mother, who then mediates between the doctor and her daughter. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Her medical records indicate that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia 2 years ago and treated with olanzapine; she has not filled any prescriptions over the past 4 months. Three weeks ago, she stopped going to work because she “did not feel like getting up” in the morning. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination of the right wrist shows no visible injury; there is no warmth, swelling, or erythema. Range of motion is limited by pain. On mental status examination, she has a flat affect. Her speech is pressured and she frequently changes the topic. She has short- and long-term memory deficits. Attention and concentration are poor. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Urine toxicology screening is negative. An x-ray of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's concerns?",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "difficulty": 1,
    "hint": "This patient presents with a somatic delusion (broken wrist), flattened affect, avolition, disorganized and pressured speech, poor concentration, and memory deficits, which suggests an acute psychotic episode. Her history of schizophrenia and discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment for the last four months further support this diagnosis.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "Establishing a therapeutic alliance is essential when taking care of patients with delusions. An empathy-based approach, which acknowledges the patient's emotional state, is an effective means of reinforcing the stability of therapeutic alliance and medication compliance. In addition, healthcare providers should avoid validating delusions or confronting patients about the delusional nature of their complaints.",

He reports a persistent fear of “catching germs” from his fellow students and of contracting a deadly disease. He finds it increasingly difficult to attend classes. He avoids handshakes and close contact with other people. He states that when he tries to think of something else, the fears “keep returning” and that he has to wash himself for at least an hour when he returns home after going outside. Afterwards he cleans the shower and has to apply disinfectant to his body and to the bathroom. He does not drink alcohol. He used to smoke cannabis but stopped one year ago. His vital signs are within normal limits. He appears anxious. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person, place, and time. In addition to starting an SSRI, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "explanation_why": "Androgenetic alopecia (AA) can occur at puberty in male individuals. In female individuals, however, it occurs at menopause, when estrogen levels decline and testosterone levels increase. AA may also occur in young women if an underlying hyperandrogenic condition exists (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting ovarian tumors). In such cases, signs of virilization (e.g., hirsutism, acne, irregular menses) will be present in addition to the characteristic tiny vellus hairs in the areas of hair loss. AA does not cause hair loss of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The location and pattern of hair loss and the absence of signs of virilization in this patient make the diagnosis of AA unlikely.",

Although the skin in the hair loss patches may also appear normal in scarring alopecia (since destruction and fibrosis of hair follicles occurs below the surface of the skin), more often than not there are signs of inflammation (e.g., redness, scaling, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation).

In telogen effluvium, the telogen (i.e., resting) phase of hair growth predominates, resulting in premature shedding of the resting hair and diffuse, nonscarring hair loss.

TTM is characterized by a compulsive urge to pull one's hair and consequent feelings of gratification and/or relief from hair pulling. Unlike in obsessive compulsive disorder, individuals with TTM do not experience obsessive or intrusive thoughts. TTM typically manifests in late childhood or early adolescence and is more common in female individuals.

    "question_text": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her 17-year-old son because she believes she has been poisoned by her ex-husband. She reports that her coffee tasted “strange” this morning. After breakfast, she then saw a black car drive by the house, which she concludes must have been her ex-husband, who also drives a black car. She says that since the divorce 3 years ago, her ex-husband has been seeking revenge and thinks that he has installed cameras in her apartment to spy on her and their son. She has never seen any of these cameras but when she is alone in the apartment, she can sometimes hear them beeping and feel them recording her. The son also reports his mother's coffee mug smelled of bitter almonds, which he suspects was cyanide. He agrees with the mother's distrust towards his father and reports that he has also occasionally heard a camera beeping but has not been able to find any cameras yet. The mother's vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows a pH of 7.4. Toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

This warrants assessment for a mental disorder before considering legal measures.",

He started a marketing job 7 months ago, which involves traveling between Washington and California several times a year. Six months ago, he was supposed to fly to Seattle, but he experienced nausea, palpitations, sweating, and shortness of breath and was unable to board the plane, causing him great embarrassment. He had never been on a plane before; his parents died in a plane crash when he was a teenager. A week ago, he called in sick when he was supposed to go on a business trip. He worries that he will lose his job. He is otherwise well and has no history of serious illness. He takes no medications. His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is alert and cooperative. His speech is normal and his thought process is organized. His memory, attention, and concentration are intact. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Patients with a specific phobia experience excessive and irrational fear in anticipation of, or during exposure to, a phobic stimulus. As a result, patients typically develop avoidance behaviors (e.g., this patient calls in sick to avoid air travel). CBT involves exposure therapy (e.g., in vivo, imaginative, virtual reality) and relaxation training to help patients develop cognitive and behavioral strategies to cope with fears and manage anxiety.\n\nThere is little evidence confirming the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for specific phobias.

When she is asked to sit down in the waiting room, she begins to cry and says that no one listens to her. When she is called to the examination room, she moves close to the physician, repeatedly intends to touch his cheek, and makes inappropriate comments.

    "hint": "The patient has a personality disorder that has features that include inappropriately seductive behavior (e.g., flirting with the receptionist, inappropriate contact with the physician), emotional instability (e.g., shifting from flirting to crying and back to flirting), using her physical appearance to draw attention to herself (e.g., dressing extravagantly), and becoming uncomfortable when she is not the center of attention (e.g., coming to the doctor for multiple minor problems, claiming that no one listens to her).",

However, this attention-seeking behavior stems from a desire for praise and admiration rather than from a need for reassurance or approval. Patients with narcissistic personality disorder are more likely to react to criticism or rejection with rage rather than the emotional vulnerability seen here (e.g., crying). In addition, they exhibit other traits not seen in this patient, such as an excessive sense of self-importance, exaggeration of achievements, grandiosity, arrogance, a lack of empathy, and envy.",

Furthermore, chronic pain is a risk factor for depression and generalized anxiety disorder and is a common comorbidity in patients with MDD. However, for this diagnosis, the diagnostic criteria for MDD, which include > 5 of the clinical features of MDD being present for at least 2 weeks, should be fulfilled. As this is not the case here, another diagnosis is more likely.",

Although SLE can manifest with chronic myalgia and joint stiffness, most patients with SLE develop symmetrical, migratory, polyarticular arthritis, which is not seen here. In addition, investigations would show elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) and abnormalities in CBC (e.g., anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia).",

She does not have any friends, spends most of her time alone in her room, and does not feel comfortable around other people. She usually wears long cloaks and large, unusual hats. She wears her shoes to bed because she sleepwalks and claims “nargles” will try to steal them otherwise. Her father is concerned about her going to college because she was bullied in high school. At the end of last year, her father found her putting up posters around the school asking for her possessions to be returned, as the other students had been hiding them. The daughter seemed unconcerned though, saying that “it's all in good fun.” On mental status examination, she seems dreamy and avoids eye contact, but doesn't appear embarrassed about being addressed. Further evaluation discloses no disturbances in thought process, thought content, or perception. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This condition is more common among young women and typically develops after an acute stressor (e.g., trauma, interpersonal conflict). The diagnosis of FND requires thorough evaluation and ruling out of other possible diagnoses, such as a cerebrovascular accident in this patient with unilateral weakness and an unsteady gait after a loss of consciousness.\n\nOther manifestations of FND include seizures, movement and speech disorders, sensory disturbances, and visual impairment.",

He has been evaluated by several urologists but has not received a specific diagnosis despite extensive diagnostic testing. Various pharmacologic treatments have not improved his symptoms. He quit his job 1 year ago and stopped attending social events because his frequent urination has been disruptive. He spends most of his time at the library trying to learn what could be causing his symptoms. He would like to undergo a CT scan of his entire body to evaluate for cancer. Physical examination and laboratory studies show no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation.

She offers to take him back in her own car instead, saying, “This way, I will rest assured that you have reached home safely”. The therapist's behavior can be best described as an instance of which of the following?",

This therapist has likely transferred her feelings toward her deceased son to the patient. Her breaking of neutrality in the absence of an immediate need (e.g., impending harm to the patient) and in order to alleviate her own feelings of anxiety towards the patient's situation suggests countertransference. Awareness of countertransference is necessary to facilitate therapeutic work, as it allows the therapist to circumvent transference of their own insecurities onto the patient.",

Since yesterday, she has also had nausea and has noticed an unusual “electric shock-like” sensation on her skin. She has had major depression for 6 years and multiple sclerosis for 4 years. Her medications are natalizumab and paroxetine, which she stopped taking 1 week ago after having a positive pregnancy test. She appears irritable. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows flat affect, gait instability, tremor, and muscle pain. Muscle strength is normal. An MRI of the brain shows multiple old periventricular white matter lesions. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's current symptoms?",

        "explanation_why": "Abrupt cessation of antidepressant drugs without appropriate tapering, as seen here, can lead to adverse effects in as few as 1–4 days. This patient's presentation (i.e., headache, depressed mood, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, sensory disturbances, irritability, ataxia, tremor, and myalgia) is consistent with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), a known side effect of sudden discontinuation of SSRIs. Paroxetine, in particular, is associated with an increased risk of ADS. The main clinical features of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome can be remembered with the mnemonic FINISH: Flu-like symptoms, Insomnia, Nausea, Instability, Sensory disturbances, and Hyperarousal. Treatment consists of restarting antidepressant therapy at the original dose before beginning to taper slowly for at least 2–4 weeks.\n\nAlthough exposure to SSRIs during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a low risk of teratogenicity, some studies have suggested an increased risk of congenital heart defects related to the use of paroxetine. Nevertheless, the risks of untreated major depression in expectant mothers usually outweigh the potential risks of antidepressant therapy.",

However, serotonin syndrome classically manifests with a triad of neuromuscular excitability (e.g., myoclonus, hyperreflexia), autonomic dysfunction (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, mydriasis), and altered mental status, none of which are present here. Moreover, this condition occurs in patients on ≥ 2 serotonergic drugs or those who switch from one serotonergic drug to another without prior tapering. This patient recently discontinued paroxetine without starting another serotonergic agent, essentially excluding this diagnosis.",

However, PML is associated with focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field deficits), seizures, and altered mental status; none of which are present in this patient. An MRI would show asymmetric, patchy, non-enhancing, multifocal white matter lesions without mass effect.

However, she lacks additional symptoms of MS exacerbation, such as visual changes, motor weakness, and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., bladder disorder). Moreover, the absence of new periventricular white matter lesions on MRI makes an MS relapse unlikely.

The patient says that she cannot breathe and feels like she is dying. Two weeks ago, she was scheduled for an MRI of the pituitary gland because of a 4-month history of amenorrhea and bitemporal hemianopia. During the scan, the patient similarly reported dyspnea and a choking sensation. The procedure was stopped, and the symptoms resolved shortly after she was removed from the MRI scanner; the MRI scan was rescheduled for today. The patient has major depressive disorder well controlled with fluoxetine. Her mother has coronary artery disease. The patient is diaphoretic. Temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 25/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 145/94 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no other abnormalities. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia; there is no evidence of ischemia or right heart strain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

Although panic attacks often self-resolve after a few minutes, as was the case in this patient's prior episode, pharmacotherapy should be considered to relieve her current moderate to severe, persistent symptoms. Because this patient's panic attacks are most likely due to a specific phobia (i.e., claustrophobia), it is appropriate to consider administering a benzodiazepine prior to future procedures.\n\nWhile benzodiazepines are useful for the short-term management of panic attacks, they should not be used for long-term management because of the high potential for addiction and the development of tolerance. For long-term management, cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment, followed by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors if pharmacotherapy is necessary.",

The pain started in the shoulder muscles and then spread to the arms, back, and legs. She often feels stiff in the morning but does not have significant joint pain. She reports that she has had trouble sleeping because of the pain and cannot concentrate during the day. Medical history is remarkable for major depressive disorder. Her only medication is sertraline. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She appears tired. Examination shows tenderness in the arms and legs and along the axial skeleton. There is no joint swelling. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 13.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10 mm/h, and a creatine kinase concentration of 55 U/L. Results of other laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

In addition, initial management of FM should include patient education (including reassurance about the disease and its prognosis and the importance of nonpharmacological measures such as sleep hygiene), treatment of comorbidities (e.g., mood and sleep disorders), and pharmacotherapy with low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline). Cyclobenzaprine, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine), or anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin) can also be used as initial pharmacotherapy.",

Four months ago, he was the driver and sole survivor in a motor vehicle collision that resulted in the deaths of his two brothers. He says, “I replay the moments before the crash in my mind every time I'm in a car.” He used to work as a delivery driver and had to take a leave of absence. He has not had nightmares or difficulty sleeping. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy is initiated but does not lead to significant improvement. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

Patients who respond poorly should be considered for management with a different SSRI or SNRI. If these treatment options are insufficient, second-generation antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine, risperidone) can be considered to augment SSRIs and SNRIs or as monotherapy.\n\nTo remember the features of PTSD, think “TRAUMMA”: Traumatic event, Reexposure, Avoidance, Unable to function, More than a Month of duration, Arousal is increased.",

Affected individuals typically have a depressed mood for most of the day (in children and adolescents, the predominant mood symptom can be irritability). However, in children or adolescents, this condition can only be diagnosed after a 1-year period of symptoms (2 years for adults). This patient's symptoms have only occurred for the past 8 months. Moreover, the effects of a psychoactive substance must be excluded before establishing a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder.",

He regularly uses cannabis, is unable to fulfill obligations at school, exhibits social withdrawal, and has lost interest in activities he used to enjoy (e.g., attending soccer practice), all of which have occurred within the last year. Other manifestations of cannabis use disorder include a persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to decrease cannabis use, tolerance (e.g., more cannabis needed to achieve intoxication), and withdrawal (e.g., development of difficulty with sleep and/or mood changes after abrupt cessation of cannabis use).

Her symptoms began after she attended her grandmother's funeral 3 weeks ago. When she thinks about her grandmother, the shivering intensifies and spreads to her head and right leg. The intensity of the shivering declines when she works on her computer. She has major depressive disorder treated with fluoxetine. She appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows a high-amplitude tremor of the fully relaxed right arm with relative sparing of the fingers. The tremor increases in frequency during a finger-to-nose test. The patient is asked to tap with her left thumb and forefinger and follow a predetermined rhythm set by the physician's hand. When she does so, the frequency of the tremor in her right hand shifts to match the frequency of the tapping of her left hand. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

An essential tremor may be accompanied by an intention tremor and/or a resting tremor. However, essential tremor is most commonly symmetric and slowly progressive, whereas this patient presents with an asymmetric tremor that started promptly. Finally, this patient's tremor is of variable frequency, intensity, and affects various body parts, which is suggestive of another type of tremor.",

This condition is characterized by quick progression to severe symptoms, significant functional disability, and changing of amplitude, frequency, and/or distribution of movement over time. Affected individuals may present with a complex combination of resting, postural, or action tremors that occur simultaneously. Functional tremor typically worsens under direct observation and diminishes with distraction (e.g., while working on the computer). The condition is often associated with psychiatric disorders (e.g., functional neurological symptom disorder, anxiety disorder, depression). Patients are usually unresponsive to drugs for organic movement disorders, but may be responsive to placebo or psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy).",

    "question_text": "A 46-year-old man comes to the physician because of concerns about his sexual performance for the past 3 years. The patient says that every time he sleeps with his life partner, within 30 seconds after penetration he has an orgasm which he cannot delay by any of the methods he has found on the internet. He has not had problems achieving an erection and cannot recall a triggering event for his concerns. Until now, he has never talked to a physician about his concerns because he feels embarrassed.

    "content_preview": "A 46-year-old man comes to the physician because of concerns about his sexual performance for the past 3 years. The patient says that every time he sleeps with his life partner, within 30 seconds after penetration he has an orgasm which he cannot delay by any of the methods he has found on the internet. He has not had problems achieving an erection and cannot recall a triggering event for his concerns. Until now, he has never talked to a physician about his concerns because he feels embarrassed.

        "explanation_why": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine, are used first-line but off-label for the treatment of premature ejaculation in patients without concomitant erectile dysfunction. The indication takes advantage of the side effect profile of SSRIs, which includes ejaculatory delay (up to 9 minutes for paroxetine) and orgasm disturbance. In addition to SSRIs, topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine-prilocaine spray) can be used to reduce the sensitivity of the penis and thereby decrease sexual stimulation. In addition to medical therapy, behavioral therapy can be offered to patients with significant psychological distress (e.g., lack of self-confidence, impaired life quality) and to those in whom psychogenic factors (e.g., anxiety, depression) play a role in the development of premature ejaculation.\n\nIn patients with concomitant erectile dysfunction, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) are used first-line because premature ejaculation is often an outcome of erectile dysfunction. Note that this drug class should be used with caution in patients who are treated with alpha-receptor blockers, such as tamsulosin, because of a risk of orthostatic hypotension.",

He previously went 1 year without wetting the bed. The mother reports that she and her husband have been monitoring their son's voiding habits over the past month. He passes stool of normal color and consistency approximately once daily and voids his bladder 5–7 times per day. He drinks little during dinner and before going to bed. They have not noticed any urgency, hesitancy, straining, postmicturition dribble, or episodes of urinary incontinence during the day. The patient says that he has no pain in his abdominal or genital region prior to, during, or after voiding. He recently started primary school and says he enjoys it. He is able to balance and hop on one foot, tie a knot, name 6 colors, and dress with minimal assistance from his parents. He is at the 50^th percentile for height and weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

These criteria are based on the patient's medical and psychosocial history and include continued drinking despite knowing that physical or psychological problems are likely to have resulted from alcohol use, continued drinking despite exacerbation of social or interpersonal problems (e.g., divorce), inability to fulfill work obligations, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to reduce drinking, and drinking in physically hazardous situations (e.g., driving). AUD severity is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of criteria met. This patient meets several diagnostic criteria for AUD. Assessing the severity of AUD is important for the choice of treatment. Psychosocial intervention alone is the preferred treatment for mild AUD, while a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial intervention is recommended for patients with moderate or severe AUD.",

        "explanation_why": "Breathing retraining (focused on diaphragmatic breathing), removal of stressors, and reassurance are the most appropriate steps for patients with hyperventilation syndrome. Because the condition is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is necessary to evaluate for organic causes (e.g., myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, diabetic ketoacidosis, asthma) that can manifest with episodic hyperventilation, lightheadedness, and chest pain. Hyperventilation syndrome is frequently associated with anxiety and/or panic disorders. This patient shows mild respiratory alkalosis on arterial blood gas analysis, but laboratory studies, ECG, and chest x-ray show no abnormalities, which is consistent with hyperventilation syndrome.",

        "explanation_why": "SNRIs such as venlafaxine, or SSRIs, are the first-line pharmacological treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD), which can manifest with lightheadedness, chest pain, and hyperventilation. However, in SAD, symptoms are connected to social situations (e.g., parties, public speaking) and are associated with the intense and disproportionate fear of being judged or scrutinized, none of which is seen in this patient. Individuals with SAD experience anticipatory anxiety (e.g., worrying weeks in advance about attending an event) and usually try to avoid triggering situations (e.g., refusing to attend school). SNRIs and SSRIs do not provide immediate symptom relief, and they typically require days or weeks of continued use to take effect.",

Acute panic attack is diagnosed in individuals with ≥ 4 cognitive and/or somatic symptoms, but this patient only has 3 (lightheadedness, chest pain, and shortness of breath). Panic attacks occur unpredictably and usually last for several minutes before resolving on their own. Individuals with panic disorder are typically persistently worried about future panic attacks and their consequences and may engage in maladaptive behavior to avoid further episodes.",

Because this patient's chest pain occurs exclusively during episodes of acute hyperventilation and is not related to physical exertion, her pretest probability of CAD is low and does not require further cardiac testing.",

During this time, she has also been tired constantly because she has trouble falling asleep and frequently wakes up from nightmares. She recently immigrated from Mexico. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 54 kg (119 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m^2.

    "question_text": "A 26-year-old woman with borderline personality disorder comes to the psychiatrist for a follow-up examination. Two months ago, she started treatment with fluoxetine because of persistent feelings of emptiness and self-injurious behavior. She has been receiving dialectical behavior therapy from a clinical psychologist for the past year. Before the initiation of pharmacotherapy, the psychiatrist and psychologist met face-to-face to exchange clinical information and establish mutual treatment goals. The patient agreed to the treatment plan, which included both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The patient reports that she stopped going to psychotherapy for 2 weeks because the psychologist is a \"traitor\" who manipulates her emotions.

Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?",
    "content_preview": "A 26-year-old woman with borderline personality disorder comes to the psychiatrist for a follow-up examination. Two months ago, she started treatment with fluoxetine because of persistent feelings of emptiness and self-injurious behavior. She has been receiving dialectical behavior therapy from a clinical psychologist for the past year. Before the initiation of pharmacotherapy, the psychiatrist and psychologist met face-to-face to exchange clinical information and establish mutual treatment goals. The patient agreed to the treatment plan, which included both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The patient reports that she stopped going to psychotherapy for 2 weeks because the psychologist is a &quot;traitor&quot; who manipulates her emotions. The patient says that she only trusts the psychiatrist, who she describes as “my personal hero,” and wants to continue pharmacotherapy.

        "explanation_why": "Treatment for BPD can be challenging because patients may project their feelings onto their providers (e.g., fear of abandonment) or respond to therapy with psychological defense mechanisms. Although a patient always has the right to choose a different provider or to opt out of treatment entirely, they should be encouraged to adhere to the existing treatment plan. In a multiple-provider setting, providers can support each other when patients are resistant to treatment.\n\nIn this scenario, the psychiatrist should remind the patient of the treatment goals and encourage adherence to therapy. All providers involved in patient care should collaborate toward common treatment goals (e.g., emotional stability, improved relationships). Regular communication, clarification of roles, and plans for crisis management (e.g., whom to call in case of an emergency) are necessary in a multiple-provider setting.",

    "question_text": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because she wants to lose weight for her upcoming wedding. In the past 6 months, she has tried several diets without success and feels like she has “lost control” over her eating habits. She says, “At least twice per week, I just load up on junk food, even when I am not even feeling hungry. I feel so disgusted with myself because I am just not able to stop.” Afterward, she typically feels uncomfortably full and lies in bed watching television until her stomach feels better. She is embarrassed about her behavior and avoids eating with her partner because she does not want him to find out. She is concerned that she will look “hideous” on her wedding day and tries to hide her body by wearing oversized clothes. Medical history is remarkable for social anxiety disorder, for which she received cognitive behavioral therapy 5 years ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 65.8 kg (145 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she has a sad affect and repeatedly expresses guilt about her lack of self-control. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Episodes of binge eating are associated with three or more of the following: eating faster than normal, eating until uncomfortably full, eating when not hungry, significant distress, and negative emotions (e.g., embarrassment, disgust, depression, guilt). This disorder has no purging behavior, which is the main difference from bulimia nervosa. Individuals with binge eating disorder can have a BMI that is elevated or within the normal range, and women are more commonly affected. Therapy consists of nutritional management in combination with psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., SSRIs).",
