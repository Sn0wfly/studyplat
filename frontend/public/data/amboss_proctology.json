They are not painful and she does not have blood in her stool. She is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows nontender, irregular, hyperkeratotic sessile lesions in the perianal area around 4–7 mm in diameter. There is no lymphadenopathy. The application of a dilute solution of acetic acid turns the lesions white. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the lesions?",

        "explanation_why": "The molluscum contagiosum (MC) virus is a DNA poxvirus that most commonly affects young children. It also affects adults, particularly those who are immunocompromised (e.g., due to HIV infection, chemotherapy, or extensive corticosteroid therapy). MC is transmitted through direct skin contact, autoinoculation, or fomites. Lesions are typically nontender and located on the face, trunk, and extremities. Sexually transmitted MC can cause lesions in the groin, lower abdomen, and genitals. In contrast to this patient's skin lesions, characteristic MC lesions are pearly, flesh-colored, dome-shaped, and smooth with a central umbilication.",

Moreover, secondary syphilis typically causes generalized lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, fatigue), which this patient does not have. Finally, acetic acid would not turn syphilitic lesions white.",

Rather than multiple smaller growths around the anus, a larger, solitary mass in the anal canal would be more likely.

They are usually asymptomatic but may be painful or pruritic in some cases.

Rectal varices appear as tortuous dilated submucosal veins that extend beyond the levator ani and do not prolapse with pressure.

She has had two episodes of nonbloody vomiting today and has been unable to keep down food or fluids. She has not had a bowel movement since yesterday. She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. She had a cholecystectomy 5 years ago. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 20 years. Current medications include chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and naproxen. Her temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 94 kg (207 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds. There is moderate left lower quadrant tenderness. A tender mass is palpated on digital rectal examination. There is no guarding or rebound tenderness.

Colonoscopy is typically performed once the inflammation has subsided (typically after 6 weeks) to assess the extent of diverticulitis and rule out malignancy. Rectal cancer is an important differential diagnosis in a patient with a palpable mass on DRE. However, given the acute presentation with systemic signs of inflammation (fever, leukocytosis) and the tenderness of the mass, diverticulitis is more likely.",

Typical CT findings include bowel wall thickening (> 4 mm) and inflammation of the pericolonic fat with fat stranding (visible traces of fluid in the fat). A CT scan is also helpful in ruling out complications such as abscess (fluid collections surrounded by inflammatory changes), obstruction (dilated intestinal loops, air-fluid levels), perforation (free air in the abdominal cavity), and fistula (air in organs other than the bowel).\n\nThe treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis can usually occur in an outpatient setting. It includes a restricted, clear liquid diet and bowel rest until pain improves, broad-spectrum oral antibiotics for 7–10 days (e.g., ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole), and pain management, if necessary (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen).",

He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years. His temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. There is no edema of his lower extremities. CT of the abdomen with contrast shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula, surrounding fat stranding, and a 5.5-cm, low-attenuating pelvic fluid collection. Intravenous fluids and bowel rest are started. Treatment with intravenous morphine, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole is begun.

    "difficulty": 3,
    "hint": "This patient's history of constipation and left lower quadrant pain together with CT findings of segmental colonic wall thickening with multiple diverticula and surrounding fat stranding suggest acute diverticulitis. The > 4.0-cm low-attenuating fluid collection is consistent with a large pelvic abscess, which has developed as a complication of diverticulitis. There are no signs that suggest peritonitis (e.g., guarding, rebound tenderness, rigid abdomen). Intravenous antibiotics alone are highly unlikely to resolve this patient's condition.",

Given this patient's age (> 65 years), history of smoking, and recent change in stool habits with hematochezia, colorectal cancer is the most concerning diagnosis and must be ruled out.\n\nAlthough internal hemorrhoid does not take priority over diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer, it does merit intervention in this patient to prevent progression and because it could be contributing to his hematochezia. As it appears to be a grade I internal hemorrhoid (no history of prolapse; see “Grading of internal hemorrhoids” table), conservative therapy (e.g., stool softeners, dietary counseling) is likely necessary.",

Ectopic gastric mucosa can secrete gastric acid within the diverticulum, possibly resulting in ileal ulceration and subsequent bleeding.\n\nThe sensitivity of technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is lower in adults because the adult population tends to have a higher percentage of Meckel diverticulum that lack ectopic gastric mucosa.

        "explanation_why": "The pubocervical fascia, which is located between the cervix and the pubic bone area, forms part of the anterior vaginal wall. Weakness of this fascia results in a loss of support of the urethra and/or bladder, leading to cystocele and/or urethrocele. Patients typically present with urinary symptoms such as urgency, hesitation, incomplete emptying, and urinary incontinence, none of which is seen here. In addition, fecal urgency and a feeling of incomplete evacuation would not be expected. Moreover, anterior rather than posterior bulging of the vaginal wall would be expected during Valsalva maneuver.",

        "explanation_why": "The rectovaginal fascia is part of the fibromuscular structure of the perianal body, and it separates the vagina and the rectum. Acquired weakness of the rectovaginal fascia, e.g., due to multiple vaginal deliveries or low estrogen levels during menopause, can cause herniation of the posterior vaginal wall, which is associated with protrusion of the rectum into the vaginal canal (i.e. rectocele), which can become visible during Valsalva maneuver. Typical symptoms of rectocele include increased fecal urgency and a sensation of incomplete evacuation following defecation. Patients with large rectoceles may report needing to insert their fingers into the vagina to press against the rectovaginal fascia, thereby facilitating the emptying of stool.\n\nFirst-line therapy consists of conservative strategies, such as Kegel exercises, weight loss, a high-fiber diet, and vaginal pessaries.",

Weakness of the uterosacral ligament can lead to uterine procidentia. This type of herniation can cause symptoms similar to those seen in this patient.

    "difficulty": 2,
    "hint": "The anal canal is anatomically divided by the pectinate line into the upper two thirds, which is embryologically derived from the hindgut (endoderm), and the lower third, which is derived from ectoderm. The artery supply, venous drainage, lymphatic drainage, and nerve supply of the region of the anal canal above the dentate line (pectinate line) are, therefore, different from those of the region below this line.",

        "is_correct": true,
        "explanation_why": "The region of the anal canal above the dentate line drains into the portal venous system via the following pathway: superior rectal vein → inferior mesenteric vein → splenic vein → hepatic portal vein. Adenocarcinomas typically arise in this region and usually result in hepatic metastases. The region of the anal canal below the dentate line drains into systemic venous circulation via the following pathway: inferior rectal vein → internal pudendal vein → internal iliac vein → inferior vena cava. Squamous cell carcinomas typically arise in this region. The principles of the upper and lower anal canal's venous drainage are not only relevant for predicting the most likely route of hematogenous spread of malignancies, but also for understanding first pass metabolism in rectal drug administration. First pass metabolism is higher if the drug drains via the superior rectal vein into the hepatic portal circulation.",

            "description": "The splenic, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric veins drain blood from the spleen and digestive organs (with the exception of the lower rectum) and merge to form the hepatic portal vein. The hepatic portal vein thus transports blood to the liver that is rich in nutrients but deoxygenated (therefore represented in blue). Following metabolization in the liver, the blood then passes via the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava to join systemic circulation.",

Digital rectal examination shows a tender mass and bright red blood in the anal canal. Anoscopy shows an exophytic, ulcerated, 2.5-cm (1-in) mass that is located just above the anocutaneous line and below the dentate line. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "content_preview": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of pain with defecation, anal itching, and blood in the stool. Over the past month, she has also had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss. She has a history of irritable bowel syndrome, HIV infection, and human papillomavirus infection. Current medications include a combined antiretroviral treatment regimen and an oral contraceptive. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is sexually active with one male partner. Temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 66/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg. Examination of the perianal region shows no abnormalities.

Furthermore, in a patient with irritable bowel syndrome, constipation is a common feature and a risk factor for developing hemorrhoids. However, internal hemorrhoids more commonly appear as dilated, purple or blue veins on anoscopy rather than an exophytic ulcerated mass, and, because they arise from the superior hemorrhoidal plexus, they are located above the dentate line rather than the anocutaneous line. Moreover, defecation is usually painless and weight loss is not expected.",

He was potty-trained at 4 years but now soils in his clothes 1–2 times a month and does not seem to notice when he needs to go to the bathroom. He now sleeps with pull-up diapers at night and he frequently urinates in them. He has large, hard stools and painful bowel movements once a week. They moved to a new town 5 months ago and the patient has had trouble adjusting. He also started school a few months ago, which according to the mother “only made things worse.” He has bronchial asthma well controlled with a corticosteroid inhaler, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for which he takes methylphenidate. He eats a regular diet but dislikes vegetables apart from green peas and potatoes. He is at the 50^th percentile for weight and 25^th percentile for height. His temperature is 36.7°C (96.1°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is mildly distended and there is firmness to palpation in the left lower quadrant; there is no guarding or rebound. Digital rectal examination shows a normal sphincter tone. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "hint": "According to the DSM-5 criteria, encopresis is defined as the involuntary elimination of feces in children ≥ 4 years in inappropriate settings for their developmental age (e.g., in their clothes, on the floor), occurring more than once a month for ≥ 3 months. Encopresis is classified as either retentive or nonretentive. This patient’s history (large, hard stools with painful bowel movements, nocturia) and physical examination findings (mild abdominal distension, firmness in the left lower quadrant) indicate that he has retentive encopresis.",

This patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with constipation, for which an abdominal x-ray is not required. In patients with constipation, the digital rectal examination may show a distended rectum filled with stool. However, a normal digital rectal exam does not exclude the diagnosis.",

        "explanation_why": "This patient's clinical and physical findings are consistent with retentive encopresis, the most common type of encopresis. Symptoms typically develop as a result of underlying constipation and stool impaction, with consequent overflow past the impaction and soiling of underwear. Retentive encopresis develops when the urge to defecate is suppressed; triggering situations include starting school (e.g., due to limited time, lack of privacy, unhygienic toilets), and avoidance of painful defecation (e.g., constipation, anal fissures). In younger children, constipation can develop during potty training or the transition to solid food. Treatment consists of fecal disimpaction with enemas or oral agents (polyethylene glycol), followed by maintenance laxative therapy for 6–24 months. An ongoing healthy high-fiber diet along with age-appropriate physical activity is also recommended. For children with encopresis, additional behavioral interventions (e.g., regular toilet regimen, positive reinforcement), cognitive behavioral therapy, and biofeedback training (to improve control of perianal musculature) should be considered. \n\nEncopresis itself can cause significant psychological distress in children. Parents should therefore be advised to support their children and provide positive feedback and reinforcement throughout the entire duration of treatment.",

However, this patient has no other signs of a spinal cord lesion (e.g., abnormal sphincter tone, muscle weakness). His presentation is more consistent with constipation, which is the most likely cause of his fecal incontinence. Because of the close proximity of the rectum, anus, and urinary tract, urinary incontinence often occurs simultaneously with constipation (e.g., due to compression of the bladder, changes in neural stimulation to the bladder and pelvic floor).",

Most perianal abscesses result from obstruction of anal crypt glands (e.g., due to bacteria, fecal debris, or foreign matter) with subsequent infection and abscess formation. Prompt management is essential for the prevention of possible complications such as secondary fistula formation, tissue necrosis, and anal sphincter involvement with consequent fecal incontinence. While imaging (e.g., anal ultrasonography, CT, MRI) can confirm the diagnosis and show the extent of tissue involvement, treatment is generally initiated based on high clinical suspicion. Postoperative antibiotics are not routinely used but can be considered in certain patients (e.g., immunocompromised individuals).\n\nOther causes of perianal abscesses include inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn disease), complicated diverticulitis, and malignancy (e.g., colorectal cancer).",

She does not have pain with defecation and has not noticed any rectal bleeding. Her last bowel movement was yesterday. She has not had any recent changes in her diet. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus. All of her children were delivered vaginally without complications. She recently became sexually active again with a new male partner. Medications are metformin and a fish oil supplement. Vital signs are within normal limits. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds are normal. Upon straining, there is a soft, red mass measuring 6 cm in length protruding from the anus; concentric folds can be seen in the protruding tissue. Palpation of the mass does not cause pain. Digital rectal examination shows a reduced sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",

        "explanation_why": "Surgical repair with rectopexy is the recommended management for full-thickness rectal prolapse, which is more common in adults and is usually associated with weakness of the pelvic floor muscles (e.g., due to multiple pregnancies, perineal surgery, advanced age) and/or increased intraabdominal pressure (e.g., due to excessive straining with constipation, chronic cough). Patients commonly present with a painless rectal mass characterized by concentric mucosal folds, abdominal discomfort, incomplete evacuation, and perianal pruritus. Fecal incontinence can also occur as a result of stretching of the anal sphincter by the prolapsed rectum. The diagnosis is primarily clinical. In older patients, a rectal neoplasm can cause rectal intussusception, which in turn can lead to rectal prolapse. Therefore, preoperative proctoscopy and/or colonoscopy are typically performed in this group of patients.\n\nPartial rectal prolapse, on the other hand, is more common in children and can be managed conservatively.",
