Her medical history is remarkable for Crohn disease, for which she had to undergo segmental small bowel resection several times because of intestinal obstruction and fistula formation. She was previously started on infliximab, which she stopped taking 9 months ago. Examination shows several bullous, erythematous perioral plaques. There are two well-circumscribed circular patches of hair loss on her scalp. A deficiency of which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

        "explanation_why": "Early oral feeding reduces the risk of infectious complications by decreasing gastrointestinal dysmotility, gut permeability, and the likelihood of bacterial translocation. Therefore, oral feeding should be initiated as soon as tolerated (i.e. not causing pain, nausea, or vomiting), ideally within 24 hours. Complete bowel rest, which was previously recommended, is unnecessary in most patients. Enteral feeding can be delivered orally or via an enteral tube, and success has been demonstrated with various diets (e.g., liquid, low-fat, full-solid).",

Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a soft and gravid abdomen with normal bowel sounds. There is guarding on the left lateral side and tenderness to palpation over the left costovertebral angle. Urinalysis shows hematuria but no proteinuria or pyuria. Ultrasonography of the kidneys shows a 4 mm stone in the left proximal ureter with mild hydronephrosis.

A low-calcium diet decreases intestinal excretion of oxalate, freeing up more for absorption. As a result, the increased urinary oxalate binds more calcium in the renal tubule, which can precipitate calcium oxalate stones, the most common type of kidney stones. Therefore, this patient would not benefit from a low-calcium diet.",

Thiazides are primarily indicated for patients with hypercalciuria, as they increase calcium reabsorption from the renal tubule, which decreases the amount of tubular calcium available for precipitation and stone formation. Diuretics are generally avoided in pregnancy because of the increased risk of dehydration and volume depletion. Additionally, thiazide diuretics in particular can cause fetal side effects such as thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia. Furthermore, thiazide diuretics should only be considered to prevent stone recurrence after conducting a metabolic evaluation, which is not routinely performed in first-time stone formers.",

Therefore, this patient should be advised not to exceed the recommended daily protein intake (10–35% of total daily calories). Other conservative measures for calcium stones include generous hydration (the most important intervention; fluid intake should be ≥ 2.5 L/day), a low-sodium diet (prevents dehydration), and reduced consumption of oxalate-rich foods. In patients with recurrent calcium-containing stones with idiopathic hypercalciuria, thiazide diuretics (increase tubular reabsorption of Ca^2+, which decreases urinary Ca^2+) and urine alkalinization (e.g., with potassium citrate) can be considered.",

Vitamin D in its active form, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, raises serum calcium and phosphate levels by increasing absorption from the intestine and kidneys. At high levels, vitamin D also stimulates bone resorption, resulting in calcium and phosphate release. Moreover, vitamin D directly suppresses PTH release, explaining the low PTH levels. The next step in management is to measure serum concentrations of the vitamin D metabolites in order to confirm the etiology of this patient's hypercalcemia.",

            "description": "When serum calcium levels decrease, parathyroid chief cells secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium levels via the following mechanisms:1. PTH activates osteoclasts, which degrade bone, thereby releasing calcium and phosphate.\n2. In the kidneys, PTH stimulates calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule and decreases phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule.\n3. PTH increases the expression of 1α-hydroxylase in the kidneys, an enzyme required to synthesize calcitriol. Calcitriol, in turn, stimulates renal and intestinal reabsorption of both calcium and phosphate. In contrast to PTH, calcitriol promotes the mineralization of bone using calcium and phosphate.",

Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) can lead to bruising and immunosuppression, the latter of which is consistent with this patient's 3-month history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. However, immunosuppression is not specific to scurvy and this patient does not have other dermatological manifestations of scurvy such as perifollicular hemorrhages, petechiae, and corkscrew hairs. Her history of frequent stumbling at night and triangular keratin plaques on the conjunctiva suggest a different deficiency.",

Because vitamin A is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and retinal pigmentation, retinol deficiency results in dermatological and ophthalmological manifestations, such as xerosis cutis and Bitot spots. A deficiency in vitamin A can also cause immunosuppression, which explains this patient's recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Moreover, this patient's recent history of stumbling in the dark most likely results from night blindness (nyctalopia), another common manifestation of vitamin A deficiency.",

Accordingly, no lipoproteins that contain apo B (e.g., chylomicrons, LDL, VLDL) are present in serum, which leads to fat malabsorption. Because dietary intake of fats exacerbates hereditary abetalipoproteinemia, treatment includes a low-fat diet with restriction of long-chain fatty acids. Patients also require supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins.\n\nLate manifestations of hereditary abetalipoproteinemia include retinitis pigmentosa, coagulopathy, myopathy, and spinocerebellar degeneration (due to vitamin E deficiency).",

Thiamine plays an important role as a cofactor in cerebral glucose metabolism, myelin sheath maintenance, and synthesis of neurotransmitters. Disruption of these processes due to thiamine deficiency results in impaired axonal conduction and causes the characteristic features of both Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome.

        "explanation_why": "The vitamin D content of breast milk is not considered to be high enough to prevent complications from developing in infants. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation is recommended in all exclusively breastfed infants until the recommended daily vitamin D intake through diet is met. Dietary sources of vitamin D include ≥ 34 oz/day of infant formula, solid foods, and, once the infant is 12 months old, vitamin D-fortified whole milk. This supplementation protects against hypocalcemia and rickets, a disease of bone deformities in children due to a deficiency of vitamin D. Rickets is characterized by impaired calcification of the bones, delayed closure of the fontanelles, frontal bossing, prominence of costochondral junctions (“rachitic rosary”), and genu valgum or genu varum. Children with rickets present with varying degrees of pain, poor growth, motor delays, and an increased risk of infections.",

Vitamin C does not typically need to be supplemented in infants' diets as adequate amounts are found in both breast milk and in most formulas. Therefore, in the absence of severe malnutrition or malabsorption, this patient is unlikely to need additional vitamin C supplementation.",

The pain is sharp, colicky, and lasts about an hour after meals. Her stools are light in appearance and difficult to flush. Physical examination shows tenderness in the right upper quadrant.

    "hint": "This patient's decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and postprandial, colicky right upper quadrant pain suggest cholelithiasis. The floating, light-colored stool likely results from fat malabsorption due to bile acid deficiency. Therefore, this patient is prone to developing fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.",

Fat malabsorption itself should not affect water-soluble vitamins, though some conditions include deficiency in both (e.g., concomitant B, D, and iron deficiency in celiac disease). Folic acid deficiency, for instance, can occur with a decreased intestinal surface area to absorb nutrients, increased physical demand (pregnancy), or decreased dietary intake. Pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency) can be due to intestinal malabsorption or lack of intrinsic factor. Thiamine deficiency is commonly observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder or diets reliant on polished rice and milled white cereals. Check for other malabsorption syndromes as a differential diagnosis.",

It is an uncommon condition in developed countries, but specific populations, such as patients with fat malabsorption disorders (e.g., chronic pancreatitis, abetalipoproteinemia, cystic fibrosis) are at significant risk. Vitamin E deficiency is harmful to neurons and red blood cells specifically as they are particularly sensitive to the oxidative damage that results from the loss of vitamin E antioxidative effects.",

Although PKU does present with intellectual disabilities, which are seen in this patient, it is not associated with marfanoid habitus, lens luxation, or vascular events.

Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency or decreased affinity of the enzyme for vitamin B6 can be treated with B6 supplementation. However, only about 50% of patients are pyridoxine-responsive. Because cystathionine synthase deficiency results in the accumulation of thrombogenic homocysteine, it predisposes to thromboembolic events (e.g., acute stroke). Lowering the plasma homocysteine concentration is therefore the single most important factor for reducing the risk of vascular events.",

Infants born to thiamine-deficient mothers can develop infantile beriberi, which, if untreated, can be life-threatening.

        "explanation_why": "Vitamin K levels are low in all newborns because very little crosses the placental barrier, and its concentration in breast milk is insignificant. In addition, newborns have sterile intestines, and the establishment of gut microflora that synthesizes vitamin K takes approximately 6 months. As vitamin K is necessary for the production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, not supplementing it within a few hours after birth can enable a potentially fatal hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Another risk factor for vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn is prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency would usually remain asymptomatic unless it led to rickets, which is not a life-threatening condition and not common in industrialized nations.

Moreover, osteoporosis would not explain the myopathic weakness seen here.",

        "explanation_why": "Severe vitamin D deficiency can lead to hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia by decreasing the amount of calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestine. As long as calcium levels are low, increased PTH secretion occurs in an attempt to maintain normal serum calcium levels (secondary hyperparathyroidism). PTH releases calcium stored in bone into serum by increasing bone turnover, which the elevated ALP levels (a marker of bone turnover) indicate here. Increased PTH levels also worsen hypophosphatemia by decreasing renal phosphate reabsorption.\n\nChronic inflammation of the ileum in patients with Crohn disease can cause impaired reabsorption of bile acids, resulting in fat malabsorption; unabsorbed fats can trap fat-soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamin D) in the intestinal lumen, causing a deficiency.",

Also, patients with PHP or renal osteodystrophy can have muscle weakness (due to myopathy) and radiological features of osteomalacia such as Looser zones, as seen here. However, renal osteodystrophy would not occur until the very late stage of CKD (i.e., when renal replacement therapy is required). PHP, on the other hand, would typically manifest during childhood with features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (e.g., short stature, round face, obesity, short fourth metacarpals, soft tissue calcifications, dental hypoplasia).",

Carbamoyl phosphate then enters the urea cycle by reacting with ornithine to form citrulline. Citrulline is transported via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter into the cytosol. In an ATP-dependent reaction, argininosuccinate synthase condenses citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate. Next, argininosuccinate is cleaved into fumarate and arginine, which in turn is cleaved by arginase into urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transported back into the mitochondrion via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter and thus becomes available for reacting with carbamoyl phosphate in a new cycle. Urea is excreted via the kidneys.",

However, patients with hyperammonemia due to hepatotoxicity would have icterus. Furthermore, classic galactosemia would not cause low citrulline levels and would likely manifest with infantile cataracts.",

His joint pain may be caused by hemarthroses from vitamin C deficiency or may be due to his underlying osteoarthritis. Populations at increased risk for developing nutritional deficiencies include individuals with substance use disorders, the elderly, and patients who are chronically ill, such as this man with non-small cell lung carcinoma who may have poor intake due to loss of appetite and chemotherapy-induced nausea. The treatment for scurvy is vitamin C supplementation.",

        "explanation_why": "ALS is characterized by concomitant upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron dysfunction and can manifest with pseudobulbar palsy and bulbar palsy, both of which result in dysphagia. Dysphagia increases the risk for aspiration and/or insufficient fluid and food intake, leading to complications in patients with ALS (e.g., aspiration pneumonia, weight loss). A bedside swallowing test should therefore be performed in all patients with ALS to screen for dysphagia. If the test is positive, a formal swallowing study (e.g., videofluoroscopic swallowing examination) is required to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with ALS who have swallowing difficulties may need specialized nutritional support (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids, nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). Bedside swallowing test is also performed for other neurological conditions that manifest with dysphagia, such as Parkinson disease, acute stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\nIn addition to the bedside swallowing test, this patient should be asked about their wishes regarding resuscitation. ALS can result in cognitive impairment in the later stages, and the patient's resuscitation wishes (e.g., do not resuscitate order) should be determined while their mental faculties are intact.",

Many athletes have borderline low BMI and blood pressure as well as physiological sinus bradycardia. However, these findings in combination with xerosis and low body temperature raise suspicion for caloric restriction, which requires evaluation of dietary history.\n\nOther risk factors for stress fractures include calcium and vitamin D deficiencies, improper technique during physical activity, and ill-fitting footwear.",

She has been a vegetarian ever since she watched a documentary about industrial livestock farming. Last month, she joined a group of friends who toured a dairy farm in their neighboring village in Montana, which convinced her to become a vegan and consume only unprocessed foods. She eats a well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts. The parents are concerned that she will not get enough nutrition. The patient just finished her soccer season and plans on joining the ski team for the winter season next month. She has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. She is annoyed about the concerns of her parents and believes a vegan diet will not only help save animal lives but also protect the planet. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 60 kg (132 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m^2. The physician should counsel the patient that without supplements, she is at increased risk of developing which of the following nutritional deficiency?",

        "explanation_why": "People who follow a vegan diet have a higher risk of developing vitamin D deficiency compared to the general population. This is due to the fact that a vegan diet does not include dairy, which is a major dietary source of vitamin D. Therefore, individuals who transition to a vegan diet should be advised to consume sufficient amounts of vitamin D-fortified foods (e.g., plant-based milk alternatives, cereal, juices) to achieve the recommended daily dose of vitamin D. They should also be counseled on the importance of exposure to sunlight, another major source of vitamin D, to boost the endogenous production of vitamin D, which is often deficient in individuals who live in northern latitudes (like this patient from Montana), especially during the Winter season.\n\nApart from vitamin D, a vegan diet is often deficient in calcium, vitamin B_12, and iron. Patients should be counseled on supplementation to avoid nutritional deficiencies.",

        "explanation_why": "In prolonged catabolic states (e.g., due to chronic malnutrition), energy stores, as well as vitamins (notably thiamine) and intracellular electrolytes are depleted. Renutrition and ensuing rising glucose concentrations cause insulin release, which leads to an intracellular shift of glucose, phosphorus (needed for phosphorylation of glucose in glycolysis), magnesium, and potassium. The resulting drops in serum electrolyte concentrations can cause severe complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. To prevent RS, energy intake should be increased gradually and serum electrolytes must be monitored closely and repleted as necessary.",

During renutrition, glucose-dependent metabolic pathways are increasingly activated.

He also reports difficulty walking and occasional blurred vision. His medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus. He used to work as an accountant but lost his job 8 months ago. His diet has primarily consisted of white rice for the past 6 months due to socioeconomic hardship. His only medication is metformin, which he has been taking inconsistently for the past 8 months. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He appears thin and malnourished. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows bilateral foot drop, diminished sensation to light touch and pinprick in his hands and feet, and absent deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities. Cranial nerve examination shows horizontal nystagmus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He appears thin and malnourished. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows bilateral foot drop, diminished sensation to light touch and pinprick in his hands and feet, and absent deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities. Cranial nerve examination shows horizontal nystagmus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Chronic thiamine deficiency results in dry beriberi (characterized by symmetrical peripheral neuropathy and progressive muscle wasting) and Wernicke encephalopathy (characterized by confusion, oculomotor dysfunction with nystagmus, and gait ataxia). Some patients may also develop features of wet beriberi (e.g., high-output cardiac failure). Risk factors for thiamine deficiency include malnutrition, malabsorption, and heavy drinking. Thiamine replacement is essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage.",
